       La Fa#m Do#m

La   Fa#m       Do#m
 I'm fighting a battle
La   Fa#m        Do#m
 I'm fighting my shadow
La    Fa#m               Do#m
 Herd fears like they're cattle
La   Fa#m       Do#m
 I'm fighting a battle, yeah
Remaj7            Fa#m
 I'm fighting my ego
Mi                    Sim
 Lost youth where did we go wrong
Remaj7              Fa#m
 I'm fighting for me though
Mi                Sim
 I'm lighting the long way home

                   La
Oh the past it haunted me
                  Fa#m9
Oh the past it wanted me dead
                  Do#m
Oh the past tormented me

But the battle was lost

'Cause I'm still here

La   Fam         Do#m
 I'm winning the war now
La   Fa#m       Do#m
 I'm winning it all now
La     Fa#m             Do#m
 Watch tears while they fall down
La   Fa#m        Do#m
 I'm winning the war now
Remaj7           Fa#m
 I win against ego
Mi                 Sim
 Cast light on the shadow's long
Remaj7              Fa#m
 I'm winning from ego
Mi                Sim
 I'm lighting the long way home
