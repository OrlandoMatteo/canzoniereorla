[<pre>Do Fa


Do                                    Rem7
I've been staring at the edge of the water
                 Lam                      Fa
'Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
Do                             Rem7
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
                       Lam                         Fa
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try
      Lam
Every turn I take, every trail I track
      Sol
Every path I make, every road leads back
       Do
To the place I know, where I can not go
         Fam
Where I long to be

[Chorus 1]
        Do                                      Sol
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
           Lam                Fa
And no one knows, how far it goes
       Do                                    Sol
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
             Lam         Fam                   
One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go

 
Do Sol Lam Fa


Do                         Rem7                         Lam
I know, everybody on this island seems so happy on this island
                Fa
Everything is by design
Do                         Rem7                     Lam
I know, everybody on this island has a role on this island
                      Fa
So maybe I can roll with mine
      Lam
I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
        Sol
I'll be satisfied if I play along
        Do
But the voice inside sings a different song
        Fam
What is wrong with me?

 
        Do                                      Sol
See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
           Lam                 Fa
But no one knows, how deep it goes
       Do                                             Sol
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
           Lam             Fa
And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?

See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
           La#m               Fa#
And no one knows, how far it goes
       Do#                                   Sol#
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
             La#m                Fa#m                   
One day I'll know, how far I'll go
