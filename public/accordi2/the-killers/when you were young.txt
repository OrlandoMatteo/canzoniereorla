Mi Fa# Sol#m Si Mi
Mi Fa# Sol#m Si Mi


    Mi                  Fa#     Sol#m
You sit there in your heart-ache
    Si              Mi
Waiting on some beautiful boy to
 Mi                Fa#       Sol#m
To save you from your old ways
 Si                           
You play forgiveness
Mi
Watch it now Here he comes


    Mi                       Fa# Sol#m   
He doesnt look a thing like Je-sus
            Si                        
But he talks like a gentleman
 Mi
Like you imagined
              Fa# Sol#m  
When you were young         


Si       Mi


 Mi            
Can we climb this mountain
 Fa#     Sol#m
I dont know
 Si                        Mi
Higher now than ever before
 Mi                           Fa#      Sol#m 
I know we can make it if we take it slow
 Si
Let's take it easy
  Mi
Easy now,  watch it go


 Mi                             Fa#   Sol#m
We're burning down the highway sky- line
         Si
On the back of a hurricane
 Mi 
That started turning
               Fa#  Sol#m     Si    Mi
When you were   young
               Fa#  Sol#m     Si   Mi
When you were   young


       Mi           Fa#          Sol#m
And sometimes you close your eyes
              Si                      Mi
And see the place where you used to live
                Fa#  Sol#m     Si     Mi
When you were    young


Mi  Fa#  Sol#m  Si  Mi
Mi  Re#m   Do#m   Si   La#m   Sol#m    Fa#


            Do#m
The say the devil's water, it ain't so sweet.
    Mi                         Sol#m
You don't have to drink right now.
Re#m                     Sol#m
   But you can dip your feet.
Fa#                     Mi    Fa#  Sol#m Si    Mi 
   Every once in a little while.


Mi  Fa#  Sol#m  Si  Mi 


    Mi                  Fa#     Sol#m
You sit there in your heart-ache
    Si                       Mi
Waiting on some beautiful boy to
 Mi                Fa#       Sol#m
To save you from your old ways
 Si                           
You play forgiveness
Mi
Watch it now Here he comes


    Mi                       Fa# Sol#m   
He doesnt look a thing like Je-sus
            Si                        
But he talks like a gentleman
 Mi
Like you imagined
              Fa# Sol#m  
When you were young         
 Si       
(talks like a gentleman)
 Mi
(like you imagined)
 Mi            Fa#  Sol#m           Si   Mi
When you were young

[Chorus &amp; Outro]
                               Fa#   Sol#m    Si   Mi
I said he doesnt look a thing like Jesus      
                           Fa#   Sol#m       Si    Mi
He doesnt look a thing like Jesus
           Mi  Re#m   Do#m   Si   La#m   Sol#m   Fa#   
But more than you'll ever know</pre>]
