 Step out into the Indian dust

 She's just another girl,
              Do#                       Fa#

Re#m                        Si     Do#          Fa#
 and it's a great big world, she's just another girl

I went to see a fortuneteller, that was a trip
Do#                           La#m7

something's got a hold on me, tonight
