Do                   Do/Si
  Coming out of my cage   
                          Fa
And I've been doing just fine  
                 
Gotta gotta be down 
                   
Because I want it all 
Do                       Do/Si
  It started out with a kiss
                         Fa 
How did it end up like this? 
              
It was only a kiss    
                
It was only a kiss
Do                   Do/Si
  Now I'm falling asleep
                     Fa
And she's calling a cab  
                    
While he's having a smoke   
                 
And she's taking the drag 
Do                      Do/Si
  Now they're going to bed
                   Fa
And my stomach is sick    
              
And it's all in my head 
                  
But she's touching his 



 Lam
Сhest now 
                   Sol
He takes off her dress now
       Fa
Let me go
Lam            
  I just can't look
      Sol
It's killing me
     Fa
And taking control 


Do
Jealousy
Fa               Lam
Turning saints into the sea
Sol                      Do
Swimming through sick lullabies
Fa               Lam
Choking on your alibis
Sol                  Do
But it's just the price I pay
Fa          Lam
Destiny is calling me
Sol          Do     Fa
Open up my eager eyes
Lam                  Sol       
   ‘Cause I'm Mr. Brightside
