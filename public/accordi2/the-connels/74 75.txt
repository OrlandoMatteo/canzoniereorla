  Got no reason for coming to me and the rain running  down.
           Si      Sol#m
There's no reason.
Mi        Si         Mi                     Si  Fa#/La#  Mi
  And the same voice coming to me like it's all slowing  down.
      Si        Fa#
And believe me

          Sol#m           Si               Fa#        Mi     Sol#m  Si  Fa#
I was the one who let you know, I was your sorry-ever-after. '74 - '75

Mi         Si    Mi                         Si  Fa#/La#  Mi
  It's not easy, nothing to say 'cause it's al- ready    said.
           Si    Sol#m
It's never easy.
       Mi           Si          Sol#m     Fa#     Mi
When I look on your eyes then I find that I'll do fine.
       Sol#m        Si             Fa#
When I look on your eyes then I do better.
