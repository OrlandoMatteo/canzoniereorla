Mr. Crowley, what went on in your head?
     Si Do#                          La
Oh, Mr. Crowley, did you talk to the dead?
     Si
Your life style to me seemed so tragic
         Do#m
With the thrill of it all
    Si
You fooled all the people with magic
          La                Sol#
Yeah, you waited on Satan's call

Mr. Charming, did you think you were pure?
    Si Do#m                   La
Mr. Alarming, in nocturnal rapport
  Si
Uncovering things that were sacred
    Do#m
Manifest on this Earth
   Si
Conceived in the eye of a secret

And they scattered the afterbirth

Mr. Crowley, won't you ride my white horse?
 Si Do#m                       La
Mr. Crowley, it's symbolic, of course
  Si
Approaching a time that is classic

I hear that maidens call
  Si
Approaching a time that is drastic
La                               Sol#
Standing with their backs to the wall
