Wondering will mother earth survive
Fa#                           Re#m            Sol#   Sol#4 Sol#
Hoping that mankind will stop abusing her, sometime

After all there's only just the two of us
    Do#                                La#m
And here we are still fighting for our lives
Fa#                      Re#m                    Sol#   Sol#4 Sol#

I watch the sun go down like everyone of us
    Do#                               La#m
I'm hoping that the dawn will bring a sign
  Fa#                                 Re#m           Sol#   Sol#4 Sol#

Your higher power may be God or Jesus Christ

It doesn't really matter much to me
   Re#m                                 Sol#        Sol#4 Sol#
Without each others help there ain't no hope for us
