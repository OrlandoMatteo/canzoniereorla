Mi                                La
Goodbye Norma Jean, though I never knew you at all
       Mi/Sol#      La
You had the grace to hold yourself while those around you crawled
   Mi      La
They crawled out of the woodwork and they whispered into your brain
     Mi/Sol#       La
They sent you on a treadmill and they made you change your name

       Si    Si7
And it seems to me you lived your life
       Mi            La
Like a candle in the wind
      Mi                 Si
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
      La                                         Do#m
And I would have liked to've known you but I was just a kid
                       Si               La  Mi/Sol# Fa#m Mi
Your candle burned out long before your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough, the toughest role you ever played
                    Mi/Sol#                              La
Hollywood created a superstar and pain was the price you paid
                  Mi            La
And even when you died, oh, the press still hounded you
               Mi/Sol#                               La
All the papers had to say was that Marilyn was found in the nude

       Si    Si7
And it seems to me you lived your life
       Mi            La
Like a candle in the wind
      Mi                 Si
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
      La                                         Do#m
And I would have liked to've known you but I was just a kid

You had the grace to hold yourself while those around you crawled
Mi                                          La
Goodbye Norma Jean, from a young man in the twenty second row
                          Mi/Sol#
Who sees you as something more than sexual,
                       La
more than just our Marilyn Monroe

       Si    Si7
And it seems to me you lived your life
       Mi            La
Like a candle in the wind
