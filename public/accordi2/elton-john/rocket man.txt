[<pre>Mim7                                  La9
She packed my bags last night - pre-flight
Mim7               La9
Zero hour, nine A.M.
Do                Sol         Lam      Re
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
Mim7                         La9
I miss the earth so much, I miss my wife
Mim7                 La9
It's lonely out in space
Do         Sol        Lam       Re
On such a timeless flight


Sol                                     Do
 And I think it's gonna be a long long time
                                        Sol
Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
                                   Do
I'm not the man they think I am at home
           Sol         La9
Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
Do                                   Sol           Do
Rocket man, burnin' out his fuse up here alone

Sol                                     Do
 And I think it's gonna be a long long time
                                        Sol
Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
                                   Do

Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
Do                                   Sol           Do

Mars ain't the kinda place to raise your kids
Mim7                  La9
In fact it's cold as hell
Do                   Sol       Lam                Re
And there's no one there to raise them if you did
Mim7                               La9
And all this science, I don't understand
Mim7                         La9
It's just my job five days a-week
Do        Sol  Lam          Re
Rocket man - - - rocket man


Sol                                     Do
 And I think it's gonna be a long long time
