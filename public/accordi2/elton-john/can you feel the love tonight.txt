Do              Sol/Si
There's a calm surrender
Do              Sol/Si
To the rush of day
Do                    Sol/Si
When the heat of the rolling world
Lam7            Re
Can be turned away
Do            Sol/Si 
An enchanted moment
Do              Sol/Si
And it sees me through
Do                    Mim
It's enough for this restless warrior
Fa               Re
Just to be with you


    Sol       Re/Fa#     Mim      Do
And can you feel the love tonight?
Sol       Do     La/Do# Re
  It is where we   are
Do            Sol/Si         Mim   Sol/Re  Do
  It's enough   for this wide-eyed wanderer
Lam   Sol  Do   La/Do# Re
That we got this far
    Sol       Re/Fa#     Mim     Do
And can you feel the love tonight?
Sol          Do     La/Do# Re
  How it's laid  to   rest?
Do            Sol/Si        Mim    Sol/Re Do
  It's enough   to make kings and vagabonds
  Lam    Sol   Do/Re  Do/Sol Sol
Believe the ve - ry  best

Do                  Sol/Si
There's a time for everyone
Do            Sol/Si
If they only learn
Do                   Sol/Si
That the twisting kaleidoscope
Lam              Re
Moves us all in turn
Do                   Sol/Si
There's a rhyme and reason
Do              Sol/Si
To the wild outdoors
Do                      Mim
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager
Fa                  Re
Beats in time with yours
