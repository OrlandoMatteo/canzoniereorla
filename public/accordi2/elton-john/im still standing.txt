 You could never know what it's like
     Fa/La#                    La#
Your blood like winter freezes just like ice
              Dom7/La#                           Fa
And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you

You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
                                  Re#/La#
And did you think this fool could never win?
     Fa/La#                 La#
Well look at me, I'm coming back again
        Dom7/La#                  Fa
I got a taste of love in a simple way

And if you need to know while I'm still standing
         La#
you just fade   a  -   way

Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did

Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
La#m7                    Sol#6
I'm still standing after all this time
               Re#m7                         Fam7
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
          La#m      Re#m7      Fa7

 Once I never could hope to win
    Fa/La#                         La#
You starting down the road leaving me again

The threats you made were meant to cut me down
           Solm            Re#               La#
And if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now
