I remember when rock was young, me and Susie had so much fun
        Do                               Re
Holding hands and skimmin' stones  had a old gold Chevy a place of my own
        Sol                                 Sim
But the biggest kick I ever got was doin' a thing called the Crocodile Rock
          Do                                               Re7
While the other kids were rockin' 'round the clock we were hoppin' and

boppin' to the Crocodile Rock, well

Mim                                                La7
 Crocodile Rockin' is something shockin' when your feet just can't keep still
Re7                                 Sol
 I never had me a better time and I guess I never will
Mi7                                     La7
Oh, Lady mamma those Friday nights when Susie wore her dresses tight and
Re7                               Do4  Do  Do4  Do  Do4 Do
 the Crocodile Rockin' was out of sight

But the years went by and rock just died, Susie went left me for some

foreign guy,
Do                                       Re7
Long nights cryin' by the record machine dreamin' of my Chevy my old

blue jeans but they'll
Sol                                      Sim
Never kill the thrills we've got burnin' up to the Crocodile Rock,
         Do                                       Re7
Learning fast till the weeks went past, we really thought the Crocodile

Rock would last, well
