It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
Sim             Sim/La          Sim/Sol#  Sol 
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
Re/La               La           Fa#       Sim 
I don't have much money, but, boy if I did
Re             Mim          Sol             La    La4 – La 
I'd buy a big house where we both could live



Re          Solmaj7     La/Do#           Fa#m 
If I was a sculptor, but then again no
Sim                 Sim/La         Sim/Sol#      Sol 
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
Re/La             La                 Fa#         Sim 
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
Re             Mim        Sol             Re – Re4 – Re  
My gift is my song, and this one for you



La/Do#             Sim        Mim           Sol 
And you can tell everybody this is your song
La/Do#      Sim               Mim            Sol 
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
Sim                     Sim/La     
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
Sim/Sol#             Sol6 
That I put down in words,
    Re/Fa#      Sol6            Sol             La   La4 – La 
How wonderful life is while you're in the world


Re            Solmaj7  La/Do#               Fa#m 
I sat on the roof,  and kicked off the moss
Sim                Sim/La           Sim/Sol#        Sol 
Well a few of the verses they've got me quite crossed
Re/La                La           Fa#                 Sim 
But the sun's been quite kind, while I wrote this song
Re                    Mim            Sol           La   La4 – La
It's for people like you that they keep turned on



Re            Solmaj7       La/Do#        Fa#m 
So excuse me forgetting, but these I do
Sim              Sim/La              Sim/Sol#            Sol 
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Re/La         La                Fa#      Sim 
Anyway, the thing is, what I reallly mean
Re             Mim            Sol         Re – Re4 – Re  
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen



La/Do#             Sim        Mim           Sol 
And you can tell everybody this is your song
La/Do#      Sim               Mim            Sol 
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
Sim                     Sim/La     
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
Sim/Sol#             Sol6 
That I put down in words,
    Re/Fa#      Sol6            Sol             La   La4 – La 
How wonderful life is while you're in the world



Sim                     Sim/La     
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
Sim/Sol#             Sol6 
That I put down in words,
    Re/Fa#      Sol6       Sol            
How wonderful life is while you're in the world</pre>]
