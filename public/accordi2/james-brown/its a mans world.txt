You see, man made the cars

To take us over the road

Man made the train
             La#7        Re#m
To carry the heavy load
             La#m          Re#m
Man made the electrolight
                       La#7  Re#m
To take us out of the dark
                          La#7   Re#m
Man made the boat for the water

Man make them happy
                   La#7    Re#m
'Cause man make them toys

And after man make everything

La#7               Re#m   La#7
 To buy from other man

       La#7
But it would be nothing, nothing

Not one little thing
          Re#m             La#m  Re#m  La#m
