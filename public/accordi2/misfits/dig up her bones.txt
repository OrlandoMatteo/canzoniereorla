La#m Fa#     Sol#      La#m
  Anything is what she is
     Fa#     Sol#         La#m
  Anywhere is where she's from
     Fa#     Sol#         La#m
  Anything is what she'll be
     Fa#     Sol#          La#m
  Anything as long as it's mine
        Fa#     Sol#       La#m Sol#  La#m
And the door, it opens the way  back in
Fa#  Sol#       La#m Sol# La#m
      Or is it the  way back out?

Lies and secrets become your world
             Fa#             Sol# La#m
Any time, anywhere, she takes me away
Fa#         Sol#           La#m  Sol# La#m
   And death climbs up the steps one by one
   Fa#         Sol#              La#m   Sol# La#m
To give you the rose That's been burnt by her sun

La#m     Fa#   Do#  Sol#
Point me to the sky above
La#m    Fa#      Do#   Sol#
I can't get there on my own
La#m    Fa#   Do#      Sol#
Walk me to the graveyard
       La#m  Fa#          Do#     Sol#
Dig up her bo- oah-oah-oah-oah-oah-oah-

  I have heard of her death place
                  Fa#     Sol#      La#m
I fall down on my knees in praise of the
         Fa#         Sol#      La#m
Horrible things that took her away
Fa#         Sol#           La#m  Sol# La#m
   And death climbs up the steps one by one
   Fa#         Sol#              La#m  Sol# La#m
