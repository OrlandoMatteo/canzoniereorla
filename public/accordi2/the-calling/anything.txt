I will be there
        Sol#
Always waiting
            Re#
Waiting for you
           Sol#
To let me inside
                Re#
Where your fire burns
               Sol#
In a city of angels
            Dom           La#               Sol#
Just like a river rushing straight into the sea
        Dom                 La#             Sol#
I'm the one thing meant for you and you for me

             Re#
Whatever you want
             Sol#
Whatever you need
            Dom         La#   Sol#
Whatever it takes, I'll do anything

           Re#
And as you sleep
            Sol#
Eyes to the window
                 Re#
I'm watching you dream
                       Sol#
Well are you dreaming of me?
             Re#
So why can't you see
                Sol#
You're all that matters
                 Dom
You know if this earth should crack
     La#           Sol#
I'll be your solid ground
          Dom                La#           Sol#
I will be there to catch you when you fall down

             Re#
Whatever you want
             Sol#
Whatever you need
            Dom         La#   Sol#
Whatever it takes, I'll do anything
             Re#
If I have to crawl
               Sol#
Get down on my knees
            Dom          La#   Sol#
Whatever it takes, I'll do anything

Sol#add9 La#                  Dom
    I'd take the stars right out of the sky for you
Sol#add9 La#                Dom
    I'd end the world give you the sun, the moon
    Sol#            La#           Re#
For all of time, forever loving you
