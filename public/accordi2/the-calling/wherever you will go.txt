[<pre>Do        Sol                Lam           Fa                Do
So lately you're wondering who will be there to take my place
Do            Sol                Lam            Fa                Do
When I'm gone you'll need love to light the shadows on your face
Do      Sol               Lam       Fa           Do
If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all
Do        Sol              Lam             Fa                   Do
Then between sand and stone could you make it on your own?


Do         Sol            Lam           Fa              Do
If I could then I would I'll go wherever you will go
           Sol           Lam           Fa              Do
Way up high or down low I'll go wherever you will go

[Verse Two] (play intro until 3rd line)
Do        Sol             Lam        Fa                 Do
And maybe I'll find out a way to make it back someday
Do           Sol            Lam           Fa                Do
To watch you to guide you through the darkest of your days
Do    Sol                Lam       Fa             Do
If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all
Do            Sol                    Lam                Fa              Do
Well, then I hope there's someone out there who can bring me back to you


Do         Sol            Lam           Fa              Do
If I could then I would I'll go wherever you will go
           Sol           Lam           Fa             Lam
Way up high or down low I'll go wherever you will go


Lam    Fa                Sol
     Run away with my heart
Mim               Lam
Run away with my hope
Fa                Sol        Mim
Run away with my love

[Verse Three] (play intro until second F)
Do           Sol
  I know now just quite how
Lam             Fa                   Do
  My life and love might still go on
             Sol
In your heart in your mind
Lam                Fa              Do
  I'll stay with you for all of time


Do         Sol            Lam           Fa              Do
If I could then I would I'll go wherever you will go
           Sol           Lam           Fa              Do
Way up high or down low I'll go wherever you will go
           Sol         Lam               Fa              Do
If I could turn back time I'll go wherever you will go
           Sol         Lam               Fa              Do
If I could make you mine, I'll go wherever you will goooooooooooo
Sol        Lam             Fa              Do    Sol    Lam    Fa Fa Fa
oooooooo    I'll go wherever you will gooooooooo</pre>]
