This is the greatest and best song in the world...   Tribute.

Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here,
Lam
We was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road.
Lam
All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon...
Lam
In the middle of the road.
Lam
And he said:


La5 
"Play the best song in the world, or I'll eat your souls."


Lam
Well me and Kyle, we looked at each other,
Lam
And we each said...   "Okay"

Lam                                 Sol
And we played the first thing that came to our heads,
Fa                                   
Just so happened to be,
Lam                   Sol             Fa
The Best Song in the World, it was The Best Song in the World.


Re                          Fa
Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
        Do                     Sol
One and one make two, two and one make three,
        Fa
It was destiny.
Re                           Fa
Once every hundred-thousand years or so,
         Do                      Sol
When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow
         Fa
And the grass don't grow...


Lam
Needless to say, the beast was stunned.
Lam
Whip-crack went his schwumpy tail,
Lam
And the beast was done.
Lam
He asked us: "Be you angels?"
Lam
And we said, "Nay. We are but men!" ROCK!


Re     Fa     Do       Sol
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh-ah-ah,
Fa
Ohhh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh!


Lam               Sol                   Lam
This is not The Greatest Song in the World.
Lam                 Sol        Lam
No, this is just a tribute.
Lam                    Sol                    Lam
Couldn't remember The Greatest Song in the World.
Lam            Sol        Lam
No, this is a tribute, oh.

Lam Sol               Re           Fa
   To The Greatest Song in the World, All right!
Lam Sol                   Re           Fa
   It was The Greatest Song in the World, All right!
Lam         Sol
It was the best muthafuckin' song
Re                        Fa
The greatest song in the world.

And the peculiar thing is this my friends:
Re                        Fa
The song we sang on that fateful night,
Lam                       Sol                  Re      Fa
It didn't actually sound anything like this song.


               Lam           Sol           Re      Fa
This is just a tribute! You gotta' believe me!
                    Lam      Sol                 Re      Fa
And I wish you were there! Just a matter of opinion.
          Lam        Sol
Ah, fuck! Good God, God lovin',
Re                    Fa
So surprised to find you can't stop it.
Lam                   Sol   
Oh hallelujah, I'm found
 Re                   Fa
Rich motherfucker, ka-chug!


Mi      Fa       Mi         Fa
          All right! 
Mi      Fa       Mi         Fa
