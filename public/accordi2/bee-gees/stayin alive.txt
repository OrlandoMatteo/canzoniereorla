Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk,
      Re#             Fam7
I'm a woman's man: no time to talk

Music loud and women warm,
          Re#                 Fam7
I've been kicked around since I was born
             La#
And now it's all right It's OK

And you may look the other way

We can try to understand

The New York Times' effect on man

Fam7
Whether you're a brother

Or whether you're a mother,

You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive

Feel the city breakin'

And everybody shakin',

And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive

Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
                            Re#/Fa  Fam  Dom7  Fam7
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive...

      Fam7
Well, now, I get low and I get high,
         Re#                 Fam7
And if I can't get either, I really try

Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
      Re#               Fam7
I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose
              La#
You know it's all right It's OK

I'll live to see another day

We can try to understand

The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a brother

Or whether you're a mother,
Fam7
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive

Feel the city breakin'

And everybody shakin',

And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive

Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
                            Re#/Fa  Fam  Dom7
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive...

                   Fam7   La#
Somebody help me, yeah

Life goin' nowhere Somebody help me, yeah
         Fam7
Stayin' alive
