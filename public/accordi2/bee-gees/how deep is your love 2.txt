             Re          Fa#m7    Sol6
I know your eyes in the morning sun
Si7         Mim7             Fa#7      La7
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
        Re               Fa#m7   Sim7
And the moment that you wander far from me
        Mim7                   La7
I wanna feel you in my arms again


         Solmaj7           Fa#m7
Then you come to me on a summer breeze
        Mim7                         Do9
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
         Fa#m7               Sol/La
And it's me you need to show

I believe in you
Si7            Mim7       Fa#7   La7
You know the door to my very soul
            Re           Fa#m7    Sim7
You're the light in my deepest darkest hour
           Mim7             La7
You're my saviour when I fall
        Solmaj7           Fa#m7
And you may not think I care for you
         Mim7                      Do9
When you know down inside that I really do
        Fa#m7             Sol/La                        
And it's me you need to show,
