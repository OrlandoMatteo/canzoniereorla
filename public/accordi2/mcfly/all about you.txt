[<pre>Do         Lam        Rem         Sol                                    
it's all about you, it's all about you baby.
Do         Lam        Rem         Sol                  
it's all about you, it's all about you.

Do              Mi                    Lam
Yesterday, you asked me something I thought you knew
     Fa               Sol                     Do      Sol
So I told you with a smile 'It's all about you'
Do                  Mi                 Lam
Then you whispered in my ear and you told me too
       Fa                      Sol                    Do  Do7
Said, 'You make my life worthwhile, it's all about you'



    Fa              Fam
And I would answer all your wishes
Do      Sol        Lam
If you asked me to
       Re7
But if you deny me one of your kisses
Sol
Don't know what I'd do
Do                    Mi                         Lam
So hold me close and say three words, like you used to do
        Fa              Sol
Dancing on the kitchen tiles
               Do
It's all about you
Sol
Yeah...


Do   Mi    Lam    Lam     Fa     Sol     Do    Do7     


    Fa              Fam
And I would answer all your wishes
Do      Sol        Lam
If you asked me to
       Re7
But if you deny me one of your kisses
Sol
Don't know what I'd do
Do                    Mi                         Lam
So hold me close and say three words, like you used to do
        Fa              Sol
Dancing on the kitchen tiles
         Fa                 Sol
Yes, you make my life worthwhile
     Fa               Fam
So I told you with a smile
N.C
It's all about you


Do        Lam         Rem       Sol
It's all about you, It's all about you, baby
Do        Lam         Rem       Sol
It's all about you, It's all about you, baby
Do        Lam         Rem       Sol
It's all about you, It's all about you, baby
Do        Lam         Rem       Fam
It's all about you, It's all about you
N.C            Do
It's all about you</pre>]
