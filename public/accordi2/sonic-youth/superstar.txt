Long ago
      Do#         Dom
And oh so far away
          La#m           Do#
I fell in love with you
           Dom
Before the second show
Fam         Re#
Your guitar
          Do#            Dom
It sounds so sweet and clear
               La#m         Do#
But you're not really there
              Dom    Do
It's just the radio

Do#                    Dom         La#m    Sol#
Don't you remember you told me you love me baby
    Do#                  Dom       La#m    Sol#
You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
Do#       Dom  La#m  Sol#
Baby baby baby baby oh baby
  Fa#     Do#/Fa
I love you, I really do

Loneliness, is such a sad affair
          La#m        Do#
And I can hardly wait
           Dom
To be with you again
Fam          Re#
What to say
            Do#         Dom
To make you come again
             La#m     Do#
Come back to me again
              Dom         Do
And play your sad guitar

Do#                    Dom         La#m    Sol#
Don't you remember you told me you love me baby
    Do#                  Dom       La#m    Sol#
You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
Do#       Dom  La#m  Sol#
Baby baby baby baby oh baby
  Fa#     Sol#
I love you, I really do
Do#                    Dom         La#m    Sol#
Don't you remember you told me you love me baby
    Do#                  Dom       La#m    Sol#
You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
Do#       Dom  La#m  Sol#
Baby baby baby baby oh baby
  Fa#     Do#/Fa         Dom    Fam
I love you, I really do
