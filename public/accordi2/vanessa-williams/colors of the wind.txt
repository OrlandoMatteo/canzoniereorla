[<pre>     Do                               Lam
You think you own whatever land you land on
     Do                                 Mim
The earth is just a dead thing you can claim
    Lam                              Fa
But I know every rock and tree and creature
      Rem            Sol            Do
has a life, has a spirit, has a name
    Do                             Lam
You think the only people who are people
        Do                              Mim
are the people who look and think like you
    Lam                                Fa
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
               Rem               Sol          Do
you'll learn things you never knew you never knew


         Lam                              Mim        Fa
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
   Lam                                 Mim
or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned
         Fa                 Sol             Lam
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain
         Fa                                Sol
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind
         Fa                  Sol             Do
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind


     Do                                Lam
Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
     Do                                 Mim
Come taste the sun sweet berries of the earth
    Lam                              Fa
Come roll in all the riches all around you
      Rem            Sol           Do
and for once never wonder what they're worth
     Do                                Lam
The rain storm and the river are my brothers
     Do                                Mim
The heron and the otter are my friends
    Lam                              Fa
And we are all connected to each other
      Rem            Sol           Do
in a circle in a hoop that never ends


Do    Fa            Mim        Lam
How high does the sycamore grow?
       Rem                       Sol
If you cut it down then you'll never know


         Lam                              Mim        Fa
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
    Lam                              Mim
For whether we are white- or copper-skinned
         Fa                 Sol             Lam
You need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
         Fa                                Sol
You need to paint with all the colors of the wind
         Lam                              Mim
You can own the earth and still all you own is earth until
         Fa                  Sol             Do
you can paint with all the colors of the wind</pre>]
