Sim        Sim9
High tide, mid afternoon
  La7sus4       Solm/La# Sim
People fly by,  in the traffics boom
                    Sim9
Knowing, just where you are blowing
La7sus4          Solm/La#        Sim
Getting to where you should be going

Sim           Sim9
Don't let them get you down
La7sus4         Solm/La# Sim
Making you feel        guilty about
                         Sim9
Golden rain, will bring you riches
La7sus4             Solm/La# Sim
All the good things       you deserve and now

Sim  Sim9  La7sus4 Solm/La# Sim

Sim            Sim9
Climbing, forever trying
La7sus4          Solm/La#  Sim
Find your way out of the wild, wild wood
              Sim9
Now there's no justice
  La7sus4     Solm/La#       Sim
Only yourself that you can trust in
                      Sim9
And I said high tide, mid afternoon
La7sus4        Solm/La# Sim
People fly by, in the traffics boom
                     Sim9
Knowing, just where you are blowing
La7sus4          Solm/La#        Sim
Getting to where you should be going

Sim   Sim9   La7sus4 Solm/La# Sim

Sim             Sim9
Day by day your world fades away
La7sus4         Solm/La#  Sim
Waiting to feel all the dreams that say
                        Sim9
Golden rain will bring you riches
La7sus4            Solm/La# Sim
All the good things      you deserve now
                          Sim9
And I say, climbing, forever trying
La7sus4          Solm/La#   Sim
Find you way out   of the wild, wild wood
             La7sus4               Solm/La#
Said you are gonna find you way
           Sim
out of the wild, wild wood

Wild wild wood
