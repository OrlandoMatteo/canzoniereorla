You do something to me
Sim7            Mim
Something deep inside
                   Re    Lam7
I'm hanging on the wire
    Sim7          Mim
For love I'll never find
                Re         Lam7
You do something wonderful
Sim7          Mim
Chase it all away
           Re      Lam7
Mixing my emotions
 Sim7           Mim
Throws me back again

Hanging on the wire, yeah
    Re             Mim    Re#5 Re5 Do#5 Do7
I'm waiting for my change
                        Sol
I'm dancing through the fire
        La7
Just to catch a flame
     Do7          Mim
Feel real again
