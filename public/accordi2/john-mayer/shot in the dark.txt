It's a hard run
Mim             Re
Loving like we do
      Mim      Sim        La      Sol
Takes way too long to get over you
     Re         Mim        Re
And remember the line we drew
    Mim      Sim       La          Sol
But call me over and I'm coming through

Sol                         La     Sim
  We're searching for the night together
Sol          La           Sim
  Where we don't fall apart
Sol                    La         Sim
  Might be now and it might be never
Sol                    La          Re
  It's just another shot in the dark
Sol                    La          Re

      Re      Mim          Re
And I wonder what it all means
Mim            Sim          La         Sol
Strange conversation with you in my dreams
      Re          Mim             Re
And I don't know what I'm gonna do
           Mim          Sim             La       Sol
I've loved seven other women and they all were you

Sol                 La     Sim
  We had a run of bad romances
Sol             La          Sim
  They always missed the mark
Sol                            La         Sim
  So close your eyes now and take your chances
Sol                    La          Re
  It's just another shot in the dark
Sol                    La          Re

I want you in the worst way
       Sim                   La         Sol
Is the gate code still your birthday?

Sol                             La   Sim
  If you thought you met your Casanova
Sol                        La      Sim
  And he left you with a broken heart
Sol                    La        Sim
  Remember when it's done and over
Sol                    La           Re
  It was only just a shot in the dark
Sol                    La           Re
  It was only just a shot in the dark
Sol                   La           Re
  It's just another shot in the dark
Sol                   La            Re
