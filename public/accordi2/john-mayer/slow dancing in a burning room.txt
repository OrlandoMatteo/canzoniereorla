It's not a silly little moment
             Fa                Do
It's not the storm before the calm
            Lam
This is the deep and dyin breath of
                     Fa       Do
This love we've been workin on
              Lam
Can't seem to hold you like I want to
         Fa              Do
So I can feel you in my arms
         Lam
Nobody's gonna come and save you
                   Fa        Do
We pulled too many false alarms


        Sol
We're goin down
            Lam      Fa
And you can see it too
        Sol
We're goin down
        Lam              Fa
And you know that we're doomed
       Lam                       Fa      Do
My dear we're slow dancing in a burnin room

I was the one you always dreamed of
             Fa              Do
You were the one I tried to draw
             Lam
How dare you say it's nothing to me
                      Fa            Do
Baby, you're the only light I ever saw
              Lam
I'll make the most of all the sadness
            Fa                 Do
You'll be a bitch because you can
           Lam
You try to hit me just to hurt me
Lam
So you leave me feeling dirty
          Fa          Do
Cauz you can't understand


               Sol
We're goin down
            Lam        Fa
And you can see it too
               Sol
We're goin down
        Lam              Fa
And you know that we're doomed
     Lam                         Fa      Do
My dear we're slow dancing in a burnin room
