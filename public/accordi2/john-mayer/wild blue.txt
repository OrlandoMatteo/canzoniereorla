[<pre>Lam Do Fa Rem x2

Lam               Do
Never seen the sun before
Fa            Rem
Lying on the ocean floor
Lam                       Do
I'm walking through the wilderness
Fa                  Rem
And living off the loneliness

   Sol        Do               Fa
Oh wild blue, deeper than I ever knew
Sol        Do            Fa
Wild blue on a bed of grey
                Sol        Do
Oh baby, what a wild blue
                    Fa
I found myself when I lost you

Lam               Do
All the tears I meant to cry
Fa                Rem
Dance across the evening sky
Lam               Do
And in my sorrow I can see
Fa                  Rem
That missing you belongs to me

   Sol        Do               Fa
Oh wild blue, deeper than I ever knew
Sol        Do            Fa
Wild blue on a bed of grey
                Sol        Do
Oh baby, what a wild blue
                    Fa
I found myself when I lost you

   Sol        Do               Fa
Oh wild blue, deeper than I ever knew
Sol        Do            Fa
Wild blue since you went away
                Sol        Do
Oh baby, what a wild blue
                    Fa
I found myself when I lost you

Sol Lam
     Sol           Lam
And you'll never know
    Sol         Lam       Rem
The unlikely beauty in letting you go
