[<pre>Re La4 Sol La4 (2x)


Re   La4    Sol        La4
We got the afternoon
Re   La4      Sol          La4
You got this room for two
Re     La4     Sol          La4
One thing I've left to do
    Re 
Discover me
    La4     Sol   La4 
Discovering you


Re   La4     Sol     La4
One mile to every inch of
Re     La4     Sol      La4 
Your skin like porcelain
Re    La4   Sol   La4 
One pair of candy lips and
           Re               La4   Sol   La4
Your bubblegum tongue


            Sol
And if you want love
       La4 
We'll make it
            Sol
Swimming a deep sea
     La4 
Of blankets
               Sol 
Take all your big plans
     La4
And break 'em
          Mim    Fa#m     Sol
This is bound to be a while


     La4       Re        La4   Sol
Your body Is a wonderland
    La4        Re    
Your body is a wonder
    La4     Sol
(I'll use my hands)
     La4       Re             La4   Sol   La4 
Your body Is a wonderland   


Re          La4    Soladd9  La4
Something 'bout the way your hair falls in your face
Re          La4    Soladd9  La4
I love the shape you take when crawling towards the pillowcase
Re          La4    Soladd9  La4
You tell me where to go and,though I might leave to find it
Re          La4    Soladd9  La4
I'll never let your head hit the bed without my hand behind it


            Sol
And if you want love
      La4 
We'll make it
            Sol
Swimming a deep sea
     La4 
Of blankets
               Sol
Take all your big plans
     La4
And break 'em
          Mim     Fa#m    Sol
This is bound to be a while

     Damn baby, you frustrate me
Sim9                               Sim9         
    I know you're mine all mine all mine
                                   
But you look so good it hurts sometimes
