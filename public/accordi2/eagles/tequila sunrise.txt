        Lam  Re  Sol

Sol
 It's another tequila sunrise
Re                        Lam
 Starin' slowly cross the sky
Re7         Sol
  Said good bye

He was just a hired hand
Re                                Lam
 Workin' on a dream he planned to try
Re7           Sol
  the days go by

Mim                   Do
 Every night when the sun goes down
Mim           Do              Mim
 just another lonely boy in town
    Lam               Re7
and she's out runnin' round

Sol
 She wasnt just another woman
Re                              Lam
 And I couldnt keep from comin' on
Re7            Sol
  It's been so long

Oh and it's a hollow feelin'
Re                             Lam
 When it comes down to dealin' friends
Re7        Sol
  It never ends

Sol   Re   Lam7  Re7  Sol

Lam            Re
  Take another shot of courage
Sim              Mi7               Lam7  Si
  Wonder why the right words never come
             Mim7   La
You just get numb

Sol
 It's another tequila sunrise
Re                              Lam
 This old world still looks the same
Re7       Sol
  Another frame
