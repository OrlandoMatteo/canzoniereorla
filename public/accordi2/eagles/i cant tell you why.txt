Look at us baby, up all night
Solmaj7
Tearing our love apart
Remaj7
Aren't we the same two people
                  Solmaj7              Fa#7sus4 Fa#7
Who lived through years in the dark?
Sim                  La/Si      Solmaj7
 Every time I try to walk away
                         Fa#7sus4       Fa#7
Something makes me turn around and stay
     Sim             La/Si   Solmaj7  Fa#m7
And I can't tell you why

Remaj7
When we get crazy

It just ain't right

(try to keep your head, little girl)
Solmaj7
Girl, I get lonely, too
   Remaj7
You don't have to worry

Just hold on tight

(don't get caught in your little world)
Solmaj7          Fa#7sus4   Fa#7
   ...'Cause I love you

Sim                        La/Si     Solmaj7
 Nothing's wrong as far as I can see
                          Fa#7sus4    Fa#7
We make it harder than it has to be
     Sim             La/Si
And I can't tell you why
          Solmaj7             Fa#m7 Fa#7
No, baby, I can't tell you why
Solmaj7            Fa#m7
I can't tell you why
