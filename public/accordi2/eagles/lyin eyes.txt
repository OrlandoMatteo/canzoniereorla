Sol               Solmaj7            Do
City girls just seem to find out early,
Lam                            Re7
how to open doors with just a smile.
  Sol                Solmaj7             Do
A rich old man and she won't have to worry;
       Lam              Do              Sol
she'll dress up all in lace and go in style.

Sol               Solmaj7              Do
Late at night a big old house gets lonely;
  Lam                                 Re7
I guess every form of refuge has its price.
       Sol                   Solmaj7             Do
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
      Lam            Do                Sol    Do  Re
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice.

       Sol                  Solmaj7          Do
So she tells him she must go out for the evening
    Lam                                 Re7
To comfort an old friend who's feeling down.
    Sol                    Solmaj7          Do
But he knows where she's goin' as she's leavin';
      Lam             Do                Sol     Do  Sol
She's headed for the cheatin' side of town.


          Sol    Do              Sol     Do  Sol        
You can't hi-  ide your lyin' eyes,       
Mim   Sim          Lam                Re
and your smi - ile is a thin disguise.
             Sol    Fa/Sol              Do    La7      
I thought by no - ow     you'd rea-li - ize 
      Lam               Re               Sol
there ain't no way to hide your lying eyes.

       Sol             Solmaj7         Do
On the other side of town a boy is waiting
     Lam                                 Re7
with fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal
    Sol                     Solmaj7         Do
She drives on through the night, antici-pating
       Lam                 Do               Sol      Do  Re
Cos he makes her feel the way she used to feel

    Sol             Solmaj7              Do
She rushes to his arms, they fall to-gether
    Lam                            Re7
She whispers that it's only for a while
    Sol                          Solmaj7           Do
She swears that soon she'll be coming back for-ever
    Lam             Do                 Sol
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile


          Sol    Do              Sol     Do  Sol          
You can't hi-  ide your lyin' eyes,      
Mim   Sim                 Lam    Re
and your smi-i-ile is a thin disguise.
             Sol    Fa/Sol              Do    La7 
I thought by no - ow     you'd rea-li - 
           Lam              Re                Sol
ize there ain't no way to hide your lying eyes.

(Sol) Solmaj7  Do    Lam  Re7  Sol


Sol               Solmaj7           Do
She gets up and pours herself a strong one
    Lam                                Re7
And stares out at the stars up in the sky.
 Sol                  Solmaj7      Do
Another night, it's gonna be a long one;
    Lam                  Do                 Sol     Do  Re
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry.

    Sol              Solmaj7         Do
She wonders how it ever got this crazy
    Lam                             Re7
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
    Sol                Solmaj7            Do
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy
      Lam               Do                 Sol
She's so far gone, she feels just like a fool

Sol              Solmaj7               Do
My, oh my, you sure know how to ar-range things;
    Lam                            Re7
You set it up so well, so careful-ly.
         Sol              Solmaj7           Do
Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things;
       Lam                 Do                Sol     Do  Sol
You're still the same old girl you used to be.

    
          Sol    Do              Sol     Do  Sol        
You can't hi-  ide your lyin' eyes,      
 Mim           Sim          Lam           Re
and your smi-i- ile is a thin dis-guise.
             Sol    Fa/Sol              Do    La7      
I thought by no - ow     you'd rea-li - 
            Lam             Re                Sol
ize there ain't no way to hide your lying eyes.
Solmaj7       Lam              Re               Sol
      There ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes
Solmaj7  Lam               Re               Sol
       Honey, you can't hide your lyin' eyes.
