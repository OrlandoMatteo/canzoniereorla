  On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Sol                      Re
  Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
Fa                          Do
  Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
Rem
   My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
Mi
  I had to stop for the night

Lam                               Mi7
  There she stood in the doorway; I heard the mission bell
Sol
  And I was thinking to myself
              Re
This could be heaven or this could be hell
Fa                          Do
  Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way
Rem
   There were voices down the corridor,
Mi
  I thought I heard them say...


Fa                          Do
  Welcome to the Hotel California.
       Mi7                                          Lam
Such a lovely place, (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
Fa                               Do
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
    Rem                                       Mi
Any time of year, (any time of year) You can find it here


Lam                            Mi7
 Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, She got the Mercedes bends
Sol                                    Re
 She got a lot of pretty pretty boys   she calls friends
Fa                                   Do
  How they danced in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Rem                       Mi
  Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

Lam                           Mi7
  So I called up the captain; Please bring me my wine (he said)
Sol                                     Re
 We haven't had that spirit here since 1969
Fa                                         Do
  and still those voices are calling from far away
Rem
   Wake you up in the middle of the night
Mi
  Just to hear them say...


Fa                         Do
 Welcome to the Hotel California.
       Mi7                                          Lam
Such a lovely place, (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
        Fa                             Do
They're livin' it up at the Hotel California
       Rem                                               Mi
What a nice surprise, (what a nice surprise) Bring your alibis


Lam                        Mi7
   Mirrors on the ceiling; the pink champagne on ice (and she said)
Sol                                Re
  We are all just prisoners here, of our own device
Fa                              Do
  and in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
Rem
 They stab it with their steely knives but they
Mi
just can't kill the beast

Lam                             Mi7
   Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
Sol                                       Re
  I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
Fa                                   Do
  "Relax" said the night man; we are programmed to receive
