     Sol Sol7            Do           Dom6
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses ?
         Sol        Mim        La7     Re
You been out ridin' fences for so long now
             Sol     Fa/Sol        Do                 Dom
Oh, you're a hard one, I know that you got your reasons,
      Sol/Re      Si/Re# Mim7           La7      Re7   Sol  Re/Fa#
These things that are  pleasin' you can hurt you somehow
          Mim               Sim7
Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy,
       Do                  Sol  Sol/Fa#
She'll beat you if she's able,
             Mim                  Do             Sol  Re/Fa#
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
       Mim7              Sim7                 Do             Sol
Now it seems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table
        Mim7          La7            Do/Re
But you only want the ones you can't get

Re7  Sol  Fa/Sol        Do
Desperado, oh you ain't gettin' no younger,
     Sol      Si/Fa# Mim            La7         Re7
Your pain and your  hunger, they're drivin' you home
    Sol     Fa/Sol             Do
And freedom, well, that's just some people talkin'
     Sol    Si/Fa# Mim                La7    Re7  Sol  Re/Fa#
Your prison is   walkin' through this world all alone

           Mim                  Sim7
Don't your feet get cold in the winter time
    Do                     Sol        Sol/Fa#
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
     Mim7             Do                  Sol  Re/Fa#
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
       Mim7            Sim7
You're losin' all your highs and lows
         Do            Sol           Lam7  Do6/Re
Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away

Re7  Sol Fa/La Sol/Si    Do           Dom
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
     Sol        Re/Fa# Mim7  La7        RA7
Come down from your   fences, open the gate
          Sol    Fa/La Sol/Si    Do             Dom6
It may be rainin', but there's a rainbow above you
           Sol     Si/Fa# Mim       Do  Sol/Si  Lam7
You better let somebody   love you...
           Sol/Re  Si/Re# Mim
You better let somebody  love you
