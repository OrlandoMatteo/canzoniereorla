    I like the way your sparkling earrings lay
Re            Sol         La7
Against your skin so brown
Re          Sol                 Re            Sol
And I want to sleep with you in the desert tonight
Re              Sol         La7
With a billion stars all around


La7            Sol             Re
Cause I got a peaceful easy feeling
Sol                           Mim     La7
And I know you won't let me down
          Re     Mim    Sol        La7      Re      
Cause I'm allll-ready standing   on the ground

Re           Sol          Re     Sol
And I found out a long time ago
Re                Sol          La7
What a woman can do to your soul
Re       Sol                  Re   Sol
Ah, but she can't take you any way
Re                 Sol           La7
You don't already know how to go

Re         Sol             Re    Sol
I get the feeling I may know you
Re    Sol            La7
As a lover and a friend
Re                Sol          Re         Sol
This voice keeps whispering in my other ear
         Re           Sol       La7
Tells me I may never see you again
