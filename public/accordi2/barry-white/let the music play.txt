Let the music play
             Rem7                 Solm7
I just wanna dance the night away

Here, right here, right here is where I'm gonna stay
    La#maj7          Rem7  Sol9
All night long...
Re#maj7
Let the music play on
             Rem7                     Solm7
Just until I feel this misery is gone
                           Dom7
Movin', kickin', groovin', keep the music strong
   La#maj7                       Solm7
On and on, and on, and on, and on,

and on, and on, and on, and on,
                    Re#/Fa
and on, and on, and on, and on, and on

I can't erase the things I feel
Dom9                   Re#/Fa    Re/Fa# Solm
 The tender love we used to share
   Dom9                     Re#/Fa   Re/Fa# Solm
See, it's like it's no longer there
Dom9                   Re#/Fa   Fa
 I've got to hide what's killin' me inside

 I think I'm gonna be alright, ha, ha, ha
Dom9                    Re#/Fa     Re/Fa# Solm
 If I can make it through the night, oh, Lord
Dom9                   Re#/Fa        Re/Fa# Solm
 I'll just pretend she's here with me
Dom9                             Re#/Fa  Re/Fa# Solm
 I'll close my eyes, her face I'll see
  Dom9                               Re#/Fa
I know it's make believe, but it's the only hope for me
