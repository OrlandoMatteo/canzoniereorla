 I've heard people say that
Lam7
 Too much of anything is not good for you, baby
La#maj7
 Oh no
                         Lam7
But I don't know about that
                                    La#maj7
There's many times that we've loved
                                Lam7
We've shared love and made love
                                      La#maj7
It doesn't seem to me like it's enough
                               La#/Do
There's just not enough of it

There's just not enough

Oh oh, babe

Oh babe

   Famaj7         Solm7
My darling I
La#/Do              Famaj7             Solm7 La#/Do
Can't get enough of your love, babe
        Famaj7                          Solm7
Girl, I don't know, I don't know why
La#/Do              Famaj7             Solm7  La#/Do
Can't get enough of your love, babe
          Famaj7                       Solm7
Lord some things I can't get used to
   La#/Do       Famaj7    Solm7  La#/Do
No matter how I try
              Famaj7                           Solm7
It's like the more you give, the more I want
    La#/Do          Famaj7
And baby, that's no lie
   Solm7    La#/Do
Oh no, babe

       La#maj7
Tell me, what can I say? What am I gonna do?
Lam7                    Rem7               La#maj7
 How should I feel when everything is you?

What kind of love is this that you're givin' me?
Lam7                   Rem7
 Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet?
La#maj7
 Girl, all I know is every time you're near
La#/Do
  I feel the change

Somethin' moves

I scream your name

Look what you got me doin'

   Famaj7         Solm7
My darling I
La#/Do              Famaj7             Solm7 La#/Do
Can't get enough of your love, babe
        Famaj7                          Solm7
Girl, I don't know, I don't know why
La#/Do              Famaj7             Solm7  La#/Do
Can't get enough of your love, babe
         Famaj7                       Solm7
Girl, if I could only make you see
    La#/Do         Famaj7    Solm7  La#/Do
And make you understand
           Famaj7                       Solm7
Girl, your love for me is all I need
    La#/Do
And more than I can stand
   Solm7       La#/Do
Oh well, babe

La#maj7
 How can I explain all the things I feel?
Lam7                      Rem7
 You've given me so much, girl you're so unreal
     La#maj7
Still, I keep loving you more and more each time
Lam7                        Rem7
 Girl, what am I gonna do because you've blown my mind
La#maj7
 I get the same old feelin' every time you're here
La#/Do
  I feel the change

Somethin' moves

I scream your name

Look what you got me doin'

   Famaj7         Solm7
My darling I
La#/Do              Famaj7             Solm7 La#/Do
Can't get enough of your love, babe

La#maj7   Lam7   La#maj7   Lam7

Solm7 La#/Do Solm7 La#/Do Solm11 La#/Do

   Famaj7         Solm7
My darling I
La#/Do              Famaj7             Solm7 La#/Do
Can't get enough of your love, babe
        Famaj7                          Solm7
Girl, I don't know, I don't know why
La#/Do              Famaj7             Solm7  La#/Do
Can't get enough of your love, babe...
