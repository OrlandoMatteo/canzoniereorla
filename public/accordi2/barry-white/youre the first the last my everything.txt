 We got it together didn't we...

...Nobody but you... and me
                            Do
We got it together, baby

     Fa         Famaj7     Rem
Ahh, the first, my last, my everything
  Famaj7           Fa7     La#     Fa/La
And the answer to all my dreams
Solm7          Do     Lam7         Rem   Sol7
You're my sun, my moon, my guiding star
                    La#m              Do7
My kind of wonderful, that's what you are
Fa      Famaj7              Rem
I know there's only, only one like you
Famaj7          Fa7               La#
There's no way, they could have made two
            La#m
You're all I'm living for,
Famaj7                      Re9
 Your love I'll keep for evermore,
       Sol7       Do7                 Fa
You're the first, you're the last, my everything

Fa      Famaj7      Rem
In you, I've found so many things
Famaj7           Fa7      La#          Fa/La
 A love so new only you could bring
Solm7           Do      Lam7
 Can't you see if you,
                  Rem       Sol7
You make me feel this way

You're like a first morning dew
La#m             Do7
  on a brand new day

Fa     Famaj7       Rem       Famaj7
  I see so many ways that I
                Fa7     La#
can love you, 'till the day I die
           La#m   Fa               Re9      Sol7
You're my reality, yet I'm lost in a dream
                 Do7           Fa
You're the first, the last, my everything

Fa   Famaj7  Dom7/Fa   La#   La#m   Fa   Re9

Sol7   Do7

Fa     Famaj7          Rem
I know there's only, only one like you
   Famaj7      Fa7               La#
There's no way they could have made two
                La#m     Fa
Girl you're my reality
                Re9       Sol7
But I'm lost in a dream
                 Do7               Fa
You're the first, you're the last, my everything
