[<pre>Fa          Lam
Sat on the rooftop 
Dom           La#
Watching the birds flying free
Fa            Lam
Watching the clouds walk
Dom                La#
And watching the rain become the sea
Fa          Lam
Hearing my love talk
Dom          La#         Do7
Every breath she ever breathes
           Dom                 La#
Like it was always supposed to be like that 

Fa - Lam - Dom - La# x2

Fa           Lam
But then we broke up
Dom            La#           
And she went west and I went east
Fa            Lam
She got a new boyfriend
Dom               La#
A little too soon if you're asking me
Fa                Lam
I heard that she loves him
Dom            La#                    Do7
A litte bit more than she'll ever love me
                 Dom          La#
And it was always supposed to be like that

Fa - Lam - Dom - La# x2

La#            Fa 
I look to the skyline
Dom                  Fa
And said how many falls until I fly
La#              Fa
Look to the old times and said
Dom            Fa         
How many wrongs until I'm right
La#           Fa
And oh it's tough now
Dom                                   La#
Cause love always, love always is unkind

Fa - Lam - Dom - La# x2

Fa             Lam  
I sat on the rooftop
Dom                     La#
And I watched the birds flying free
Fa             Lam
I watched the clouds walk
Dom                 La#
And I watched the rain become the sea
Fa               Lam     Dom           La#
And just for a moment, just for a moment
          Do7          Dom               La#
I felt so free from all I'm supposed to be

Fa - Lam - Dom - La# x2

La#            Fa 
I look to the skyline
Dom                  Fa
And said how many falls until I fly
La#              Fa
Look to the old times and said
Dom            Fa         
How many wrongs until I'm right
La#           Fa
And oh it's tough now
Dom                                   La#
Cause love always, love always is unkind</pre>]
