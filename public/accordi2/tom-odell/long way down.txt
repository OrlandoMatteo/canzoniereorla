Do              Mim
Walking on the rooftops
Lam         Fa
Talking of times
Do               Mim
With our eyes a glowing
Lam            Fa
Like the city lights
    Do             Mim
She stands on the ledge,
           Lam            Re7
She says, 'it looks so high'


You know it's a...

Do    Mim  Lam     Fa
Long way down
             Do    Mim  Lam      Fa
Feels like a long way down
             Do    Mim  Lam      Fa
Feels like a long way down
       Do    Mim  Lam      Fa
Like a long way down
         Mim
So honey don't leave, don't leave,
             Fa
Please don't leave me now

          Do        Mim
Cuz I can feel the rivers
        Lam          Fa
Winding through the lands
    Do            Mim
Two lines, and a poet (you know)
       Lam       Fa
Like a kind old rye
                  Do            Mim
You know we could talk in that language
        Lam     Re7
Only we understand


But you know..

       Do    Mim  Lam     Fa
It's a long way down
             Do    Mim  Lam      Fa
Feels like a long way down
             Do    Mim  Lam      Fa
Feels like a long way down
       Do    Mim  Lam      Fa
Like a long way down
         Mim
So honey don't leave, don't leave,
             Fa
Please don't leave me now</pre>]
