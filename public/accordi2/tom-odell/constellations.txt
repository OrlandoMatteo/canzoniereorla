Sol#                        La#m
Sat around the table, the candle lying low
        Re#                      
There's people all around us but 
         Dom
they're leaving you alone
       Sol#m                  
You're telling me a story, 
      La#m
some lover that you had
      Re#                        
Go on tell me now, tell me now, 
    Re#7
I think I'll understand

    Sol#                   La#m
The piano man is playing some old melody
   Re#                         
It don't mean much to anyone 
       DomÂ 
what it does to you and me
     Sol#                          
It's just some bitter love song 
     La#m
that everybody's heard
          Re#                       
I'm gonna sing it out, sing it out, 
       Re#7          Sol#
sing every single word

Sol#                 Do#              Re#
It's the same old constellation
                      Dom      Fam
The stars up in the sky
                  Do#
Yeah, I've got a feeling
                               Re# Re#7  Sol#
They're gonna look different tonight

Sol#                    La#m
Maybe I'm just crazy, maybe I'm just high
          Re#                               
You could kiss my lips a thousand times and 
Dom
they would never dry
  Sol#                                 
I don't know where you're going, hey, 
    La#m
never stray too far
           Re#                            
Cause I'll tell you now, I'll tell you now, 
            Re#7              Sol#
I like you just the way you are

Sol#                 Do#              Re#

Sol#                 Do#          Re#
It's the same old situation
                          Dom  Fam
That you can have with any guy
                         Do#
But go on put your arms around me
                          Re# Re#7  Sol#
It's gonna be different tonight

Do7                                    
Care a lot, care a lot, 
I used to act so strong
               Fam                    
But I was just terrified, terrified, 
             Fa
I feel it in my stomach
         Do#                           
Call 'em butterflies, butterflies, 
there's something in the air tonight
        Do#m Fa#          Do#m Fa#  Re#      Sol#
They're gone,   they're gone,   they're gone

But you know I've got a feeling

Sol#                 Do#             Re#
It's the same old conversation
                   Dom       Fam
You can have it anytime
                     Do#
Go on put your arms around me, baby
                          Re# Re#7  Sol#
