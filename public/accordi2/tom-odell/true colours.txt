Mim Re Sol Do Re Sol Do Re Sol

Do            Sol   Re
You with the sad eyes
Sol
Don't be discouraged
Lam      Do
Oh I realize
Mim               Re
Its hard to take courage
       Sol           Lam
In a world full of people
             Do
You can lose sight of it all
Mim       Re
Darkness inside you
            Do        Sol
Can make you feel so small

Sol                   Do
But I see your true colours
Sol       Re
Shining through
                Do  Sol
I see your true colours
               Re
And that's why I love you
            Do      Sol         Lam
So don't be afraid to let them show
Mim    Do     Sol
Your true colours
 Do    Sol
True colours
Re
Beautiful

Do Re Sol Do Mim Re Do

Do           Mim
Show me a smile then
Re        Sol
Don't be unhappy
      Do
Can't remember when
Mim             Re
I last saw you laughing
Sol                   Lam
If this world makes you crazy
    Do
And you've taken all you can bear
Mim       Re
You call me up
        Do                   Sol
Because you know I'll be there

Sol                   Do
But I see your true colours
Sol       Re
Shining through
                Do  Sol
I see your true colours
               Re
And that's why I love you
            Do      Sol         Lam
So don't be afraid to let them show
Mim    Do     Sol
Your true colours
 Do    Sol          Re
True colours are Beautiful</pre>]
