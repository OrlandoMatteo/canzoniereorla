[<pre>Do  Rem  Mim    Fa   Do Rem

Do             Rem             Mim
I'm sick to death of eating breakfast on my own
Fa        Do            Rem
Starting out my daily blues
(Hmmm)
Do             Rem             Mim
I'm sick to death of spilling coffee on my phone
(Oooh)
Fa             Do             Rem
Scrolling through pictures of you
Fa            Sol             Do
I'd like to say that maybe we could work it out
Fa            Sol             Do
But I know that it's no use


Rem                Sol    Do       Do/Si    Lam
If I ever find anyone half as good as you
Rem       Sol              Do
I think maybe that will do
(Oooh)


Do             Rem              Mim
I kissed a stranger in the hallway late last night
Fa       Mim       Rem      Do
He was wearing purple shoes
Do             Rem               Mim
I asked him when he kissed me, could he close his 
eyes?
Fa           Mim             Rem
But he just looked at me confused
Fa           Sol              Do            Do7
And people say my expectations are too high
Fa           Sol              Do        Do7
But I'm not asking for the moon


Rem               Sol     Do       Do/Si    Lam
If I ever find anyone half as good as you
Rem         Sol            Lam
I think maybe that will do
Rem               Sol     Do       Do/Si    Lam
If I ever find anyone half as good as you
Rem         Sol             Do
I think maybe that will do


Rem                  Sol
Oh, I'm so sick of laying here
So sick of counting tears
Do           Mim/Si      Fa
Comparing everyone to you
Oh, oh
Rem                     Lam
Oh, I'm so sick of waiting here
So frustrated
     Mi
My suspicions are you're laying there 
and thinking of me too


Do             Rem          Mim
I learned the lyrics yesterday to all your songs
Fa         Mim          Rem
There was one I couldn't do
Do            Rem
I think the lyric went
Mim
"You'll miss me when I'm gone"
Fa         Mim          Rem
But the chords, I was confused
Fa               Sol                 Do
I'd ask you 'round and you could tell me where 
I'm wrong
Fa               Sol             Do     Do7
But then I know you'd just refuse
Refuse


Rem               Sol     Do       Do/Si    Lam
If I ever find anyone half as good as you
Rem         Sol            Lam
I think maybe that will do
Ooooh

Rem               Sol     Do       Do/Si    Lam
If I ever find anyone half as good as you
Rem         Sol            Do
I think maybe that will do</pre>]
