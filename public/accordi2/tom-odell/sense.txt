Re#           La#m
Hard to know,
            Sol#              Sol#m
Maybe if I'd skim the stone,
                 Solm           Dom7
Walk a different way back home,
                 Sol#      Sol#m
It would all make sense.

Or shut my eyes,
                     Sol#           Sol#m
Could lose myself in teenage lies.
                    Solm             Dom7
If I fell in love a thousand times,
                  Sol#    Sol#m
Would it all make sense?

      Solm         Sol#        
Cause I've, been feeling pretty small,
    Solm                 Sol#
Sometimes feel like I'm slipping down walls
          Solm     Dom7                  
And every line I ever get a hold 
     Fam       Fam/La#
it seems to break.

      Re#          La#m   
Could call you up
                 Sol#             Sol#m
I could tell you just how much,
                  Solm7           Dom7
No no, maybe I'll just get drunk
                    Sol#     Sol#m
And it will all make sense.
               Re#       La#m
Or if I weren't so nice,
                         Sol#          Sol#m
convince my friends that you weren't right
                       Solm7             Dom7
I could promise you my heart won't cry,
                     Sol#      Sol#m
but would it all make sense?
