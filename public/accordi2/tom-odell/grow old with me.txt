[<pre>Sol Do 

Sol              Do
I can feel you breathing
Sol              Do
With your hair on my skin
Sol              Do         Sol
As we lie here within the night

Sol              Do
I pull those sheets
Sol              Do
When its cold on your feet
Sol              Do                Sol
Cause you'll fall back to sleep everytime


Do             Re
Grow old with me
Do             Re
Let us share what we see
Do             Re
And all the best it could be
               Sol
Just you and I

Sol   Do  x2
Ohhhhhhh

Sol              Do
Our hands they might age
Sol              Do
And our bodies will change
Sol              Do                 Sol
But we'll still be the same, as we are
Sol              Do
We'll still sing our song
Sol              Do
When our hair ain't so blonde
Sol              Do                 Sol
And our children have sung we were right

Do             Re
Grow old with me
Do             Re
Let us share what we see
Do             Re
Oh the best it could be
               Sol
Just you and I 

Sol    Do   x2
(ooohhh)

Sol              Do
The hairs they stand up
Sol              Do
And my feet start to thump
Sol              Do            Sol
And the feeling is dreaming around
Sol              Do
You'll be the one
Sol              Do
Who makes me hurt, make me come
Sol              Do              Sol
Make me feel like I'm feeling alive

Do             Re
and all the best it could be
               Sol
Just you and I
Do             Re
Grow old with me
Do             Re
Let us share what we see
Do             Re
and all the best it could be
                Sol
Just you and I 

Sol   Do   x2
