Do          Mim                Sol    Sol4    Sol  
A coffee stain on a window sill
Do          Mim                Sol    Sol4    Sol  
A bad translation to a foreign film
Fa                 Lam
Or just wondering round with you
Fa                 Lam
Just wondering town with you
Fa       Do
Oh oh oh oh
        Sol    Sol4    Sol  
Would be enough

Do          Mim                Sol    Sol4    Sol  
The tiny cracks on the city stone
Do          Mim                Sol    Sol4    Sol  
A welcome back to your troubled home
Fa                 Lam
Or just wondering round with you
Fa                 Lam
Just wondering town with you
Fa       Do
Oh oh oh oh
        Sol    Sol4    Sol  
Would be enough

   Do    Sol   Rem   Do
But ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
   Sol               Do             Fa
I did not see the sea until I crossed
   Do    Sol   Rem   Do
    Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
   Sol               Do               Fa
And I didn't feel your love until I lost

Do          Mim                Sol    Sol4    Sol  
The moving shadows on your swaying light
Do          Mim                Sol    Sol4    Sol  
Or you picture notes of porcupines
Fa                 Lam
Or just wondering round with you
Fa                 Lam
Just wondering town with you
Fa       Do
Oh oh oh oh
        Sol    Sol4    Sol  
Would be enough

   Do    Sol   Rem   Do
But ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
