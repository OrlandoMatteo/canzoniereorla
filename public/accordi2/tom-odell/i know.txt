Fa#       La#m          Fa#
Cold house, white light
Fa#        La#m                 Si
Yellow lamps on blackened skies
Si              Do#              Si
Duffel hoods and deep brown eyes
Si              Do#                        Fa#

On the way you stand, on the way you sway
Fa#           La#m                 Si
The way your hair curls in the rain
Si          Do#                 Si
The little lines write your face
Si           Do#                    Fa#
So do winter nights you'd come and stay

Fa#             La#m                   Fa#
Or the way you hit me when you wanna fight
Fa#      La#m                Si
The way i yearn, the way i cry
Si       Do#                    Si
The way i love rose with the tides
Si           Do#                  Si
