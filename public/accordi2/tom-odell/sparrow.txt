Sol           Sim             La             Re
Why sparrow why, won't you tell me why I'm sad
Mim             Fa#7         Sim            Mi9  
Sing us both a melody, the best that you can
Sol           Sim             La          Re
Fly sparrow fly, won't you sit on my hand
Mim              Fa#7         Sim            Mi9   
Sing it in that language we both can understand
 
        Sol
When you sit on that tree
    Sim
You look in my eyes
Sol                  Sim
I wonder what goes on in your mind

Sol              Sim    La               Re
Speak sparrow speak please won't you try
Mim                Fa#7         Sim                Mi9 
Tell me why you'd walk if you knew that you could fly
Sol              Sim       La               Re
Speak sparrow speak oh please won't you try
Mim              Fa#7             Sim           Mi9     
Tell me all the answers to this meaningless life

           Sol
But you're up on that tree
        Sim
And you look in my eyes
Sol                  Sim
I wonder what goes on in your mind

Sol             Sim             La               Re
Stay, sparrow stay, won't you stay in my window
    Mim              Fa#7         Sim             Mi9     
I've never been so close to anything so beautiful
Sol             Sim        La               Re
Wait, sparrow wait, oh please don't you go
  Mim              Fa#7         Sim               Mi9     
I love the way I felt as the, vast the wind it blows

           Sol
But you're up on that tree
        Sim
And you look in my eyes
Sol                  Sim
I wonder what goes on in your mind

Sol             Sim    La               Re
Sing, sparrow sing, sing away our pain
Mim                 Fa#7           Sim             Mi9         
When you get to the bones of it, we are just the same
       Sol           Sim     La             Re
I said sing sparrow sing, sing away our pain
    Mim           Fa#7        Sim          Mi9   
I'll never hear a melody as sweet as today

             Sol
Cause you're up in that tree
        Sim
And you look in my eyes
Sol                            Sim
And I wonder how, but you're saying goodbye</pre>]
