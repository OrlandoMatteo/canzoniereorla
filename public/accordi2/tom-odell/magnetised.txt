Three thousand miles they fly
            La                 Sim
How do they know which way to go?
               Fa#m               
Somehow they always seem to know
Sol                  La                            Sim
   They say there's mother nature in everything we see

Falling asleep with so much trust
               La                  Sim
I wish I had a chance to let them know
                      Fa#m            Sol
Their love is like a flower in the snow
                   La                   Sim
If it's just  pheromones then that may be
