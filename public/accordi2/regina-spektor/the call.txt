[<pre>   Sol                Re
It started out as a feeling
           Mim          Do
Which then grew into a hope
           Sol             Re
Which then turned into a quiet thought
           Mim                  Do
Which then turned into a quiet word
    Re                   Re7
And then that word grew louder and louder
 Sol            Re       Mim
'Til it was a battle cry


          Do
I'll come back
         Re    Sol
When you call me
Mim                  Re
No need to say goodbye


Sol                         Re
Just because everything's changing
                  Mim                    Do
Doesn't mean it's never been this way before
Sol                        Re
All you can do is try to know who your friends are
   Mim                  Do
As you head off to the war
Re                  Re7
Pick a star on the dark horizon
    Sol      Re    Mim
And follow the light


            Do
You'll come back 
          Re Sol
When it's over
Mim          Re       Mim
No need to say goodbye
            Do            
You'll come back 
          Re Sol
When it's over
Mim          Re       Sol
No need to say goodbye

Do Mim Re


Sol                       Re
Now we're back to the beginning
            Mim                       Do
It's just a feeling and no one knows yet
    Sol                       Re
But just because they can't feel it too
        Mim                       Do
Doesn't mean that you have to forget
Re                      Re7
Let your memories grow stronger and stronger
Sol               Re         Mim
'Til they're before your eyes


            Do
You'll come back
          Re    Sol
When they call you
Mim          Re       Mim
No need to say goodbye
            Do
You'll come back
          Re    Sol
When they call you
Mim          Re       Do
No need to say goodbye</pre>]
