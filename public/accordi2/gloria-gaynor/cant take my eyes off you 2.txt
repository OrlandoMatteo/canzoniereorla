                La#
You're just too good to be true
              La#maj7
Can't take my eyes off of you
              La#7
You'd be like heaven to touch
        Re#
I wanna hold you so much
             Re#m
At long last love has arrived
            La#
And I thank God I'm alive
                Do/La#           Dom/La#
You're just too good to be true
              La#

Pardon the way that I stare
                La#maj7
There's nothing else to compare
                 La#7
The sight of you leaves me weak
             Re#
There are no words left to speak
          Re#m
So if you feel like I feel
              La#
Please let me know that it's real
                Do/La#            Dom/La#
You're just too good to be true
              La#
Can't take my eyes off of you
