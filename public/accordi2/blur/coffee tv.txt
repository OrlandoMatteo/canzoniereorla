Si                                 Lam          Mi
   Do you feel like a chain store? Practically floored
Sol            Fa    La#              Do#
   One of many zeros, kicked around, bored
Si                                      Lam               Mi
   Your ears are full but you're empty, holding out your heart
Sol                    Fa     La#           La
   To people who never really  care how you are

           Do#m7          Si   La
So give me Coffee and TV, easily
     Do#m7            Mi
I've seen so much I'm going blind
        La    La7         Si
And I'm brain-dead, virtually
Do#m7             Si              La
Sociability, it's hard enough for me
Do#m7                  Mi
Take me away form this big bad world
      La     La7   Re                  La
And agree to marry me, so we can start over again

Si                              Lam         Mi
   Do you go to the country? It isn't very far
Sol                              Fa      La#                Do#
   There's people there who will hurt you 'cause of who you are
Si
   Your ears are full of their language
           Lam                  Mi
   there's wisdom there, you're sure
Sol                     Fa       La#                     La
   Till the words start slurring  and you can't find the door

           Do#m7          Si   La
So give me Coffee and TV, easily
     Do#m7            Mi
I've seen so much I'm going blind

And I'm brain-dead, virtually
Do#m7             Si              La
