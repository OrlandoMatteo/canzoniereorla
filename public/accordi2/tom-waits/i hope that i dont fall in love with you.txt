       Re                Sol               La4  La  La4 La
Well I hope that I don’t fall in love with you,
      Re         Sol                La4   La  La4 La
cause fallin’ in love just makes me blue
         Sol             Re/Fa#           La              Re7
Well the music plays and you display your heart for me to see
  Sol            Re/Fa#         Sol            La4  La  La4 La
I had a beer and now I hear you callin’ out to me
      Re                Sol     La        Re   Re4  Re
And I hope that I don’t fall in love with you

         Re              Sol         La4    La  La4 La
Well the room is crowded people everywhere,
      Re              Sol         La4    La  La4 La
and I wonder should I offer you a chair
        Sol           Re/Fa#          La                  Re7
Well if you sit, with this old clown, take this frown and break it
  Sol               Re/Fa#      Sol               La4     La  La4 La
Before the evenings gone away I think that we can make it
      Re                Sol     La        Re    Re4  Re
And I hope that I don’t fall in love with you

      Re               Sol                La4  La  La4 La
I can see that you are lonesome just like me,
    Re              Sol            La4  La  La4 La
and maybe you would like some company
     Sol                Re/Fa#          La                 Re7
Well I turned around to look at you and you looked back at me
    Sol                Re/Fa#            Sol                 La4  La  La4 La
The guy you’re with he up and split, the chair next to you’s free
      Re                 Sol      La        Re  Re4  Re
And I hope that you don’t fall in love with me

And I hope that you don’t fall in love with you

         Re               Sol             La4  La  La4 La
Well the night does funny things inside a man,
          Re               Sol            La4   La  La4 La
these old Tom Cat feelings you don’t understand
       Sol            Re/Fa#           La          Re7
Well I turn around to look at you, you light a cigarette
  Sol            Re/Fa#          Sol            La4  La  La4 La
I wish I had the guts to bum one but we’d never met
      Re                Sol     La        Re   Re4  Re
And I hope that I don’t fall in love with you

         Re          Sol                  La4  La  La4 La
Now it’s closing time, the music’s fadin’ out
     Re                   Sol           La4  La  La4 La
Last call for drinks I’ll have another stout
       Sol              Re/Fa#                 La            Re7
Well I turned around to look at you, you where nowhere to be found
  Sol                    Re/Fa#                    Sol          La4   La  La4 La
I searched the place for your lost face guess I’ll have another round
      Re                Sol     La        Re   Re4  Re
And I think that I just fell in love with you
