La
 I thought I saw you in the Battleship
Re                   Sim
 but it was only a look-a-like
La
 She was nothing but a vision trick
Re          Sim
 Under the warning light
        Fa#m     La                        Fa#m
She was close, close enough to be your ghost
         La
But my chances turned to toast
        Re             Sim               
When I asked her if I could call 
La Fa#m La Fa#m
her your name


La
I thought I saw you in the Rusty Hook
Re                 Sim
 Huddled up in a wicker chair
La
 I wandered over for a closer look
Re                        Sim
 And kissed whoever was sitting there
        Fa#m             La                  Fa#m
She was close, and she held me very tightly
        La                      Re
'Til I asked awfully politely, please
    Sim           La    Fa#m   La   Fa#m  Mi
Can I call you her name


      Re                  Sim
And I elongated my lift home,
Fa#m                                    Re
   Yeah, I let him go the long way 'round
  Sim
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
     Mi
And kept my shortcuts to myself


La Re Mi


La
 I thought I saw you in the Parrot's Beak,
Re                   Sim
 Messing with the smoke alarm,
La
 It was too loud for me to hear her speak,
Re                Sim
 And she had a broken arm,
       Fa#m    La                            Fa#m
It was close, so close that the walls were wet
         La                     Re
And she wrote it out in letra-set
         Sim                Do#m
No, you can't call me her name


La                      Do#m
 Tell me where's your hiding place
La                    Do#m
 I'm worried I'll forget your face
    Fa#m
And I've asked everyone
    Sim                       Mi             Mi6 
I'm beginning to think I imagined you all along


      Re                  Sim
And I elongated my lift home,
Fa#m                                    Re
   Yeah, I let him go the long way 'round
  Sim
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
    Rem
And kept my shortcuts to myself


La Re Sim
La Re Sim
Fa#m Sim
Re Mi


La
 I saw your sister in the Cornerstone
Re                     Sim
 On the phone to the middle man
La
 When I saw that she was on her own
Re                     Sim
 I thought she might understand
        Fa#m              La                  Fa#m
She was close, well you couldn't get much closer
              La                          Re
She said I'm really not supposed to but yes,
         Sim                 La
You can call me anything you want</pre>]
