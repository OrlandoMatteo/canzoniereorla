                            Re#     Dom
Have you got colour in your cheeks?
                               Rem       Solm
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift

The type that sticks around like summat in your teeth?
               Re#          Dom
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
                      Rem       Solm
Have you no idea that you're in deep?

I dreamt about you nearly every night this week
         Re#           Dom
How many secrets can you keep?
                           Rem        Solm
'Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think

of you somehow and I play it on repeat
Re#       Dom
  Until I fall asleep
                      Re7
Spilling drinks on my settee

 Solm Re#
(Do I wanna know?)
        Dom
If this feeling flows both ways?
        Solm
(Sad to see you go)

Was sort of hoping that you'd stay
       Re#
(Baby, we both know)
         Dom
That the nights were mainly made for saying
Solm
things that you can't say tomorrow day

                 Solm
Crawling back to you
                Re#     Dom
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
                Solm
'Cause I always do
                         Re#      Dom
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
                    Solm
Now I've thought it through

Crawling back to you

                    Re#   Dom
So have you got the guts?
                       Rem           Solm
Been wondering if your heart's still open

and if so I wanna know what time it shuts
Re#         Dom
 Simmer down and pucker up
                  Rem
I'm sorry to interrupt
     Solm                                         Re#      Dom
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of trying to kiss you
                    Rem      Solm
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
                Re#     Dom              Re7
But we could be together   if you wanted to

 Solm Re#
(Do I wanna know?)
        Dom

                Fa7
Ever thought of calling darling?
      Re#
(Do I wanna know?)
               Dom              Solm
Do you want me crawling back to you?
