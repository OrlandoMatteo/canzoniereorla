[<pre>Mim                            Do     Lam
 Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Lam                                        Mim  
 Do you ever get the fear that you can't shift the type
                         Mim 
that sticks around like summat in your teeth?
                Do             Lam
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
                                 Mim
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
                           Mim
I dreamt about you nearly every night this week
          Do             Lam
How many secrets can you keep?
                                    Mim
Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow
      Mim 
And I play it on repeat
Do         Lam
 Until I fall asleep
                       Si
Spilling drinks on my settee


      Do
Do I wanna know
         Lam
if this feeling flows both ways?
        Mim
Sad to see you go
          Mim
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
      Do 
Baby we both know
          Lam
That the nights were mainly made
             Mim                               Mim
for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day


                  Mim
Crawlin' back to you
                Do       Lam
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few
             Mim
Cos I always do
          Mim             Do         Lam
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
                     Mim
Now I've thought it through
                  Mim
Crawlin' back to you


                    Do    Lam
So have you got the guts?
                                    Mim
Been wondering if your hearts still open
                   Mim
And if so I wanna know what time it shuts
Do              Lam
 Simmer down and pucker up

I'm sorry to interrupt
     Mim
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp
             Do        Lam
Of trying to kiss you
                              Mim
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
               Do        Lam               
But we could be together
              Si
if you wanted to


      Do
Do I wanna know
         Lam
if this feeling flows both ways?
        Mim
Sad to see you go

      Do
Do I wanna know
                Lam      
Too busy being yours to fall
        Mim
Sad to see you go
                 Re                  
Ever thought of calling darling?
      Do
Do I wanna know
                Lam             Mim
Do you want me crawling back to you?</pre>]
