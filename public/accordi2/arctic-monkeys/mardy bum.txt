Re                Fa#
Well, now then Mardy Bum
Sol
I see your frown and it's like 
Fa#m             Mim
looking down the barrel of a gun
                Re
And it goes off
                        Fa#
And out come all these words
              Sol             Fa#m
Oh, there's a very pleasant side to you
  Mim                    La
A side I much prefer, it's one that


Solsus2                 La
Laughs and jokes around
        Re               La
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
        Sim
To get things off the ground and it was
Solsus2            La
     up, up and away
             Re             La
oh, but it's right hard to remember that
     Sim
on a day like today when you're all
Solsus2            La
    argumentative and you've 
got the face on

Re    Fa#    Sol    Fa#m    Mim    La


Re                    Fa#
Well, now then Mardy Bum
          Sol       Fa#m
Oh I'm in trouble again 
Mim        La                 Re
aren't I? I thought as much.
                        Fa#
Coz you've turned over there 
             Sol          Fa#m
Pulling that silent disappointment face 
Mim                              La
The one that I can't bear.

Well, can't we...


Solsus2                 La
Just laugh and joke around?
        Re               La

    Fa#5                   Sol5
And yeah, I'm sorry I was late
    Fa#5                                      Sol5
But I missed the train and the traffic was a state
    Fa#5                                  Sol5
And I can't be arsed to carry on in this debate that reoccurs 
Fa#5                                          Sol5
Oh, when you say I don't care, but of course I do 
                 La5
Yeah, I clearly do.
