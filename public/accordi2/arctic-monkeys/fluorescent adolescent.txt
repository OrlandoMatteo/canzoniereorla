[<pre>Mi Do#m Fa#m Si


                            Mi
You used to get it in your fishnets
                             Do#m
Now you only get it in your night dress
                                    Fa#m
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
                        Si
Landed in a very common crisis
                            Mi
Everything's in order in a black hole
                               Do#m
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
                                Fa#m
The Bloody Mary's lacking her Tabasco
                               Si
Remember when you used to be a rascal?


               Fa#m
Oh the boy's a slag
                     Si
The best you ever had
                     Fa#m
The best you ever had
          Si                Fa#m
Is just a memory and those dreams
               Si
But as daft as they seem
               Fa#m
As daft as they seem
                  La
My love when you dream them up...


                                   Mi
Flicking through a little book of sex tips
                                  Do#m
Remember when the boys were all electric?
                                Fa#m
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
                                     Si
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
                             Mi
Clinging to not getting sentimental
                              Do#m
Said she wasn't going but she went still
                               Fa#m
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
                                   Si
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?


               Fa#m
Oh the boy's a slag
                  Si
The best you ever had
                  Fa#m

                Fa#m
As daft as they seem
                 Si
My love when you dream them up
   Sol#m               Do#m
Oh Flo, where did you go?
              Fa#m
Where did you go?
              Sol#m  Fa#m
Where did you go? Woah.

Mi          Do#m
Falling about
    Fa#m                        Si
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
              Mi             Do#m
You were just sounding it out
Fa#m                       Si
You're not coming back again.
