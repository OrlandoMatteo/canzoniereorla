  The mirror's image,
Sim
  It tells me it's home time,
Fa#m          Re
  But I'm not finished,
Sim
 'Cause you're not by my side
Fa#m         Re                      Sim
  And as I arrived I thought I saw you leaving,

Carrying your shoes,
Fa#m           Re                Sim
  Decided that once again I was just dreaming,
                 Fa#m
Of bumping into you
    Re                Sim
Now it's three in the morning,
                              Fa#m
And I'm trying to change your mind,
         Re              Sim
Left you multiple missed calls
                        Fa#m
And to my message you reply
Re                                 Sim
Why'd you only call me when you're high?
Fa#m
High

 Somewhere darker,
Sim
 Talking the same shite,
Fa#m      Re
 I need a partner,
Sim
 Well are you out tonight?
Fa#m              Re                 Sim
  It's harder and harder to get you to listen,
                       Fa#m
More I get through the gears,
    Re                      Sim
incapable of making alright decisions,
                 Fa#m
and having bad ideas

            Fa#m                   Sim   Re
And I can't see you here when I'm high,
        Fa#m                          Sim   Re
Sort of feels like I'm running out of time,
          Fa#m                       Sim   Re
I haven't found all I was hoping to find,
                    Do#7
You said you got to be up in the morning,

Gonna have an early night,

And you starting to bore me, baby,

         Re                             Fa#m
Why'd you only ever call me when you're high?
          Re                             Fa#m
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
