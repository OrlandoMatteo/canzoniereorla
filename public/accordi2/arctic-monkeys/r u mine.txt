Tracy Island,

Cutter shaped heartaches

Come to find you

Four in some velvet morning

Years too late

She's a silver lining

Lone ranger riding

Through an open space
      Re                  Sim
In my mind when she's not right there beside me
Fa#m                Re                     Sim
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
    Fa#m          Re                      Sim
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
    Fa#m
And I can't help myself,
    Re  Sim                            Fa#m
All I   wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
              Fa#m   Re Sim
Well, are you mine?
        Fa#m   Re Sim
Are you mine?
        Fa#m   Sol  Re Sim
Are you mine?

             Fa#m
I guess what I'm trying to say
              Re
Is I need the deep end
      Sim
Keep imagining meeting,

Wished away entire lifetimes

Unfair we're not somewhere

Misbehaving for days

Great escape
              Fa#m
Lost track of time and space
               Re              Sim
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

All I   wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
               Fa#m          Re        Sim
Well, are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
        Fa#m           Re      Sim
Are you mine? (or just mine tonight?)
        Fa#m           Re     Sim
Are you mine? (are you mine? Mine?)

Fa#m   Re Sim

                   Re
And the thrill of the chase
                 Fa#m
Moves in mysterious ways
      La
So in case I'm mistaken,
  Sim                 Re
I just wanna hear you say
     Do#m    Sim  La      Fa#m
"You got me, baby Are you mine?"
