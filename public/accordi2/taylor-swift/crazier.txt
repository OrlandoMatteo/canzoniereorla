[<pre>Re La Sim Sol (Sol)



Re                       La
I'd never gone with the wind
            Mim
Just let it flow
       Sol            (La)          Re
Let it take me where it wants to go
                  La                    Mim
Till you open the door there's so much more
           Sol
I've never seen it before
      La         Sim        Sol
I was trying to fly but I couldn't find wings
    La          Sim          Sol
But you came along and you changed everything



Re                        La
You lift my feet off the ground
              Sim
You spin me around
            Sol
You make me crazier, crazier
Re                          La
Feels like I'm falling and I
                 Sim
I'm lost in your eyes
            Sol                (Sol)
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier



  Re                          La
I watched from a distance as you
               Mim 
Made life your own
      Sol           (La)          Re
Every sky was your own kind of blue
                La                   Mim
And I wanted to know how that would feel
        Sol
And you made it so real
La             Sim             Sol
You showed me something that I couldn't see
La             Sim           Sol
You opened my eyes and you made me believe



Re                        La
You lift my feet off the ground
              Sim
You spin me around
            Sol
You make me crazier, crazier
Re                          La
Feels like I'm falling and I
                 Sim
I'm lost in your eyes
            Sol                (Sol)
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

La        Sim             Sol
Baby you showed me what living is for
  La             Sim     Sol
I don't want to hide anymore

You make me crazier, crazier
Re                          La

I'm lost in your eyes
            Sol
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
Sol
Crazier, crazier</pre>]
