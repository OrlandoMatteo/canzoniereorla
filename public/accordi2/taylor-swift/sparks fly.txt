[<pre>Lam Fa Do Sol x2


Lam                          Fa
 The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
Do                    Sol
 And I'm a house of cards
           Lam                            Fa
 You're the kind of reckless that should send me running
      Do                  Sol
 But I kinda know that I won't get far


Fa                        Sol
 And you stood there in front of me just
Do       Sol        Lam
 Close enough to touch
Fa                                  Sol
 Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinking of


                Lam
Drop everything now
               Fa
Meet me in the pouring rain
Do
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Sol
Take away the pain
       Lam     Fa              Do          Sol
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
                  Lam
Get me with those green eyes, baby
       Fa
As the lights go down
        Do                          Sol
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
       Lam     Fa              Do       Sol  Lam Fa Do Sol
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile


Lam           Fa
 My mind forgets to remind me
Do              Sol
 You're a bad idea
Lam                         Fa
 You touch me once and it's really something
     Do                            Sol     
 You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be


Fa                        Sol
 I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
           Do    Sol            Lam
 But with you I know it's no good
Fa
 And I could wait patiently but
Sol
 I really wish you would


                Lam
Drop everything now
               Fa
Meet me in the pouring rain
Do
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Sol
Take away the pain
       Lam     Fa              Do          Sol
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
                  Lam
Get me with those green eyes, baby
       Fa
As the lights go down
        Do                          Sol
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
       Lam     Fa              Do       Sol  Lam Fa Do Sol
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile


  Lam             Fa
I run my fingers through your hair
    Do                   Sol
And watch the lights go wild
     Lam                    Fa
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
          Do                             Sol
It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
    Lam               Fa
And lead me up the staircase
          Do                 Sol
Won't you whisper soft and slow
    Lam         Fa                  Do             Sol
I'm captivated by you baby like a fireworks show

 
               Lam
Drop everything now
               Fa
Meet me in the pouring rain
Do
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Sol
Take away the pain
       Lam     Fa              Do             Sol
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
                  Lam
Get me with those green eyes, baby
       Fa
As the lights go down
        Do                          Sol
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
       Lam     Fa              Do       Sol  Lam Fa
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
     Do      Sol       Lam    Fa          Do     Sol Lam
And the sparks fly, baby smile, and the sparks fly</pre>]
