Sol                         Sim/Fa#
There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles
Dosus2                       Sol
Same old tired, lonely place
Sol                    Sim/Fa#
Walls of insincerity Shifting eyes and vacancy 
Dosus2                       Sol
vanished when I saw your face
                     Dosus2             Mim7    Re/Fa#
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Sol
Your eyes whispered "have we met?"
Sim/Fa#                             Dosus2                Sol
Across the room your silhouette starts to make its way to me
    Sol                           Sim/Fa#
The playful conversation starts Counter all your quick remarks 
      Dosus2                 Sol
like passing notes in secrecy
        Dosus2             Mim7    Re/Fa#
And it was enchanting to meet you
                    Dosus2            Mim7    Re/Fa#
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you


Dosus2            Sol        Re/Fa#           Dosus2
 This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
            Sol             Re/Fa#          Dosus2
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
              Sol     Re/Fa#            Dosus2
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
                    Mim7   Re/Fa# Sol
I was enchanted to meet you


      Sol                          Sim/Fa#
The lingering question kept me up 2am, who do you love?
  Dosus2                    Sol
I wonder till I'm wide awake
Sol                             Sim/Fa#
Now I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door
      Dosus2                   Sol
I'd open up and you would say,
        Dosus2             Mim7    Re/Fa#
It was enchanting to meet you
                    Dosus2          Mim7    Re/Fa#
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you


Dosus2            Sol        Re/Fa#            Dosus2
 This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
            Sol             Re/Fa#          Dosus2
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
              Sol     Re/Fa#            Dosus2 Mim7 Re/Fa#
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
Dosus2           Sol         Re/Fa#           Dosus2  
 This night is flawless, don't you let it go
          Sol                Re/Fa#        Dosus2
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
              Sol     Re/Fa#             Dosus2
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
                    Mim7   Re/Fa# Sol
I was enchanted to meet you

                        Dosus2                    Mim7
This is me praying that this was the very first page
               Re/Fa#        Dosus2
Not where the story line ends
                            Mim7          Re/Fa#    Dosus2
My thoughts will echo your name until I see you again
                           Mim7            Re/Fa#      Dosus2
These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon
                   Mim7   Re/Fa# Sol
I was enchanted to meet you
Sol                            Sim/Fa#
Please don't be in love with someone else
Dosus2                       Sol
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
