Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won’t see
Sol      Mim           Do        Re
That I want and I’m needing, everything that we should be


Mim                      Do
I'll bet she’s beautiful, that girl he talks about
Sol                             Re
And she’s got everything that I have to live without


Sol      Mim     Do     Re
Drew talks to me, I laugh cause it’s just so funny
Sol        Mim       Do    Re
That I can’t even see, anyone when he’s with me


Mim                       Do
He says he’s so in love, he’s finally got it right
Sol                         Re
I wonder if he knows he’s all I think about at night


Sol                       Re
He’s the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
Mim                           Do
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Sol                   Re                             Mim     Do
He’s the song in the car I keep singing, don’t know why I do


Sol    Mim       Do   Re
Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can’t breathe?
Sol            Mim             Do
And there he goes so perfectly
            Re
The kind of flawless I wish I could be


Mim                           Do
She’d better hold him tight, give him all her love
Sol                            Re
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she’s lucky cause


Sol                       Re
He’s the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
Mim                           Do
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Sol                  Re                             Mim     Do
He’s the song in the car I keep singing, don’t know why I do


Mim                     Do
So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light
Sol                           Re
I put his picture down, and maybe get some sleep tonight

Sol                             Re
Cause he’s the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
Mim                      Do
The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart


Sol                  Re                            Mim     Do
He’s the song in the car I keep singing, don’t know why I do
         Sol                           Re         
He’s the time, taken up, but there’s never enough
         Mim                      Do
And he’s all that I need to fall into
