Re
There's something 'bout the way
La                               Mim
The street looks when it's just rained
                       Sol
There's a glow off the pavement
               Re
Walk me to the car
                     La                      Mim
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
                     Sol
In the middle of the parking lot
     Re La Mim Sol
Yeah     Oh Yeah
Re
We're drivin' down the road
La               Mim
I wonder if you know
                   Sol
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
Re
But you're just so cool
La                           Mim
Run your hands through your hair
                Sol         La
Absent-mindedly making me want you


Re                    La
And I don't know how it gets better than this
Mim                           Sol           La
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
Re                    La
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
Mim               Sol           La
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

Re                  La
So baby drive slow till we run out of road
Mim
In this one horse town
Sol                       Re
I wanna stay right here in this passenger seat
La

Mim                 Sol          La
In this moment now capture it remember it


Re                      La

Mim                           Sol           La
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
Re                    La
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
Mim               Sol           La
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
