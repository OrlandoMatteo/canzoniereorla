Sol               Re4         Doadd9             Re4
It feels like a perfect night, to dress up like hipsters
Sol                   Re4 Doadd9   Re4
And make fun of our exes,  uh uh, uh uh
Sol               Re4         Doadd9             Re4
It feels like a perfect night, for breakfast at midnight
Sol                    Re4      Doadd9   Re4
To fall in love with strangers,  uh uh, uh uh

G     D4
Yeaaaah
      Doadd9           Re4                   Sol
We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
     Doadd9         Re4       Sol  
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
  Doadd9                     Re4            Sol
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines

It's time, uh uh

 I don't know about you,    but I'm feeling twenty-two
                    Cadd9   Re4                      Sol
Everything will be alright if,  you keep me next to you
                    D4 Cadd9               Em7 D4
You don't know about me,     but I bet you want to

Sol             Re4
It seems like one of those nights
Doadd9              Re4
 This place is too crowded 
Sol        Re4      Doadd9   Re4
Too many cool kids,  uh uh, uh uh 
Sol             Re4
It seems like one of those nights
Doadd9         Re4
 We ditch the whole scene 
Sol          Re4    Doadd9      Re4
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping

G     D4
