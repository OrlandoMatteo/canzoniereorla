 'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood

You know it used to be mad love

So take a look what you've done

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood

Hey

Now we got problems

And I don't think we can solve them

You made a really deep cut

And, baby, now we got bad blood

Hey
Do      Sol
Did you have to do this?
Re              Mim
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Do      Sol          Re           Mim
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?

Now it's all rusted
Do      Sol             Re
Did you have to hit me, where I'm weak?
      Mim
Baby, I couldn't breathe
    Do     Sol
And rub it in so deep,
Re                     Mim
salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me
Do   Sol       Re   Mim             Do          Sol     Re
 Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I

Hey

Do      Sol
Did you think we'd be fine?
Re                    Mim
Still got scars on my back from your knife
   Do          Sol
So don't think it's in the past,
Re                 Mim
these kinda wounds they last and they last
    Do      Sol
Now did you think it all through?
Re               Mim
All these things will catch up to you
    Do       Sol
And time can heal but this won't,
   Re                   Mim
so if you're coming my way, just don't

Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
Re4           Mim
You say sorry just for show
   Do
If you live like that,
Sol                  Re4  Mim
you live with ghosts (ghosts)
