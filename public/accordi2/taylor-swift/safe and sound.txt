I remember tears streaming down your face
       Sol                        Re 
When I said, I'll never let you go
     Mim                Sim                 Sol    Re
When all those shadows almost killed your light
Mim         Sim              Sol                 Re
I remember you said, Don't leave me here a - lone
    Mim                  Sim                Sol     
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

Just close your eyes
    La            Sol
The sun is going down

You'll be alright
   La                Sol
No one can hurt you now

Come morning light
La               Sim   La   Sol
You and I'll be safe and sound
