  Do                               Sol
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
    Lam                           Fa
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow, and I, 
Do                           Sol
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
        Lam                    Fa (once)
And you still got it, in your drawer, even now


Do Sol Lam Fa


        Do                       Sol
Oh your sweet dispositon and my wide eyed gaze
      Lam                         Fa
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
Do                               Sol
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
      Lam                   Fa
And I can picture it after all these days


      Do                             Sol
And I know it's long gone and, that magic's not here no more
      Lam                        Sol         Fa  Sol  Lam  Sol
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all oh, oh, oh


       Do                          Sol
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
    Lam                                 Fa
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
           Do                      Sol                 Lam   Fa
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well


      Do                         Sol
Photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red
                 Lam                           Fa
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin size bed
         Do                                       Sol
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on a t-ball team
    Lam                                      Fa
You taught me 'bout your past thinkin' your future was me


      Do                              Sol
And I know it's long gone and it was nothing else I could do
      Lam                              Sol                   Fa Sol Lam Sol
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to


       Do                        Sol
'Cause here we are again in the middle of the night
      Lam                                Fa
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
         Do                        Sol                 Lam   Fa
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well


Do Sol Lam Fa Sol


             Do                           Sol
Maybe we got lost in translation maybe I asked for too much
               Lam                               Fa
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
        Do                        Sol                Lam  Fa
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
         Do                        Sol
Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise
   Lam                         Fa
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
          Do                           Sol
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lyin' here
                    Lam       Fa          Do Sol Lam Fa
Cause I remember it all all all too well

Do                            Sol
Time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
            Lam                           Fa
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still tryin' to find it
      Do                                    Sol
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
        Lam                        Fa
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
        Do                           Sol
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
            Lam                            Fa
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
              Do                    Sol                   Lam    Fa
You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah


       Do                         Sol
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Lam                                Fa
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
       Do                      Sol                Lam  Fa
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
           Do                           Sol
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
         Lam                            Fa
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
       Do                      Sol                Lam Fa
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well</pre>]
