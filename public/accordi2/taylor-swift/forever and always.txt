Once upon a time, I believe it was a Tuesday
       Doadd9                      Sol             Re
When I caught your eye, we caught onto something
         Doadd9             Sol                Re
I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye
            Doadd9     Re
And told me you loved me, were you just kidding?

          Doadd9           Sol                 Re
'Cause it seems to me this thing is breaking down
          Doadd9                     Sol          Re
We almost never speak, I don't feel welcome anymore
          Doadd9
Baby what happened
                         Sol
Please tell me cause one second it was perfect
           Re
Now you're halfway out the door


            Doadd9                  Sol
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
             Re                         Mim7
And then you feel so low you can't feel, nothing at all
        Doadd9             Sol                   Re
And you flashback to when he said forever and always

           Doadd9                  Sol
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
   Re                              Mim7
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
       Doadd9            Sol                    Re
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always


      Doadd9                  Sol                Re
Was I out of line? Did I say something way to honest?
         Doadd9               Sol             Re
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
           Doadd9                   Sol              Re
I looked into your eyes, thought I knew you for a minute
        Doadd9  Re
Now I'm not so sure
 
             Doadd9     (Sol)            (Re)
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
          Doadd9        Sol              Re
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
              Doadd9
Where is this going?
          Sol          Re            Doadd9    Re        
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore


            Doadd9                  Sol
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
