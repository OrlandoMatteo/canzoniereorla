Sol                    Re
I am not the kind of girl 
              Lam
Who should be rudely barging in
     Do
On a white veil occasion 
    Sol                       Re
But you are not the kind of boy 
              Lam                    Do -stop
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

Sol                       Re
I sneak in and see your friends 
        Lam
And her snotty little family 
    Do
All dressed in pastel 
    Sol                   Re
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
          Lam
Somewhere back inside a room 
          Do
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

Lam      Do      Sol
Thi--is i---is surely not 
                          Re
What you thought it would be
Lam   Do                  Re
I---I  lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say


Sol                Re

And they said "Speak Now"


Sol Re Lam Do


Sol                   Re
Fond gestures are exchanged 
        Lam
And the organ starts to play a song 
     Do
That sounds like a death march
    Sol                     Re
And I am hiding in the curtains
              Lam
It seems that I was uninvited 
        Do
By your lovely bride-to-be

Lam      Do
She---e floats down the aisle 
       Sol            Re
Like a pageant queen 
    Lam   Do
But I--I kno--ow

You wish it was me- Don't you?
