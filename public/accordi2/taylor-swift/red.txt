[<pre>Fa  Lam  Sol

                    Fa                 Lam
Lovin' him is like, drivin' a new Maserati
                Sol
Down a dead end street
Fa                           Lam
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
         Sol
Ended so suddenly
                    Fa
Loving him is like, tryin' to change your mind 
            Lam                         Sol
Once you're already flying through the free fall
         Fa                  Lam
Like the colors in autumn so bright
                 Sol          N.C.
Just before they lose it all


               Fa                    Do
Losing him was blue, like I'd never known
                Sol
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
                   Fa                       Lam
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody
          Sol
You never met
                   Fa
But loving him was red
          Lam        Sol
Re ee ed, re ee ed, re ee ed
               Fa
Lovin' him was red
          Lam        Sol
Re ee ed, re ee ed, re ee ed


                       Fa                      Lam
Touching him was like, realizing all you ever wanted 
                   Sol
Was right there in front of you
                       Fa                       Lam
Memorizing him was as, easy as knowin' all the words
                    Sol
To your old favorite song
                           Fa 
Fighting with him was like tryin' to solve a 
              Lam                           Sol
Crossword and realizing there's no right answer
                        Fa                        Lam
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out 
                       Sol
That love could be that strong 


               Fa                    Do
Losing him was blue, like I'd never known
                Sol
Missing him was dark grey, all alone

Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody
          Sol
You never met
                   Fa
But loving him was red
          Lam           Sol
Re ee ed, re ee ed, oh red, re ee ed
        Fa              Lam
Burnin' red, re ee ed, re ee ed
Sol
Re ee ed, 


                         Fa               Do
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echos
                    Lam             Sol
Tellin' myself it's time now gotta let go 
                   Fa
But moving on from him is impossible 
     Do                       Sol     
When I still see it all in my, head 
            Fa   Lam  Sol
And burning red
       Fa      Lam  Sol
Burning was reeeeed
  

                Fa            Do  N.C.
Oh losing him was blue, like I'd never known
                Sol Sol Sol N.C.           Sol

Oh Burning reeeeeeeed

And that's Why he's spinnin' 'round in my head
                              Fa   
Comes back to me, burnin' red
