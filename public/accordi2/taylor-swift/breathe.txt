  Sol                   Re4           Doadd9
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
       Sol                         Re4       Doadd9
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
Sol                         Re4            Doadd9
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
         Sol                    Re4           Doadd9
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time


Sol           Re4         Doadd9
  Mm mm mm, mm mm mm mmm mmm
Sol           Re4         Doadd9
  Mm mm mm, mm mm mm mmm mmm


Sol                            Re4       Doadd9
Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie
Sol                              Re4         Doadd9
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see
            Sol                Re4        Doadd9
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
    Sol                   Re4            Doadd9  Re  Re4
Now I don't know what to be without you around


Do                         Sol   
   And we know it's never simple, never easy
Re                       Mim7
   Never a clean break, no one here to save me
Do                       Sol                        Re5
You're the only thing I know, like the back of my hand

And I can't


Do       Sol  Re           Mim7
   Breathe   without you, but I have to
Do       Sol  Re           Mim7

Do       Sol  Re


Sol                        Re4      Doadd9
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Sol                        Re4         Doadd9
Every little bump in the road I try to swerve
Sol                         Re4             Doadd9
People are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
Sol                      Re4            Doadd9     Re  Re4
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out


Do                         Sol   
   And we know it's never simple, never easy

It's 2 am, feeling like I just lost a friend
                       Sol              Re
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
