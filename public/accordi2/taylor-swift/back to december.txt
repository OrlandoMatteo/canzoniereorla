Re
 I'm so glad you made the time to see me
Sim
 How's life, tell me how's your family
Sol                           Re   La
 I haven't seen them in a while
Re
 You've been good, busier than ever
Sim
 We small talk, work and the weather
Sol                              Re  La
 Your guard is up, and I know why


Sim                    La
 Because the last time you saw me
           Re                          Sol
 Is still burned in the back of your mind
              Sim          La                  Sol
 You gave me roses and I left them there to die


     Re
So this is me swallowing my pride
             Fa#m
Standing in front of you saying
                     Sol
"I'm sorry for that night" and I go
 Re                La
Back to December all the time
    Re
It turns out freedom ain't
 Re
Nothing but missing you
Fa#m
Wishing I'd realized what I had
      Sol
When you were mine

        Re
I'd go back to December,
 La                           Sol
Turn around and make it all right
     Sim               La
I go back to December all the time

Re
 These days I haven't been sleeping
Sim
 Stayin' up playing back myself leaving
Sol                                        Re  La
 When your birthday passed and I didn't call
         Re
 Then I think about summer all the beautiful times
Sim
 I watch you laughing from the passenger side
    Sol                             Re  La
 And realized I loved you in the fall


Sim                     La
 And then the cold came the dark days
       Re                  Sol
 When fear crept into my mind
             Sim
 You gave me all your love and
        La           Sol
 All I gave you was goodbye

 La                         Sol
Turn around and change my own mind

I go back to December all the time

             Sim                Sol
I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
    Re              La
So good to me, so right
             Sim              Sol
And how you held me in your arms
                Re
That September night
                    La           Sim
The first time you ever saw me cry
                              Sol
Maybe this is wishful thinking
                          Re
Probably mindless dreaming
 Re                                       La
If you loved again I swear I'd love you right

       Sim                La               Sol
I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
           Sim               La           Sol
So if the chain is on your door I understand

Back to December...
