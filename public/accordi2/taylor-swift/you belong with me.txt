Re                                                 La
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
                                         Mim
She's going off about something that you said 
                                       Sol
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
Re                                       La
I'm in the room it's a typical Tuesday night 
                                                Mim
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like 
                                      Sol
And she'll never know your story like I do 


    Mim                      Sol
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts 
Re                       La
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers 
Mim                              Sol
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
                La
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time 


             Re
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you 
La                                     Mim
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
                Sol                   Re
You belong with me, you belong with me

Re                                               La
Walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans 
                                              Mim
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be 
                                        Sol
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself 
Hey isn't this easy 
    Re                                                 La
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
                                                   Mim
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down 
You say you're fine, I know you better than that 
Sol
Hey whatcha doing with a girl like that 


Mim                    Sol
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers 
Re                      La
Shes cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers 
Mim                     Sol

                Sol
You belong with me
Re
Standing by and waiting at your back door 
La                                        Mim
All this time how could you not know, baby 
                Sol                    Re  
You belong with me, you belong with me 


Re La Mim Sol

                  Mim
Oh I remember you drivin' to my house
       Sol
In the middle of the night 
        Re
I'm the one who makes you laugh 
         La
When you know you're about to cry 
      Mim
And I know your favorite songs 
        Sol
And you tell me about your dreams 
        Re
Think I know where you belong 
        La
Think I know it's with me


          Re
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you 
La                                     Mim
Been here all along, so why can't you see?

You belong with me

You belong with me 
                              Mim
Have you ever thought just maybe

You belong with me, you belong with me</pre>]
