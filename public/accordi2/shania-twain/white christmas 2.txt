I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Dom                            La#
Just like the ones I used to know
           La#         La#7
Where the tree tops glisten
  Re#          Re#m
And children listen
          La#     Sol         Dom Fa
To hear sleigh bells in the snow


La#                 Dom
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
 Dom                           La#
With every Christmas card I write
               La#                     La#7
May your days, may your days, may your days
           Re#   Re#m
Be merry and bright
         La#          Fa           La#
And may all your Christmas' be white
