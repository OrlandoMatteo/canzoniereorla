(When I first saw you, I saw love
        La#                      Re#  Re#/Sol    Sol#add9
And the first time you touched me, I felt love
    La#                 Re#               Re#/Sol    Sol#add9  La#
And after all this time, you're still the one I love)

Look how far we've come, my baby
Re#                Re#/Sol
 We mighta took the long way
Sol#           La#
 We knew we'd get there someday

 They said, "I bet  they'll never make it"

              Re#           Sol#   La#
We're still together, still going strong

Re#            Re#/Sol
 Ain't nothing better
Sol#          La#
