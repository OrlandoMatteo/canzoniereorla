I'm going out tonight-I'm feelin' alright
                      Re#   La#
Gonna let it all hang out

Wanna make some noise-really raise my voice
                         Re#   La#
Yeah, I wanna scream and shout

La#
No inhibitions-make no conditions
                    Re#  La#
Get a little outta line

I ain't gonna act politically correct
                          Re#  La#  Sol#
I only wanna have a good time
                                    La#
The best thing about being a woman

Is the prerogative to have a little fun

Fa
 Oh, oh, oh, go totally crazy-forget I'm a lady

Men's shirts-short skirts
        Rem                      La#         Fa
Oh, oh, oh, really go wild-yeah, doin' it in style

Oh, oh, oh, get in the action-feel the attraction

Color my hair-do what I dare
         Rem                      La#               Solm7
Oh, oh, oh, I wanna be free-yeah, to feel the way I feel

Man! I feel like a woman!

The girls need a break-tonight we're gonna take
                              Re#  La#
The chance to get out on the town

We don't need romance-we only wanna dance
                              Re#   La#   Sol#
We're gonna let our hair hang down
