Do       Mim7                Lam                Sol
 All my life, I've seen myself through your eyes
Do     Mim7           Lam                   Sol
 Wonderin' if I am good enough for your time
    Famaj7                          Sol    Sol6 Sol7
You love me but for all the wrong reasons

Do      Mim7         Lam               Sol   Sol7
 Am I somethin' to you and not someone?
Do                Mim7            Lam                 Sol
 'Cause I feel trapped on this pedestal you put me on
    Famaj7                          
You tell me that I'm beautiful but 
 Sol        Sol6           Sol7
I think that's an understatement

       Do               Sol           Lam
'Cause I am more than what I am to you
                        Famaj7
You say I'm perfect but I've got thorns with my petals, too
    Do              Sol                      Lam
And I won't be confined to your point of view
                                  Famaj7
I'm breakin' through the glass you put me in
                   
'Cause my beauty's from within

Do  Sol            Lam
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
    Famaj7            Do
My beauty's from within
Do  Sol         Famaj7
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Do         Mim7         Lam                Sol
 So, I am done livin' my lifе just for you
Do                Mim7       Lam                    Sol
 You watched me wither and now you'll watch mе bloom
       Famaj7                                        Sol
You're hidin' in the dark but I'm reachin' for the sun, woo-ooh

       Do               Sol           Lam
'Cause I am more than what I am to you
    Famaj7
You say I'm pretty but I've got magic that you never knew
    Do              Sol                      Lam
And I won't be confined to your point of view
                                  Famaj7
I'm breakin' through the glass you put me in
       Do               Sol           Lam
'Cause I am more than what I am to you
                        Famaj7
You say I'm perfect but I've got thorns with my petals, too
    Do              Sol                      Lam
And I won't be confined to your point of view
                                  Famaj7
I'm breakin' through the glass you put me in
