[<pre>Do
 We broke up a month ago
       Lam
Your friends are mine
                             Rem
You know I know you've moved on
       Rem
Found someone new
          Sol                       Sol7
One more girl who brings out the better in you
    Do
And I thought my heart was detached
     Lam
From all the sunlight of our past
     Rem
But she's so sweet,
 Rem
She's so pretty
 Sol                 Sol7
Does she mean you forgot about me?
 
       Do
Oh, I hope you're happy
    Lam
But not like how you were with me
     Rem
I'm selfish, I know
   Rem
I can't let you go
    Sol                            Sol7
So find someone great but don't find no one better
Sol7                      
I hope you're happy but don't be happier

    Do                                 
And do you tell her she's the most 
                            Lam
beautiful girl you've ever seen?
                                               Rem
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
                 Rem
Remember when I believed
                       Sol       Sol7
You meant it when you said it first to me
     Do
And now I'm picking her apart
       Lam
Like cutting her down, will make you miss my wretched heart
            Rem
But she's beautiful, 
           Rem
She looks kind
       Sol                 Sol7
She probably gives you butterflies
 

   Do
I hope you're happy
    Lam
But not like how you were with me
     Rem
I'm selfish, I know
   Rem
I can't let you go
    Sol                            Sol7
So find someone great but don't find no one better
 

   Do
I hope you're happy
   Lam
I wish you all the best, really
    Rem
Say you love her, baby
     Rem
Just not like you loved me
     Sol                       Sol7
And think of me fondly when your hands are on her
   Sol7
I hope you're happy
    
But don't be happier
 
   Do                Lam                Rem       
Ohhhh oh, oh, oh, ohhhhh oh, oh, oh, ohhhhh, 
         Sol             Sol7Â 
oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, oh, oh, oh
 
   Do
I hope you're happy
     Lam
Just not like how you were with me
     Rem
I'm selfish, I know
   Rem
I can't let you go
    Sol                            Sol7
So find someone great but don't find no one better
   Sol7
I hope you're happy
    
But don't be happier</pre>]
