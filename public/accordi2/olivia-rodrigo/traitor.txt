      Oh       Oh       Oh       Ah       Ah       Ah        Ah        Ah

 Do                      Sol
Brown guilty eyes and little white lies
         Lam                      Famaj7
Yeah, I played dumb but I always knew
      Do                      Sol
That you talk to her, maybe did even worse
        Lam                   Famaj7
I kept quiet so I could keep you

               Do
And ain't it funny
         Sol
How you ran to her
      Lam                     Famaj7
The second that we called it quits
               Do
And ain't it funny
         Sol
How you said you were friends
        Lam                     Famaj7
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

      Do
You betrayed me
    Sol                              Lam
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
   Famaj7
For the way I hurt, yeah
 Do
You talked to her
     Sol
When we were together
      Lam
Loved you at your worst
    Famaj7
But that didn't matter
    Do
It took you two weeks
   Sol
To go off and date her
      Lam
Guess you didn't cheat
    
But you're still a traitor

Do
 Now you bring her around
     Sol
Just to shut me down
         Lam                   Famaj7
Show her off like she's a new trophy
           Do
And I know if you were true
            Sol
There's no damn way that you
               Lam                      Famaj7
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

          Do
Ain't it funny
     Sol
All the twisted games
          Lam                   Famaj7
All the questions you used to avoid?
           Do
Ain't it funny?
         Sol
Remember I brought her up
         Lam            Famaj7
And you told me I was paranoid

      Do
You betrayed me
    Sol                              Lam
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
   Famaj7
For the way I hurt, yeah
 Do
You talked to her
     Sol
When we were together
      Lam
Loved you at your worst
    Famaj7
But that didn't matter
    Do
It took you two weeks
   Sol
To go off and date her
       Lam
Guess you didn't cheat
N.C.
But you're still a traitor

Do     Sol           Lam
 (Ah, ah, ah, ah) God, I wish that you had thought this through
Famaj7
Before I went and fell in love with you
Do     Sol                         Lam
 (Ah, ah, ah, ah)  When she's sleeping in the bed we made
          Famaj7
Don't you dare forget about the way

      Do
You betrayed me
    Sol                              Lam
Cuz I know that you'll never feel sorry
   Famaj7
For the way I hurt, yeah
 Do
You talked to her
     Sol
When we were together
     Lam
You gave me your word
    Famaj7
But that didn't matter
    Do
It took you two weeks
   Sol
To go off and date her
      Lam
Guess you didn't cheat
    Famaj7                        Do  Sol Lam
But you're still, you're still a traitor (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
      Famaj7
Yeah, you're still a traitor

Do    Sol      Lam
 Oh, oh, oh God, I wish that you had thought this through
