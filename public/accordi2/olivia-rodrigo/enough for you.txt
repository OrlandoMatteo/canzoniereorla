Sol        Mim              Do
 I wore makeup when we dated
                             Sol
Cuz I thought you'd like me more
             Mim             Do
If I looked like the other prom queens
                        Sol
I know that you loved before
          Mim              Do
Tried so hard to be everything that you liked
      Sol         Mim                   Do
Just for you to say you're not the compliment type

Sol           Mim                 Do
 And I knew how you took your coffee
                             Sol
And your favorite songs by heart
       Mim                Do                                    
I read all of your self-help books 
                           Sol
So you'd think that I was smart
          Mim          Do
Stupid, emotional, obsessive little me
Sol                 Mim        
 I knew from the start this is 
      Do
exactly how you'd leave

              Sol          Mim
You found someone more exciting
           Do              Sol
The next second you were gone
Sol                       Mim   
 And you left me there crying, 
             Do         Sol
wondering what I did wrong
                Sol               Mim
And you always say I'm never satisfied
       Do                  Sol
But I don't think that's true
     Sol          Mim           Do          Sol
Cuz all I ever wanted was to be enough for you
       Sol           Mim          Do          Sol
Yeah, all I ever wanted was to be enough for you

Sol          Mim                Do     
 And maybe I'm just not as interesting 
                      Sol
as the girls you had before
             Mim                  Do
But God you couldn't have cared less about
                       Sol
Someone who loved you more
             Mim
I'd say you broke my heart
          Do                  
But you broke much more than that
     Sol                   Mim
Now, I don't want your sympathy
        Do
I just want myself back

                   Sol            Mim
Before you found someone more exciting
           Do              Sol
The next second you were gone
Sol                       Mim       Do        
 And you left me there crying, wondering what 
         Sol
I did wrong
                Sol               Mim
And you always say I'm never satisfied
       Do                  Sol
But I don't think that's true
     Sol          Mim           Do
Cuz all I ever wanted was to be enough
           Sol                Mim
And don't you think I loved you too much
       Do          Sol
To be used and discarded
           Sol                Mim
Don't you think I loved you too much
         Do           Sol
To think I deserve nothing
     Sol                    Mim
But don't tell me you're sorry, boy
      Do           Sol
Feel sorry for yourself
      Sol               Mim              Do
Cuz someday, I'll be everything to somebody else

                       Sol        Mim     
And they'll think that I am so exciting
Do           Sol                 Mim    
 And you'll be the one who's crying
Do                  Sol              Mim
 Yeah, you always say I'm never satisfied
    Do                     Sol
But I don't think that's true
     Sol              Mim
You say I'm never satisfied
     Do                   Sol
But that's not me, it's you

     Sol           Mim          Do
Cuz all I ever wanted was to be enough
    Sol               Mim            Do
But I don't think anything could ever be enough
    Sol Mim Do
For you
            Sol  Mim  Do
Enough for you
                          Sol
No, nothing's enough for you</pre>]
