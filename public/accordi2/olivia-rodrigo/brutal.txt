I want it to be like messy

Si5  La#5  La5 x2

Si5             La#5  La5
I'm so insecure I  think
 Si5                 La#5  La5
That I'll die before I  drink
    Si5               La#5     La5
And I'm so caught up in the news
   Si5                    La#5  La5
Of who likes me and who hates you
    La5
And I'm so tired that I might
 La5
Quit my job, start a new life
     Sol#5
And they'd all be so disappointed
     Sol5          Fa#5
Cuz who am I, if not exploited?
    Si5              La#5  La5
And I'm so sick of seventeen
 Si5                 La#5     La5
Where's my fuckin' teenage dream?
    Si5              La#5       La5
If someone tells me one more time
  Si5                     La#5  La5
"Enjoy your youth", I'm gonna cry
    La5
And I don't stick up for myself
     La5
I'm anxious and nothing can help
   Sol#5
And I wish I'd done this before
    Sol5             Fa#5
And I wish people likеd me more

Mi5
All I did was try my best
Mi5
This thе kinda thanks I get?
Si5                              La#5
Unrelentlessly upset  (huh, huh, huh)
(huh, huh, huh)
     La5
They say "These are the golden years"
      Mi5
But I wish I could disappear
Si5
Ego crush is so severe
Si5   
God, it's brutal out here

Si5 La#5 La5

Si5 La#5 La5
      Yeah!
Si5 La#5 La5

Si5 La#5 La5

Si5                 La#5   La5
I feel like no one wants me
    Si5                 La#5   La5
And I hate the way I'm perceived
  Si5            La#5   La5
I only have two real friends
     Si5           La#5     La5
And lately I'm a nervous wreck
    La5
Cuz I love people I don't like
    La5
And I hate every song I write
   Sol#5
And I'm not cool and I'm not smart
    Sol5            Fa#5
And I can't even parallel park

Mi5
All I did was try my best
