[<pre>Sol
  I got my driverâ€™s license last week
                            Mim
Just like we always talked about

'Cause you were so excited for me
                            Do
To finally drive up to your house

But today I drove through the suburbs
                           Sol
Crying 'cause you weren't around

Sol
  And you're probably with that blonde girl

Who always made me doubt
Mim
  She's so much older than me

She's everything I'm insecure about
        Do
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
                                    Sol
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?


    Do
And I know we weren't perfect
                                 Sol
but I've never felt this way for no one
    Do
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay
         Sol
now that I'm gone

      Mim         Re             Sol             Sim7    Do
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
       Do6                    Re                   Sol
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street


Sol
  And all my friends are tired

of hearing how much I miss you, but
Mim
   I kinda feel sorry for them

'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeah
  Do
Today I drove through the suburbs
                               Sol
and pictured I was driving home to you


    Do
And I know we weren't perfect
                                 Sol
but I've never felt this way for no one, ooh
    Do
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay
         Sol
now that I'm gone

        Mim         Re             Sol             Sim7    Do
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
       Do6                    Re                  Sol
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street


Mim
Red lights, stop signs
Do                            Sol
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Re                              Mim
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
       Do                          Sol
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe
     Re
Oooooooooh

Mim
Sidewalks we crossed
Do                              Sol         
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Re
over all the noise
        Mim
God I'm so blue, know we're through
    Do                          Sol
But I still fuckin' love you, babe
     Re
Oooooooooh


Do
I know we weren't perfect
                                 Sol
but I've never felt this way for no one
    Do
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay
         Sol

      Do                     Re                  Mim7
Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street</pre>]
