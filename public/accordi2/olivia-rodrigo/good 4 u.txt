Well good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
Fa#m                        Mi
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Fa#m                       Mi                       Re  Do#7
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world
Fa#m                            Mi
And good for you, I guess that you've been working on yourself
Fa#m                      Mi
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Fa#m                     Mi                      Re   Do#7
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl

You're doing great out there without me, baby

I've lost my mind
               Mi
I've spent the night
                       Fa#m  Mi  Re
Crying on the floor of my  bathroom
                  La                      Mi
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
                     Fa#m  Mi

Well good for you, I guess you're getting everything you want
Fa#m                           Mi
You bought a new car and your career's really taking off
Fa#m                     Mi
It's like we never even happened, baby
         Re               Do#7
What the fuck is up with that?
Fa#m                             Mi
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Fa#m                        Mi
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Fa#m
Person who ever got you
       Mi
Well, screw that and screw you
Re                               Do#7
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

Maybe I'm too emotional
         Fa#m             Mi        Si
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
