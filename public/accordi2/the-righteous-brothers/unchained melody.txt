Oh,  my love, my darling, I've hungered for your touch
Lam           Sol
A long, lonely time
    Do     Lam        Fa          Sol           Do
And time goes by so slowly and time can do so  much
Lam            Sol

Fa             Sol           Fa           Re#
Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
Fa           Sol           Do
To the open arms of the sea
Fa             Sol              Fa            Re#
Lonely rivers sigh, wait for me, wait for me
Fa              Sol          Do
I'll be coming home, wait for me

Oh, my love, my darling, I've hungered, hungered for your touch
Lam               Sol
A long, lonely time.
    Do         Lam     Fa           Sol              Do
And time goes by, so slowly, and time can do so much,
