Some people think that the physical things
  Solmaj7  Lam7     Sim7
Define what's within
Solmaj7             Lam7
I've been there before
     Sim7          Lam7
But that life's a bore
   Solmaj7       Lam7     Sim7
So full of the superficial


            Domaj7
Some people want it all
                 Sim7
But I don't want nothing at all
            Lam7
If it ain't you baby

If I ain't got you baby
                 Domaj7
Some people want diamond rings
               Sim7
Some just want everything
                     Lam7 
But everything means nothing 
               Solmaj7
If I ain't got you

Some people search for a fountain
Lam7                           Re7
Promises forever young
Solmaj7                        Sol#dim
Some people need three dozen roses
Lam7                               Re7
And that's the only way to prove you love them


Solmaj7       Lam7            Sim7      Lam7
Hand me the world on a silver plater
  Solmaj7  Lam7     Sim7
And what good would it be  
Solmaj7             Lam7
No one to share
Sim7        Lam7   Solmaj7 Lam7 Sim7
No one who truly cares for me
