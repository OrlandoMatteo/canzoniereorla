Moment of honesty
                 Do
Someone's gotta take the lead tonight
          Fa
Whose it gonna be?

I'm gonna sit right here
                      Lam
And tell you all that comes to me
               Do
If you have something to say
                   Fa
You should say it right now
You ready?


Lam                           Do            Fa
You give me a feeling that I never felt before

And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
Lam                              Do             Fa
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it


                Lam
I was wondering maybe
                     Do
Could I make you my baby
               Fa
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look 
crazy
                   Lam        Do
If you ask me I'm ready
                   Fa
If you ask me I'm ready


                 Lam
I know you once said to me
           Do                                
"This is exactly how it should feel when it's 
  Fa
meant to be"
                                       Lam
Time is only wasting so why wait for eventually?
           Do
If we gon' do something 'bout it
                 Fa
We should do it right now


Lam                           Do            Fa
You give me a feeling that I never felt before

And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
Lam                              Do             Fa

                    Lam                       Do
Or would it be so beautiful either way I'm sayin'
                   Fa
If you ask me I'm ready
                   Lam    Do    Fa
If you ask me I'm ready


Rem                                Mim
Why give up before we try
                                  Lam
Feel the lows before the highs
                                  Fa
Clip our wings before we fly away
Rem                                Mim
I can't say I came prepared
                                  Lam 
I'm suspended in the air
                                     Fa
Won't you come be in the sky with me
