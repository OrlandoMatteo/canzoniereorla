Hotter than a fantasy, lonely like a highway

She's living in a world, and it's on fire
Do                        Re
Filled with catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away

Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
                                           Re
Watch her when she's lighting up the night
             Sol                Mim
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
               Sim
And it's a lonely world
