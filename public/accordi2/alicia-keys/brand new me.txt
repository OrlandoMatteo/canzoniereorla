Rem            Sol            Lam
It's been a while, I'm not who I was before
Rem           Sol                       Lam
You look surprised, your words don't burn me anymore
Rem               Sol              Lam
Been meaning to tell you, but I guess it's clear to see
          Fa                  Fam               Do
Don't be mad, it's just the brand new kind of me
         Fa               Fam                Do
Can't be bad, I found a brand new kind of free

Oh, it took a long long time to get here
           Mim           Lam      Sol
It took a brave, brave girl to try
         Fa             Sol       Mi            Lam
It took one too many excuses, one too many lies
Sol            Fa                     Fam
Don't be surprised, don't be surprised

             Fa               Fam                Do
