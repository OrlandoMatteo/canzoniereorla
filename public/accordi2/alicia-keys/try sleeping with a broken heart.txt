Even if you were a million miles away
              La#
I could still feel you in my bed

Near me, touch me, feel me
    Do                        Fa
And even at the bottom of the sea
              La#
I could still hear inside my head

Tellin' me, touch me, feel me
            Do                       Fa   La#
And all the time you were tellin' me lies

Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart?
                    La#
Well, you could try sleeping in my bed

Lonely, own me nobody ever shut it down like you
             Do                 Rem7              La#
You wore the crown, you made my body feel heaven bound

Why don't you hold me, near me,

I thought you told me, you'd never leave me
               Do                   Fa
Looking in the sky I could see your face
           La#
And I know right where I fit in

Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love
     Do  Fa            La#
With you right til the end, oh

Anybody could've told you right from the start

It's about to fall apart

 So rather than hold on to a broken dream

Or just hold on to love

And I could find a way to make it
