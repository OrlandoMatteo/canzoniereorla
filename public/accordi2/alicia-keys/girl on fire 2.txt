 She's just a girl and she's on fire
Re                    Mi
 Hotter than a fantasy, lonely like a highway

 She's living in a world and it's on fire

And she's burning it down

 Hottest of the hottest girls say

'Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes

Watch her as she's lighting up the night
       La                 Fa#m
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
           Do#m
And it's a lonely world
