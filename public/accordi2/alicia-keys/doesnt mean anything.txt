       Mi  Do#m  La  Mi

Mi
 Used to dream of being a millionaire
                 Do#m
Without a care

But if I'm seeing my dreams
                                La
And you aren't there cause it’s over
                   Mi
That just won't be fair, darling

I'd rather be a poor woman living on the street
               Do#m
No food to eat

Cause I don't want no pie if I have to cry
            La                    Mi
Cause it's over when you said goodbye

       Mi          Si/Re# Do#m
All at once I had  it   all
                    La
But it doesn’t mean anything
                Mi
Now that you’re gone
                       Si/Re# Do#m
From above, seems I had it   all
                    La
But it doesn’t mean anything
             Mi
Since you’re gone

Mi
 Now I see myself through different eyes
                  Do#m
It's no surprise

but being alone would make you realize
          La                   Mi
When it's over all in love is fair

I shoulda been there, I shoulda been there

I shoulda shoulda

       Mi          Si/Re# Do#m
All at once I had  it   all
                    La
But it doesn’t mean anything
                Mi
Now that you’re gone
                       Si/Re# Do#m
From above, seems I had it   all
                    La
But it doesn’t mean anything
             Mi
Since you’re gone

Do#m7                 Si/Re#
 I know I pushed you away
                         Mi        La   Do#m7
What can I do that would save our love
                     Si/Re#
Take these material things

They don't mean nothing
      Mi        Fa#m
It's you that I want

       Mi          Si/Re# Do#m
All at once I had  it   all
                    La
But it doesn’t mean anything
                Mi
Now that you’re gone
                       Si/Re# Do#m
From above, seems I had it   all
                    La
But it doesn’t mean anything
             Mi
Since you’re gone

       Mi          Si/Re# Do#m
All at once I had  it   all
                    La
But it doesn’t mean anything
                Mi
Now that you’re gone
                       Si/Re# Do#m
From above, seems I had it   all
                    La
But it doesn’t mean anything
             Mi    Do#m  La  Mi
Since you’re gone
