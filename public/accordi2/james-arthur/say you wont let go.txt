[<pre>Sol Re Mim Do


Sol
I met you in the dark
Re
You lit me up
Mim
You made me feel as though
Do
I was enough

Sol
We danced the night away
Re
We drank too much
Mim
I held your hair back when
Do
You were throwing up


Sol
Then you smiled over your shoulder
Re
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
Mim                        Do
I pulled you closer to my chest

Sol
And you asked me to stay over
Re
I said, I already told ya
Mim                               Do
I think that you should get some rest


Sol
I knew I loved you then
Re
But you'd never know
Mim
Cause I played it cool when I was 
Do
Scared of letting go

Sol
I know I needed you
Re
But I never showed
Mim
But I wanna stay with you
Do
Until we're grey and old

Sol                       Re
Just say you won't let go
Mim                      Do
Just say you won't let go


Sol
I wake you up with some
Re
Breakfast in bed
Mim
I'll bring you coffee with a
Do
kiss on your head

Sol
And I'll take the kids to school
Re
Wave them goodbye
Mim
And I'll thank my lucky stars for 
Do
That night


Sol
When you looked over your shoulder
Re
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
Mim                           Do
I wanna dance with you right now, oh

Sol
And you look as beautiful as ever
Re
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
Mim                          Do
You make me feel this way somehow


Sol
I'm so in love with you
Re
And I hope you know
Mim
Darling your love is more than
Do
Worth its weight in gold

Sol
We've come so far my dear
Re
Look how we've grown
Mim
And I wanna stay with you
Do
Until we're grey and old

Sol                      Re
Just say you won't let go
Mim                     Do
Just say you won't let go


Sol
I wanna live with you
Re
Even when we're ghosts
Mim
Cause you were always there for me
Do
When I needed you most


Sol
I'm gonna love you till
Re
My lungs give out
Mim
I promise till death we part
Do
Like in our vows

Sol
So I wrote this song for you
Re
Now everybody knows
Mim
That it's just you and me
Do
Until we're grey and old


Sol                      Re
Just say you won't let go
Mim                     Do
Just say you won't let go

Sol                      Re
Just say you won't let go
Mim                         Do
Oh, just say you won't let go
