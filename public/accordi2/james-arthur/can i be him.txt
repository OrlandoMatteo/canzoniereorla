       Si  Si/La#  Miadd9

Si                  Si/La#
You walked into the room
                        Miadd9
And now my heart's been stolen
Si                  Si/La#               Miadd9
You took me back in time to when I was unbroken
                  Sol#m
Now you're all I want
               Fa#                 Miadd9
And I knew it from the very first moment
                   Sol#m                 Fa#
'Cause a light came on when I heard that song
                  Miadd9
And I want you to sing it again

Si                 Fa#
I swear that every word you sing
               Miadd9
You wrote them for me
     Si               Fa#
Like it was a private show
                     Miadd9
But I know you never saw me
                     Sol#m7           Fa#
When the lights come on and I'm on my own
                     Miadd9         Mi6
Will you be there to sing it again?
      Si                Fa#                   Miadd9
Could I be the one you talk about in all your stories?
         Si
Can I be him?

Si                  Si/La#                      Miadd9
I heard there was someone but I know he don't deserve you
Si                    Si/La#           Miadd9
If you were mine I'd never let anyone hurt you
                   Sol#m7           Fa#
I wanna dry those tears, kiss those lips
                        Miadd9
It's all that I've been thinking about
                    Sol#m7               Fa#
'Cause a light came on when I heard that song
                  Miadd9
And I want you to sing it again

Si                 Fa#
I swear that every word you sing
               Miadd9
You wrote them for me
     Si               Fa#
Like it was a private show
                     Miadd9
But I know you never saw me
                     Sol#m7           Fa#
When the lights come on and I'm on my own
                     Miadd9
Will you be there to sing it again?
      Si                Fa#                   Miadd9
Could I be the one you talk about in all your stories?

             Mimaj7  Re#7
Can I be the one?
             Sol#m7  Simaj7
Can I be the one?
             Mimaj7  Re#7
Can I be the one?
    Sol#m7       Fa#/La#
Oh, can I, can I be him?

          Si           Si/La#
Won't you sing it again
             Miadd9
Oh, when you sing it again

Can I be him
          Si           Si/La#
Won't you sing it again
             Miadd9
Oh, when you sing it again

Can I be him

Si                 Fa#
I swear that every word you sing
               Miadd9
You wrote them for me

Can I be him?
         Miadd9  Siadd9
Can I be him?
