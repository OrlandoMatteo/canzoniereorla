       La#  Fa  Solm7  Re#

La#
 I met you in the dark
Fa
 You lit me up
Solm7
 You made me feel as though
Re#
 I was enough
La#
 We danced the night away
Fa
 We drank too much
Solm7
 I held your hair back when
Re#
 You were throwing up
La#
 Then you smiled over your shoulder
Fa
 For a minute I was stone-cold sober
Solm7                     Re#
 I pulled you closer to my chest
La#
 And you asked me to stay over
Fa
 I said, I already told you
Solm7                          Re#
 I think that you should get some rest

La#
 I knew I loved you then
Fa
 But you'd never know
Solm7
 'Cause I played it cool when
Re#
 I was scared of letting go
La#
 I knew I needed you
Fa
 But I never showed
Solm7
 But I wanna stay with you
  Re#
Until we're grey and old
     La#                Fa/La
Just say you won't let go
     Solm7              Re#
Just say you won't let go

La#
 I wake you up with some
Fa/La
 Breakfast in bed
Solm7
 I'll bring you coffee
   Re#
With a kiss on your head
   La#
And I'll take the kids to school
Fa
 Wave them goodbye
Solm7
 And I'll thank my lucky stars
Re#
 For that night
La#
 When you looked over your shoulder
Fa
 For a minute I forget that I'm older
Solm7                       Re#
 I wanna dance with you right now, oh
  La#
And you look as beautiful as ever
Fa
 And I swear that every day you get better
Solm7                       Re#
 You make me feel this way somehow

La#
 I'm so in love with you
Fa/La
 And I hope you know
Solm7                            Re#
 Darling, your love is more than worth its weight in gold
La#
 We've come so far, my dear
Fa/La
 Look how we've grown
Solm7
 And I wanna stay with you
  Re#
Until we're grey and old
     La#                Fa/La
Just say you won't let go
     Solm7              Re#
Just say you won't let go

La#
 I wanna live with you
Fa
 Even when we're ghosts
Solm7
 'Cause you were always there for me
     Re#
When I needed you most

La#
 I'm gonna love you 'til
Fa
 My lungs give out
Solm7
 I promise 'til death we part
Re#
Like in our vows
La#
 So I wrote this song for you
Fa/La
 Now everybody knows
Solm7
 That it's just you and me
  Re#
Until we're grey and old
     La#                Fa/La
Just say you won't let go
     Solm7               Re#
Just say you won't let go
     La#                Fa/La
Just say you won't let go
         Solm7               Re#   La#
Oh, just say you won't let go
