  There is freedom within,   there is freedom without
Fa                                    Mi     La5 La5
  Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup
Dosus2                     Lasus2
  There's a battle ahead,   many battles are lost
Fa                           
  But you'll never see the end of the road
             Mi               Mi
while you're travelling with me


Fa        Sol             Do          Lam
Hey now, hey now Don't dream it's over
Fa        Sol                Do           Lam
Hey now, hey now When the world comes in
Fa          Sol         Do                 Lam
They come, they come   To build a wall between us
Fa                      Fa   Sol
We know they won't win


Dosus2                   Lasus2
  Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
Fa                                             Mi
  My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
Dosus2                Lasus2
  In the paper today  tales of war and of waste
Fa                                     Mi
  But you turn right over to the T.V. page


Fa        Sol             Do          Lam
Hey now, hey now Don't dream it's over
Fa        Sol                Do           Lam
Hey now, hey now When the world comes in
Fa          Sol         Do                 Lam
They come, they come   To build a wall between us
Fa
We know they won't win

Dosus2                   Lasus2
  Now I'm walking again   to the beat of a drum
Fa                                   Mi
  And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Dosus2                     Lasus2
  Only the shadows ahead   barely clearing the roof
Fa                                          Mi
 Get to know the feeling of liberation and release

Hey now, hey now Don't dream it's over

Hey now, hey now When the world comes in
Fa          Sol         Do                 Lam
They come, they come   To build a wall between us
Fa 
 We know that they won't win


Fa Sol Do Lam 
Don't let them win
Hey now, hey now</pre>]
