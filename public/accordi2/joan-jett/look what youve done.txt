Do                     Sol
 Take my photo off the wall
                 Lam      Do/Sol  Fa
If it just won't sing for you
Do                               Sol
'Cause all that's left has gone away
                    Lam       Do/Sol  Re
And there's nothing there for you to prove

Fa                    Sol
Oh, look what you've done
              Do      Mim/Si  Lam  Sol
You've made a fool of every---one
Fa                           Sol
Oh well, it seems likes such fun
          Do        Mim/Si  Lam  Sol  Re
Until you lose what you had won

Do                        Sol
 Give me back my point of view
                    Lam        Do/Sol  Fa
'Cause I just can't think for you
Do                    Sol
 I can hardly hear you say
              Lam  Do/Sol   Re
What should I do, well you choose

Fa                   Sol
Oh, look what you've done
              Do      Mim/Si  Lam  Sol
You've made a fool of every---one
Fa                           Sol
Oh well, it seems likes such fun
          Do        Mim/Si  Lam  Sol  Re
Until you lose what you had won

You've made a fool of everyone
