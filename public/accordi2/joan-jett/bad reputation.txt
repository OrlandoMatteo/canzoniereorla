I don't give a damn about my reputation

You're living in the past, it's a new generation
       Mi                   Fa#
Hey, a girl can do what she wants to do
    Mi              Si    Fa#
And that's what I'm gonna do
                                                Si Mi Fa# Si
And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation
   Si Mi Fa# Si
Oh no
    Si Mi Fa# Si
Not me

                                           Si
And I don't give a damn about my reputation

I never said I wanted to improve my station
        Mi                         Fa#
And I'm only feeling good when I'm having fun
      Mi            Si        Fa#
And I don't have to please no one
                                               Si Mi Fa# Si
And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation
   Si Mi Fa# Si
Oh no
    Si Mi Fa# Si
Not me
   Si Mi Fa# Si
Oh no
    Si Mi Fa# Si
Not me

Do#
And I don't give a damn about my reputation

I've never been afraid of any deviation
      Fa#               Sol#
And I don't really care if I'm strange
  Fa#   Do#   Sol#
I ain't gonna change
                                               Do# Fa# Sol# Do#
And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation
   Do# Fa# Sol# Do#
Oh no
    Do# Fa# Sol# Do#
Not me
   Do# Fa# Sol# Do#
Oh no
    Do# Fa# Sol# Do#
Not me

Do#

                                            Do#
And I don't give a damn about my reputation

The world's in trouble, there's no communication
    Fa#                        Sol#
And everyone can say what they want to say
   Fa#        Do#       Sol#
It never gets better anyway
   Do#                                     Do# Fa# Sol# Do#
So why should I care about a bad reputation,   anyway
   Do# Fa# Sol# Do#
Oh no
    Do# Fa# Sol# Do#
Not me
   Do# Fa# Sol# Do#
Oh no
    Do# Fa# Sol# Do#
Not me..
