Come on skinny love, just last the year
Lam             Fa                    Do
Pour a little salt, we were never here
        Lam        Fa                     Do
My my my - my my my - my my my my - my my ...
               Rem                        Lam
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
Lam        Fa                Do
I tell my love to wreck it all
Lam              Fa                Do
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
        Lam        Fa                    Do
My my my - my my my - my my my my my
             Rem                 Lam
Right in the moment this order's tall


  Do                         Mim            Lam
I told you to be patient, I told you to be fine
  Do                          Mim            Lam
I told you to be balanced, I told you to be kind
         Do
In the morning I'll be with you
            Mim              Lam
But it will be a different kind
          Do
I'll be holding all the tickets
               Mim            Lam
And you'll be owning all the fines


Lam            Fa                  Do
Come on skinny love, what happened here
Lam            Fa                  Do
Suckle on the hope in lite brassiere
        Lam        Fa                  Do
My my my - my my my - my my my - my my ...
        Rem                          Lam
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split


   Do                         Mim           Lam
I told you to be patient, I told you to be fine
   Do                         Mim            Lam
I told you to be balanced, I told you to be kind
     Do                            Mim             Lam
Now all your love is wasted, then who the hell was I?
                Do
Cause now I'm breaking at the britches
           Mim              Lam
And at the end of all your lines


Do                  Mim         Lam
Who will love you? Who will fight?
Do                  Mim      Lam
And who will fall, far behind?
Lam             Fa           Do   
Come on skinny love ........
        Lam        Fa                     Do
My my my - my my my - my my my - my my ...
        Lam        Fa                     Do
My my my - my my my - my my my - my my ...
