 They wanted me here just to show you my face
                                                  La#6   Rem
But when it comes to the crunch, I just hide in disgrace
                                              La#6   Rem
You were calling me mad but I know you're the same
                                           La#6  Lam
'Cause you gotta be seen to be playing the game
                                    Solm       Rem
Yes, you gotta be seen to be playing the game

It ain't gonna hurt now if you open up your eyes
                                 Solm          Do   Rem
You're making it worse now every time you criticize
                                Solm          Do
I'm under your curse now, but I call it compromise
  Lam7                            Sol
I thought that you were wise, but you were otherwise

 A specimen like you I would love to obtain
                                           La#6   Rem
I asked a tedious guy if he'd tell me your name
                                         La#6   Rem
I'd love to impress you with a back somersault
                                                La#6  Lam
I wanna take up your love, but it's locked in a vault

 When I open my mouth, I'm so brutally honest
      Do                                Rem    Solm
And I can't expect that kind of love from you
                   La#7                              Rem
When you open your mouth, your teeth are beautifully polished
      Do                                 Rem
And I can't extract the pain you're going through
      Lam7              Sol
No, I can't explain the pain you're going through
