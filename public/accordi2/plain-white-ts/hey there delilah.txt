Do
  Hey there Delilah,
          Mim
What’s it like in New York City? 
      Do
I’m a thousand miles away, 
           Mim
But girl tonight you look so pretty, 
        Lam   Sol
Yes you do, 
Fa                   Sol                  Lam
  Time Square can’t shine as bright as you, 
             Sol
I swear it’s true. 
Do
  Hey there Delilah, 
          Mim
Don’t you worry about the distance, 
          Do
I’m right there if you get lonely, 
          Mim
Give this song another listen, 
           Lam     Sol
Close your eyes, 
Fa              Sol                Lam
  Listen to my voice it’s my disguise, 
            Sol
I’m by your side. 


Do                      Lam
Oh it’s what you do to me, 
Do                      Lam
Oh it’s what you do to me, 
Do                      Lam
Oh it’s what you do to me, 
Do                      Lam
Oh it’s what you do to me, 
               Do
What you do to me.


Do
  Hey there Delilah,
       Mim
I know times are getting hard, 
           Do
But just believe me girl some day, 
             Mim
I'll pay the bills with this guitar, 
              Lam     Sol
We'll have it good, 
Fa                Sol               Lam
  We'll have the life we knew we would, 
           Sol
My word is good.

Do
  Hey there Delilah, 
         Mim
I’ve got so much left to say, 
         Do
If every simple song I wrote to you, 
      Mim
Would take your breath away, 
             Lam    Sol
I’d write it all, 
Fa              Sol                  Lam
  Even more in love with me you’d fall, 
             Sol
We’d have it all.


Do                      Lam
Oh it’s what you do to me, 
Do                      Lam
Oh it’s what you do to me, 
Do                      Lam
Oh it’s what you do to me, 
Do                      Lam
Oh it’s what you do to me, 


  Fa
A thousand miles seems pretty far, 
    Sol
But they’ve got planes and trains and cars, 
    Do                             Lam
I’d walk to you if I had no other way, 
    Fa
Our friends would all make fun of us, 
    Sol
And we'll just laugh along because, 
   Do                                     Lam
We know that none of them have felt this way, 
  Fa
Delilah I can promise you, 
     Sol
That by the time that we get through, 
    Lam
The world will never ever be the same,
              Sol
And you’re to blame.


Do                          Mim
  Hey there Delilah you be good, And don’t you miss me, 
         Do
Two more years and you’ll be done with school, 
    Mim
And I'll be making history, 
       Lam   Sol
Like I do, 
Fa                  Sol              Lam
  You’ll know it's all because of you, 
Fa               Sol            Lam
  We can do whatever we want to,
Fa             Sol               Lam
  Hey there Delilah here's to you, 
               Sol
This one’s for you.


Do                      Lam
Oh it’s what you do to me,
Do                      Lam
Oh it’s what you do to me,
Do                      Lam
Oh it’s what you do to me,
Do                      Lam
Oh it’s what you do to me,
               Do       Lam
What you do to me.
