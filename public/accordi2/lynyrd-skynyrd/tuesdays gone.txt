 Train roll on, on down the line,
         La              Mi   Re    La
Won't you please take me far away?
                    Mi  Fa#m        Re
Now I feel the wind blow outside my door,
          La              Mi       Re     La
Means I'm, I'm leaving my woman at home

          Sol           Re    La
Tuesday's gone with the wind
          Mi            Re    La  Mi  Fa#m  Re
My baby's gone with the wind again

La            Mi  Fa#m        Re     La
 And I don't know   where I'm going
               Mi       Re    La
I just want to be left alone
                      Mi  Fa#m        Re    La
Well, when this train ends  I'll try again,
                   Mi       Re    La
But I'm leaving my woman at home

          Sol           Re    La

 Train roll on   many miles from my home,
   La              Mi     Re   La
See, I'm riding my blues away
             Mi  Fa#m           Re   La
Tuesday, you see, she had to be free
                 Mi           Re   La
But somehow I've got to carry on

My baby's gone with the wind...
