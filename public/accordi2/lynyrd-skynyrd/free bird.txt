Sol      Re/Fa#          Mim
If I leave here to morrow
Fa           Do              Re4
Would you still remember me
Sol            Re/Fa#         Mim
For I must be travelin' on now
Fa                        Do                  Re4
'Cause there's too many places I've got to see
Sol          Re/Fa#           Mim
But if I stay here with you girl
Fa             Do               Re4
Things just couldn't be the same
Sol              Re/Fa#      Mim
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
Fa          Do               Re4
And this bird you cannot change, oh


Fa         Do               Re4
And the bird you cannot cha-ange
Fa          Do               Re4 Re
And this bird you cannot cha - ange
Fa       Do            Re4  Re
Lord knows I can't cha  - ange

Bye, bye, baby, it's been a sweet love, yeah, yeah
Fa             Do               Re4
Though this feeling I can't change
Sol                  Re/Fa#       Mim
But please don't take it so badly
Fa            Do            Re4
'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame
Sol          Re/Fa#           Mim
But if I stay here with you, girl
Fa             Do               Re4
Things just couldn't be the same

And this bird you'll never change, oh

And the bird you cannot change
Fa          Do               Re4
And this bird you cannot change

Lord knows I can't cha     ange
Fa       Do                Re4
Lord, help me, I can't cha-a-a-a-ange
