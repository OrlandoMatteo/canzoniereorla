  I knew a girl   Her name was truth
Dom          La#m     Sol#
  She was, a horrible liar
Sol#                  La#m
  She couldn't spend,   one day alone
        Dom          La#m      Sol#
But she couldn't, be satisfied
Sol#             La#m
  When you have,   everything
         Dom      La#m   Sol#
You have every__thing to lose
Sol#                La#m
  She made herself,   a bed of nails
          Dom            La#m          Sol#
And she's planning, o__n putting it to use

            Fa#      Do#    Sol#
But she had diamonds on the inside
        Fa#      Do#    Sol#
She had diamonds on the inside

  Sol#                             La#m
A candle throws its light into the darkness
     Dom             La#m           Sol#
In a nasty world, so shines, a good deed
Sol#                     La#m
  Make sure the fortune,   that you seek
       Dom     La#m      Sol#
Is the fortune that, you need
Sol#           La#m
  Tell me why,   the first to ask
       Dom          La#m       Sol#
Is the last, one to give every time
Sol#                       La#m
  What you 're saying, and do not mean
Dom     La#m           Sol#
Follow..s you, close behind

Like the soldier long standing, under fire
Dom         La#m         Sol#
Any change, comes as a relief
        Sol#                  La#m
Let the givers name remain unspoken
Dom               La#m  Sol#
She is just a generous  thief
