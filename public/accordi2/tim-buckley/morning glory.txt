Sol#                    Do#maj7
 I lit my purest candle close to my
Sol#                   Do#maj7
 Window, hoping it would catch the eye
Sol#                Do#maj7
 Of any vagabond who passed it by
La#m7             Do#      Sol#
 And I waited in my fleeting house
                       Do#maj7
Before he came I felt him drawing near
Sol#                      Do#maj7
 As he neared I felt the ancient fear
Sol#                        Do#maj7
 That he had come to wound my door and jeer
La#m7              Do#       Sol#
 And I waited in my fleeting house
Re#                  Do#add9  Sol#/Do   Do#maj7
 "Tell me stories," I called  to   the Hobo
Re#                  Do#add9  Sol#/Do  Do#maj7
 "Stories of cold," I smiled  at  the Hobo
Re#                  Do#add9 Sol#/Do  Do#maj7
 "Stories of old," I knelt   to  the Hobo
La#m11                 Do#       Sol#
 And he stood before my  fleeting house

Sol#                        Do#maj7
 "No," said the Hobo, "No more tales of time
Sol#                        Do#maj7
 Don't ask me now to wash away the grime
Sol#                Do#maj7
  I can't come in 'cause it's too high a climb"
La#m7                     Do#        Sol#
 And he walked away from my fleeting house
Re#                    Do#add9    Sol#/Do Do#maj7
 "Then you be damned!" I screamed to the Hobo
Re#                  Do#add9 Sol#/Do Do#maj7
 "Leave me alone," I wept    to the Hobo
Re#                   Do#add9 Sol#/Do Do#maj7
 "Turn into stone," I knelt   to the Hobo
La#m11                    Do#       Sol#
 And he walked away from my  fleeting house
