Mi            Si                La
 Long afloat on shipless oceans
            Do#m           Si Mi
I did all my best to smile
                 Si                La
'til your singing eyes and fingers
              Do#m
Drew me loving to your isle
Mi
 And you sang
Re
 Sail to me
La/Do#
 Sail to me
         Mi
Let me enfold you
Do#m
 Here I am   Here I am
Si           La
  Waiting to hold you

Mi              Si                 La
 Did I dream you dreamed about me?
                 Do#m          Mi
Were you hare when I was fox?
             Si                 La
Now my foolish boat is leaning
               Mi
Broken lovelorn on your rocks,
             Re               La/Do#
For you sing, 'touch me not,
                          Mi        Do#m
touch me not, come back tomorrow
                      Si              La
O my heart, o my heart shies from the sorrow'

Mi4 Mi   Mi4/Re Mi/Re  La/Do# Do#m

Mi           Si                    La
 I am puzzled as the newborn child
             Do#m          Mi
I am troubled at the tide
              Si                  La
Should I stand amid the breakers?
                 Do#m             Mi
Should I lie with death my bride?
             Re          La/Do#                 Mi
Hear me sing, 'swim to me, swim to me, let me enfold you
Do#m                 Si           La        Mi
 Here I am, here I am, waiting to hold you'
