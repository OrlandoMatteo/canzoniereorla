He is jealous for me,
Lam7
Loves like a hurricane, I am a tree,
Sol                                          Famaj7
Bending beneath the weight of his wind and mercy.
Do
When all of a sudden,
                      Lam7
I am unaware of these afflictions eclipsed by glory,
      Sol
And I realize just how beautiful You are,
        Famaj7
And how great Your affections are for me.


    Do                   Lam7
And oh, how He loves us oh
          Sol
Oh how He loves us,
                Famaj7
How He loves us all

We are His portion and He is our prize,
Lam7
Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes,
Sol                               Famaj7
If grace is an ocean, we’re all sinking.
Do
So Heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss,
Lam7
And my heart turns violently inside of my chest,
Sol
I don’t have time to maintain these regrets,
Famaj7
When I think about, the way…

Oh how He loves us,

Oh how He loves us oh.</pre>]
