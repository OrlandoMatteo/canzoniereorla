Mi/Si            Si
I searched the world
    Mi/Si         Si
But it couldn’t fill me
             Sol#m
Man’s empty praise
                   Fa#
and treasures that fade
           Mi
Are never enough


               Si
Then You came along
Mi/Si                Si
And put me back together
           Sol#m               Fa#
And every desire is now satisfied
             Mi
Here in Your love


            Si
Oh there’s nothing better than You
        Sol#m
There’s nothing better than You
              Mi
Lord there’s nothing, nothing is better
     Si
than You

Third  Verse
         Si
I’m not afraid
   Mi              Si
To show You my weakness
                Sol#m
My failures and flaws
                      Fa#
Lord You’ve seen them all
                      Mi
And You still call me friend


                       Si
‘Cause the God of the mountain
       Do#m         Si
Is the God of the valley
              Sol#m
There’s not a place
               Fa#
Your mercy and grace
              Mi
Won’t find me again

  You turn mourning to dancing
                          Mi  Si
You give beauty for ashes
You turn shame into glory

You’re the only one who can (repeat line)

You turn bones into armies
You turn seas into highways
