 They haven't changed, haven't had much to say,
La#m7                   Do#/Re#
But man I still think those cats are crazy
Sol#5                    Dom7
 They were askimg me if you were around,
Do#                    Mi
How you was, and where you could be found,

 Driving all the old men crazy

 Remember that chick who used to dance a lot?
Do#                Fa7sus4
 Every night on the floor she'll be shaking what she got,
Dom7                  Fa7sus4
 Man I tell you she was cool, she was red hot
La#5           Do#/Re#
 I mean, she was steaming
Sol#                     Dom7
 That one time over at Jonny's place,
Do#                    Mi
 That chick got up and slapped Jonny's face,
Dom7               Fa7sus4
 Man we just fell about the place,
La#m7                                  Do#/Re#
 And if that girl don't want to know, forget her

 Friday night they'll be dressed to kill,
Do#             Fa7sus4
 Down at Tino's bar and grill,
Dom7                          Fa7sus4
 The drinks will flow and the blood will spill,
La#m7                              Do#/Re#
 And if those boys want to fight, you'd better let 'em
Sol#                         Dom7
 The jutebox in the corner blasting out my favorite song,
Do#                      Mi
 The nights are getting warmer and it won't be long,
Dom7                Fa7sus4
 It won't belong till summer comes,
La#m7                    Do#/Re#
 Now that those boys are here again
