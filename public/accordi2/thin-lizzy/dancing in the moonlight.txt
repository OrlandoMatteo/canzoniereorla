       Mim7              Re
When I passed you in the doorway
         Do               Sol
Well you took me with a glance
Mim7                        Re
 I should have took that last bus home
      Do                 Sol
But I asked you for a dance
       Mim7             Re
Now we go steady to the pictures
         Do                      Sol
I always get chocolate stains on my pants
Mim7                Re
 And my father he's going crazy
        Do                 Sol
He says I'm living in a trance

        Sim            Mim7      Re
But I'm dancing in the moonlight
                      Do
It's caught me in its spotlight
     Sol
It's alright, alright

     Mim7                 Re
It's three o'clock in the morning
        Do              Sol
And I'm on the streets again
Mim7                 Re
 I disobeyed another warning
  Do                     Sol
I should have been in by ten
      Mim7            Re
Now I won't get out until Sunday
          Do                   Sol
I'll have to say I stayed with friends
Mim7               Re
 But it's a habit worth forming
      Do                   Sol
If it means to justify the end
