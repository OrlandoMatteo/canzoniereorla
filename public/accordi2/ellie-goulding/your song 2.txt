                  Sol     Do                    Sol
It's a little bit funny      this feeling in - side
Mim                 Sol             Do         Sol    Sol/Fa#
    I'm not one of those who can      easily hide
Mim                    Sol     Do                Sol
    I don't have much money      but, boy if I did
              Lam           Do                  Re
I'd buy a big house where      we both could live



Mim                     Sol       Do                      Sol
    So excuse me for â€“ getting      but, these things I do
Mim                     Sol                 Do                   Sol    Sol/Fa#
    You see I've for - gotten if they're      green or they're blue
Mim             Sol        Do                Sol
    Anyway the thing is      what I really mean
              Lam             Do              Re
Yours are the sweetest eyes      I've ever seen


Re                 Mim         Lam               Do
And you can tell everybody      this is your song
Re                 Mim           Lam                 Do
   It may be quite  simple but      now that it's done
Mim
    I hope you don't mind
Sol                         La                     Do
    I hope you don't mind     that I put down in words
    Sol        Lam            Do            Re
How wonderful life is while you're in the world


Mim             Sol        Do                 Sol
    If I was a sculptor,     but then again no
Mim                     Sol            Do            Sol    Sol/Fa#
    Or a girl who makes potions in a      traveling show
Mim                  Sol                 Do             Sol
    I know it's not much but it's the      best I can do
              Lam        Do                 Re
My gift is my song and      this one's for you


Lam  Sol  Lam  Mim  Lam  Sol  Lam  Sol
Lam  Sol  Lam  Mim  Lam  Sol  Lam  Mim  Re
