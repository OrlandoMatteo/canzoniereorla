           Sol                
You're the light, you're the night
           Sim7           
You're the color of my blood
           Mim7
You're the cure, you're the pain
                                    Do
You're the only thing I wanna touch
      Re                            Mim7
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much

           Sol          
You're the fear, I don't care
            Sim7             
'Cause I've never been so high
       Mim7
Follow me to the dark
                                    Do
Let me take you past our satellites
         Re                              Mim7
You can see the world you brought to life, to life

       Sol         
Fading in, fading out
       Sim7   
On the edge of paradise
      Mim7   
Every inch of your skin 
                                 Do
is a holy grail I've got to find
     Re                          Mim7
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire

           Sol                    Sim7
Yeah, I'll let you set the pace

'Cause I'm not thinking straight
   Do                     Re                        Mim7
My head spinning around I can't see clear no more
