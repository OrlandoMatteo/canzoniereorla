Do             Mi7              Lam
This is the first day of my life
Fa             Sol                 Do
Swear I was born right in the doorway
Do                   Mi7                        Lam
I went out in the rain, suddenly everything changed
                Re7              Sol        Sol7
They're spreading blankets on the beach

Do              Mi7                Lam
Yours is the first face that I saw
Fa             Sol              Do
Think I was blind before I met you
Do                        Mi7                          Lam
Now I don't know where I am, I don't know where I've been
           Re7              Sol      Sol7
But I know where I want to go


         Do           Sol       Lam
And so I thought I'd let you know
     Fa                 Sol
That these things take forever
    Do    Mi      Lam
I especially am slow
        Remadd9
But I realized that I need you and 
I wondered if I could come home

Do            Mi7                 Lam
Remember the time you drove all night
Fa        Sol             Do
Just to meet me in the morning
Do                    Mi7                           Lam
And I thought it was strange, you said everything changed
            Re7                 Sol     Sol7
You felt as if you'd just woke up
           Do               Mi7              Lam
And you said, "This is the first day of my life.
Fa                   Sol            Do
I'm glad I didn't die before I met you.
Do                Mi7                  Lam
But now I don't care, I could go anywhere with you,
        Re7            Sol        Sol7
And I'd probably be happy."


          Do       Sol       Lam
So if you want to be with me
     Fa                       Sol
With these things there's no telling
        Do       Mi         Lam
We just have to wait and see
                  Remadd9
But I'd rather be working for a paycheck

Than waiting to win the lottery

             Remadd9
Besides, maybe this time it's different,
                                Do
I mean I really think you like me
