Lam               Do              Fa
Gold teeth and a curse for this town
Do              Sol
Were all in my mouth
     Do            Fa            Lam   Sol
Only I don't know how they got out, dear
Lam             Do      Fa
Turn me back into the pet
Do             Sol
I was when we met
Do             Fa            Lam   Sol
I was happier then with no mind set


Sol                      Do
And if you'd a took to me like
  Fa    Do            Sol
A gull takes to the wind
            Sol           Do
Well, I'd a jumped from my tree
    Fa     Do               Fa           Do
And I'd a danced like the king of the eyesores
Fa                   Do             Sol
And the rest of our lives would'a fared well


Lam                 Do          Fa
New slang when you notice the stripes
Do                Sol
The dirt in your fries
     Do                   Fa
Hope it's right when you die
        Lam  Sol
Old and bo..ny
Lam                 Do                Fa
Dawn breaks like a bull through the hall
Do              Sol
Never should'a called
    Do               Fa
But my heads to the wall
        Lam  Sol
And I'm lonely


Sol                      Do
And if you'd a took to me like
  Fa    Do            Sol
A gull takes to the wind
            Sol           Do
Well, I'd a jumped from my tree
    Fa     Do               Fa           Do
And I'd a danced like the king of the eyesores
Fa                   Do             Sol
And the rest of our lives would'a fared well

Lam                Do          Fa
God speed all the baker's at dawn
             Do         Sol
May they all cut their thumbs
    Do                Fa
And bleed into their buns
           Lam   Sol
'Till they melt away


Sol                      Do
I'm looking in on the good life
           Fa      Do        Sol
I might be doomed never to find
                           Do
Without a trust or flaming fields
     Fa   Do       Sol
Am I too dumb to refine?
                       Do
And if you'd a took to me like
     Fa     Do               Fa            Do
Well I'd a danced like the queen of the eyesores
Fa                   Do             Sol
And the rest of our lives would'a fared well
