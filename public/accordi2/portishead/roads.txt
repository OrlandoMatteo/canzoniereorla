 Ohh, can't anybody see
            Lam          Sol
We've got a war to fight
                   Fa
Never found our way
         Mi               Fa
Regardless of what they say

How can it feel, this wrong

Lam     Sol6             Famaj7
  Storm.. in the morning light

No more can I say
      Mi7        Fa
Frozen to myself
                 Soladd9
I got nobody on my side
                   Lam7      Fa  Soladd9
And surely that ain't right
