Three little birds, sat on my window
Do/Re                                 Sol
And they told me I don't need to worry
Sol                     La7
Summer came like cinnamon

So sweet,
Do/Re                                 Sol
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

Maybe sometimes, we've got it wrong, but it's alright
     Domaj7                               Dommaj7
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same

Oh, don't you hesitate

Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
Do/Re                       Sol
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sol                         La7/Mi
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,
Do/Re                        Sol
Just go ahead, let your hair down
Domaj7                            Dommaj7         Sol
     You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow


Sol                La7
Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely,
Do/Re                              Sol
Sipping tea in a bar by the roadside,
                   Sol
(just relax, just relax)
                           La7
Don't you let those other boys fool you,
Do/Re                        Sol
Got to love that afro hair do

Mim7     Si7/Re#          Mim7                         La9
Maybe sometimes, we feel afraid, but it's alright
     Domaj7                               Dommaj7
The more you stay the same, the more they seem to change

Don't you think it's strange?

'Twas more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
Mim                        N.C.                          Lam7
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger

When you gonna realise, that you don't even have to try any longer?
