Sol5              Sol#5 Rem
 Let me tell you, I'm  vicious

Not pass-aggressive

I got my finger on my pulse,

staring straight into a hole and I get it

And I'm a savage

It's automatic

I got a way of making noise,

the power to destroy with no static
      La#        Solm
Cause victory is all you need
   Rem
So cultivate and plant the seed
La#                  Solm               Do
Hold your breath and count to ten, just count to ten

                  Rem
I'm gonna make it rain, so ring the bell

I know it all too well

Switchblade on the edge of your wrist

Can I get a witness? (Witness)
      La#          Solm
Cause agony brings no reward
    Rem              Do
For one more hit and one last score
      La#        Do
Don't be a casualty, cut the cord
 Rem
(Freedom, la la la la)

(Freedom, follow me) Cut the cord

Sol5       Sol#5 Rem
 You gotta feel courage

Embrace possession

If it was easier

to shatter everything that ever mattered

But it's not, because it's your obsession

Be a fighter, backbone, desire

Complicated and it stings,

but we both know what it means
                                Sol5
And it's time to get real and inspired
      La#        Solm
Cause victory is all you need
   Rem
So cultivate and plant the seed
La#                  Solm
Hold your breath and count to ten,
     Do
just count to ten, just count to ten

I'm gonna make it rain, so ring the bell

I know it all too well
