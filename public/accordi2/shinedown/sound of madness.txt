Rem
  ...Yeah, I get it

You're an outcast

Always under attack

Always coming in last

Bringing up the past

No one owes you anything

I think

You need a shotgun blast

A kick in the ass

So paranoid
                 Rem    Sol#5 Rem   Sol#5
Watch your back

Sol5   Fa5
Oh my, here we go
 Rem
Another loose cannon gone bi-polar

Slipped down, couldn't get much lower

Quicksand's got no sense of humor
Sol#                     Sol5
I'm still laughing like hell
Rem
You think that by crying to me

Looking so sorry that I'm gonna believe

You've been infected by a social disease

Well, then take your medicine

La#            Rem
 I created the sound of madness
Fa
Wrote the book on pain
            Do
Somehow I'm still here to explain
La#               Rem                      Fa
 That the darkest hour never comes in the night
                      Do
You can sleep with a gun
                           Sol#5   Rem   Sol#5 Rem   Sol#5
When you gonna wake up and fight...

Sol5   Fa5          Rem
I'm so sick of this tombstone mentality

If there's an afterlife

Then it'll set you free

But I'm not gonna part the seas
         Sol#5            Sol5  Fa5
You're a self-fulfilling prophecy
Rem
You think that by crying to me

Looking so sorry that I'm gonna believe

You've been infected by a social disease

Well, then take your medicine
