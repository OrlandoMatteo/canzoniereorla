Sim         Re     La             Sol Fa#
 I've got a candle, and I've got a spoon

 I live in a hallway with no doors and no rooms
Sim        Re        La              Sol Fa#
 Under the windowseel, they all were found
  Sim                  Re
A touch of concrete within the doorways,
La/Do#       Sim Fa#
 without a sound

Sim             Fa#m             La       Sol
Someone save me if you will, and take away
          Fa#
all these pills
    Sim                   Fa#m                La       Sol
And please, just save me, if you can, from my blasphemy
      Fa#
in my wasteland

It made me compromise
