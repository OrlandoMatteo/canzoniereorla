 One not simply, so absurd
Mim       Re/Fa#   Sol
 In these times of doing what you're told
Doadd9
 You keep these feelings, no one knows

Lam           Lam6        Mim
 What ever happened to the young man's heart
Lam           Lam6       Sol          Fa#5
 Swallowed by pain, as he slowly fell apart

        Mim                          Re
And I'm staring down the barrel of a 45,

Swimming through the ashes of another life
Mim                 Re
No real reason to accept the way things have changed

 Send a message to the unborn child

 Keep your eyes open, for a while
Mim   Re/Fa#   Sol            Doadd9
 In a box high up on the shelf, left for you, no one else
Mim         Re/Fa#    Sol
 There's a piece of a puzzle known as life
Doadd9
 Wrapped in guilt, sealed up tight

Everyone's pointing their fingers

Always condemning me
