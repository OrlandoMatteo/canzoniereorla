Freezin', rests his head on a pillow

made of concrete, again

Oh, feelin' maybe he'll see a little better,

set of days, ooh yeah

Oh, hand out, faces that he sees time

again ain't that familiar, oh yeah

Oh, dark grin, he can't help,

when he's happy looks insane, oh yeah

Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
    Re       La#                     Re Do
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Re      La#                  Re    Do
Someday yet, he'll begin his life again
Re    Do    Re    Do
Life again, life again...

Re
Kneelin', looking through the paper

though he doesn't know to read, ooh yeah

Oh, prayin', now to something

that has never showed him anything

Oh, feelin', understands the weather

of the winters on its way

Oh, ceilings, few and far between

all the legal halls of shame, yeah
