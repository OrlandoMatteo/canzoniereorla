     Mi  Laadd9  Mi  Laadd9

Mi              Laadd9            Mi        Laadd9
Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay
     Mi                La             Mi
Were laid spread out before me as her body once did

Mi         Laadd9           Mi             Laadd9
All five horizons revolved around her soul   as the earth to the sun
Mi            La                      Mi
Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn

      Do                              Mim
Hmmmm,  and all I taught her was everything
      Do                                 Mim
Hmmmm,  I know she gave me all that she wore

           Re
And now my bitter hands,
        Do
Chafe beneath the clouds
                 Mim
Of what was everything
        Re
Oh, the pictures
              Do
Have all been washed in black
              Mim
Tattooed everything

Mi         Laadd9              Mi                      Laadd9
  I take a walk outside I'm surrounded by some kids at play
Mi               La           Mi
I can feel their laughter so, why do I sear

      Do                                         Mim
Hmmmm,  and twisted thoughts that spin 'round my head, I'm spinning, oh
    Do                                   Mim
I'm spinning, How quick the sun can drop away

           Re
And now my bitter hands
       Do
Cradle broken glass
                 Mim
Of what was everything
        Re
All the pictures have
         Do
All been washed in black
              Mim
Tattooed everything
        Re
All the love gone bad
          Do
Turned my world to black
                 Re
And tattooed all I see,
         Do
All that I am,
         Mim
All I'll be

Re  Do    Mim     Re    Do
    Yeah  Uh huh  Uh huh

  Mim
I know someday you'll have a beautiful life,
  Re                       Do
I know you'll be a star in somebody elses sky
    Mim       Re           Do
But why, why, why can't it be,
                Mim    Re    Do
Why can't it be mine
