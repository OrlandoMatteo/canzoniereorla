     Do   Sol

Do                                             Sol
Yes, I understand that every life must end, uh-huh
Do                                             Sol
As we sit alone, I know someday we must go, uh-huh
   Do                                               Sol
Oh I'm a lucky man, to count on both hands the ones I love
Do                                                          Sol
Some folks just have one, yeah, others they've got none, uh-huh

Lam
  Stay with me... oh..
Fa
 Lets just breathe...


     Do   Sol

Do                                                Sol
Practiced all my sins, never gonna let me win, uh-huh
Do                                             Sol
Under everything, just another human being, uh-huh
Do                                                           Sol
I don't wanna hurt, there's so much in this world to make me bleed

Lam
  Stay with me... you're..
Fa
 All I see...

Sol                Rem
  Did I say that I need you?
Sol                Rem
  Did I say that I want you?
Fa                     Lam
Oh, if I didn't, I'm a fool you see
Rem          Do          Sol
No one knows this more than me
   Sol7
As I come clean...

  Do                                            Sol
I wonder everyday, as I look upon your face, uh-huh
Do                                                 Sol
Everything you gave and nothing you would take, oh no
Lam
Nothing you would take,
     Fa
everything you gave...

Sol                Rem
  Did I say that I need you?
Sol                Rem
  Did I say that I want you?
Fa                     Lam
Oh, if I didn't, I'm a fool you see
Rem          Do          Sol
No one knows this more than me
   Sol7
As I come clean...


     Do   Sol  Do  Sol

Lam
Nothing you would take,
     Fa
everything you gave...
Lam
Hold me 'till I die
         Fa
Meet you on the other side...
