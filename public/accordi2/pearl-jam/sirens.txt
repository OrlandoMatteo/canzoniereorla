Re#
 Hear the sirens
Dom
 Hear the sirens
Re#
 Hear the sirens,
                     Dom Do4 Dom Do4
Hear the circus so profound
 Re#
I  hear the sirens
                       Dom    Do4 Dom Do4
More and more in this here town
       La#
Let me catch my breath to breathe
           Re#       Solm  La#
And reach across the bed

Just to know we're safe
      Re#       Dom
I am a grateful man
    La#
The slightest bit of light
          Re#     Solm
And I can see you clear

Dom
Oh, have to take your hand
    Re#       La#
And feel your breath for fear
     Fam7               Dom
this someday will be over
           Re#               La#
I pull you close, so much to lose knowing
        Fam7             Re#/Sol Sol#
that nothing lasts forever
         Re#                  La#
I didn't care before you were here
                     Fam7            Re#/Sol Sol#
I danced in laughter with the everafter
               Re#
But all things change
           La#      Re#   Dom
Let this remain

Re#
 Hear the sirens
                       Dom    Do4 Dom Do4
Covering distance in the night
    Re#
The sound echoing closer
                        Dom    Do4 Dom Do4
Will they come for me next time?
    La#                                   Re#    Solm
For every choice, mistake I've made, it's not my plan
La#                          Re#    Dom
 To send you in the arms of another man
    La#                                   Re#   Solm
And if you choose to stay I'll wait, I'll understand
Dom7
 Oh, it's a fragile thing
     Re#     La#
This life we lead
               Fam7               Dom             Re#
If I think too much I can get over-whelmed by the grace
            La#                 Fam7                   Re#/Sol
By which we live our lives with death over our shoulders
Sol#          Re#                La#
 Want you to know that should I go
                     Fam7                  Re#/Sol Sol#
I always loved you, held you high above, true
             Re#                      Fam   Re#  Dom
I study your face, and the fear goes away

The fear goes away,

The fear goes     away,
               La#
The fear goes away
           Fam7
Ah-ah, oh-oh
          Re#/Sol Sol#   Re#   La#   Fam7
Ah-ah, oh-oh...
