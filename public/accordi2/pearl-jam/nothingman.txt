Once divided..... nothing left to subtract
Fa                     Rem  Do4      Rem   La#add9
Some words when spoken..... can't be taken back
Fa               Rem        Do4         Rem        La#add9
Walks on his own.....  with thoughts he can't help thinking
Fa             Rem             Do4       Rem      La#add9    Rem
Future's above..... but in the past he's slow and sinking
La#add9                     Do4          La#add9           Rem/La  La#add9  Do4
Caught a bolt of lightning... cursed the day he let it go...

Nothingman.......... nothingman

Isn't it something? Nothing..man

She once believed.... in every story he had to tell
Fa                    Rem  Do4      Rem   La#add9
One day she stiffened..... took the other side
Fa           Rem           Do4         Rem           La#add9
Empty stares.... from each corner of a shared prison cell
Fa               Rem      Do4    Rem      La#add9   Rem
One just escapes... one's left inside the well.....
    La#add9        Do4        La#add9               Rem/La  La#add9  Do4
And he who forgets... will be destined to remember...   oh..oh..oh..

  Oh, she don't want him (she don't want him)
La#add9                  Rem            La#add9  Do4   Rem
  Oh, she won't feed him.... after he's flown   away....
    La#add9                         Rem/La  La#add9
Oh, into the sun, yeah into the sun........
