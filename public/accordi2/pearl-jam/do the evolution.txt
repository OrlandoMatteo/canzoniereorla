 I’m ahead, I’m a man

I’m the first mammal to wear pants, yeah

I’m at peace with my lust

I can kill ‘cause in God I trust, yeah
Do7#9   Si7#9  La#7#9   Sol/Re
 It’s evolution, baby

Sol/Re
 I’m at piece, I’m the man

Buying stocks on the day of the crash

On the loose, I’m a truck

All the rolling hills, I’ll flatten’ em out, yeah
Do7#9 Si7#9 La#7#9 Sol/Re
 It’s  herd behavior,    uh huh
Do7#9    Si7#9 La#7#9  Sol/Re
 It’s evolution, baby

Rem                   Fa
 Admire me, admire my home
          Sim7b5 La#        Rem9
Admire my song,   here’s my coat
Rem                              Fa
 This land is mine, this land is free
               Mi7           Rem
I’ll do what I want but irresponsibly
Do7#9   Si7#9  La#7#9  Sol/Re
 It’s evolution, baby

Sol/Re
 I’m a thief, I’m a liar

There’s my church, I sing in the choir:

Rem  Famaj7  Mi7  Solm

Rem  Famaj7  Mi7  Solm

              Rem                       Fa/Do
‘Cause we know, appetite for a nightly feast
               Sol/Si                  Rem9
Those ignorant Indians got nothin’ on me
               Re
Nothin’, why?

        Do7#9   Si7#9  La#7#9   Sol/Re
Because, it’s evolution, baby!

Sol/Re
 I am ahead, I am advanced

I am the first mammal to make plans, yeah

I crawled the earth, but now I’m higher

Twenty-ten, watch it go to fire
Do7#9   Si7#9  La#7#9  Sol/Re
 It’s evolution, baby
Do7#9   Si7#9  La#7#9  Sol/Re
 It’s evolution, baby
Do7#9     Si7#9 La#7#9  Sol/Re
    Do the evolution

Come on, come on, come on...
