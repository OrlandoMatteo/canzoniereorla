It was Christmas Eve babe In the drunk tank
           Re                      Sol6/La    La
An old man said to me, won't see another one
    Sol/Si  La     Re
And then he sang a song
             Sol                          Re
The Rare Old Mountain Dew And I turned my face away
    Sol       La   Re   La7sus4
And dreamed about  you

    Sol/Si La    Re              Sol
Got on a   lucky one Came in eighteen to one

They've got cars
       La
Big as bars
            Sim       Sol
They've got rivers of gold
        Re
But the wind goes right through you
                      La
It's no place for the old
         Re            Sim
When you first took my hand
     Re             Sol
On a cold Christmas Eve
    Re
You promised me
             La          Re
Broadway was waiting for me

You were handsome

You were pretty
                  La
Queen of New York City
         Re            Sol
When the band finished playing
     La             Re
They howled out for more

Sinatra was swinging
                         La
All the drunks they were singing
   Re            Sol
We kissed on the corner
     La                 Re
Then danced through the night
    Sol           Sim   La
The boys of the NYPD choir
     Re              Sim
Were singing 'Galway Bay'
        Re         Sol
And the bells were ringing
La                Re La Sim Sol
Out for Christmas day

You're a bum

You're a punk
                      La
You're an old slut on junk
       Re           Sol       La
Living there almost dead on a drip
        Re
In that bed

You scum bag

You maggot
                La
You cheap lousy faggot
      Re             Sol
Happy Christmas your arse

I could have been someone

You took my dreams

From me when I first found you

I've built my dreams around you
