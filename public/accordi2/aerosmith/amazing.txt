           Lam
I kept the right ones out
            Sol/La
And let the wrong ones in
       Do7                                     Fa
Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins
           Fam6/Sol#
There were times in my life
           Do/Sol
When I was goin' insane
Fa#m7b5
Tryin' to walk through
    Fa
The pain
       Lam
When I lost my grip
      Sol/La
And I hit the floor
        Do7
Yeah, I thought I could leave
                         Fa
but couldn't get out the door
      Fam6/Sol#
I was so sick and tired
   Do/Sol
Of livin' a lie
      Fa#m7b5
I was wishin that I
      Fa
Would die

      Do     Mim
It's Amazing
         Fa                  Mim             Sol   Sol7
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
      Do   Mim
It's Amazing
         Fa                      Mim              Sol   Sol7
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
      Fa Mim
It's Ama-zing
        Re7                     Sol7               Do    Mim/Si
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight

     Lam                           Re7
That one last shot's a Permanent Vacation
    Fa               Fa/Sol          Do     Mim/Si
And how high can you fly with broken wings?
Lam                         Re7
Life's a journey not a destination
      Fa                                 Sol    Sol7
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings

            Lam
You have to learn to crawl
           Sol/La
Before you learn to walk
      Do7                                        Fa
But I just couldn't listen to all that righteous talk, oh yeah
      Fam6/Sol#
I was out on the street,
     Do/Sol
Just tryin' to survive
Fa#m7b5
Scratchin' to stay
 Fa
Alive

      Do     Mim
It's Amazing
         Fa                  Mim             Sol   Sol7
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
      Do   Mim
It's Amazing
         Fa                      Mim              Sol   Sol7
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
      Fa Mim
It's Ama-zing
        Re7                     Sol7               Do
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight
Rem7                                Mim   Fa
Desperate hearts, desperate hearts
