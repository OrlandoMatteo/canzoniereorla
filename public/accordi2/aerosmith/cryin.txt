 There was a time
Fa#m           Do#m
 When I was so broken-hearted
Re           La        Mi
 Love wasn't much of a friend of mine
La               Mi
 The tables have turned, yeah
Fa#m                Do#m
 'Cause me and them ways have parted
Re            La           Mi
 That kind of love was the killin' kind

 All I want is someone I can't resist
Do         Sol                     Mi

Between pleasure and pain

Re               La
 It's been on my mind
      Mi
Girl, I gotta say
La                 Mi
 We're partners in crime
Fa#m         Do#m
You got that certain something
Re                La
 What you give to me
         Mi
Takes my breath away

        Sol             Re
Now the word out on the street
       Sol             Re
Is the devil's in your kiss
Do               Sol
 If our love goes  up in flames
       Mi
It's a fire I can't resist
