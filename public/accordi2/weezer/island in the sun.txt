       When you're on a holiday
           Re        Sol        Mim  Lam
You can't find the words to say
          Re          Sol       Mim  Lam
All the things that come to you
       Re      Sol      Mim  Lam
And I wanna feel it too


      Re      Sol       Mim  Lam
On an island in the sun
           Re         Sol    Mim  Lam
We'll be playing and having fun
        Re        Sol       Mim
And it makes me feel so fine
   Lam        Re       Sol
I can't control my brain

You don't need no memory
         Re      Sol          Mim  Lam
Just a place to call your own
        Re      Sol      Mim  Lam

 We'll never feel bad anymore (Hip hip)
