Mi
 Billy-Ray was a preacher's son
             La                     Mi
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along

When they gathered round and started talkin'
Si7
 That's when Billy would take me walkin'

A-through the backyard we'd go walkin'

Then he'd look into my eyes

Lord knows to my surprise
    Mi
The only one who could ever reach me
La                Mi
 Was the son of a preacher man

The only boy who could ever teach me
La                Mi
 Was the son of a preacher man
               Si
Yes he was, he was
La                  Mi7
Ooh, yes he was

Mi
 Being good isn't always easy
La         Mi
 No matter how hard I try

When he started sweet-talkin' to me
Si7
 He'd come and tell me everything is all right

He'd kiss and tell me everything is all right

Can I get away again tonight?
    Mi
The only one who could ever reach me
La                Mi
 Was the son of a preacher man

The only boy who could ever teach me
La                Mi
 Was the son of a preacher man
               Si7
Yes he was, he was
La                     Mi
(Ooh...) Lord knows he was

       Re
Yes he was
                    La
How well I remember

The look that was in his eyes
                                   Si7
Stealin' kisses from me on the sly

Takin' time to make time
                               Mi7
Tellin' me that he's all mine

Learnin' from each other's knowing

Lookin' to see how much we've grown

        La
And the only one who could ever reach me
Re                La
 Was the son of a preacher man

The only boy who could ever teach me
Re                La
 Was the son of a preacher man
               Mi7
Yes he was, he was
Re7
 Ooh, yes he was
    La
The only one who could ever reach me
           Re7                    La
He was the sweet-talking son of a preacher man

The only boy who could ever teach me
Re7                   La
I kissed the son of a preacher man

The only one who could ever move me
    Re7                   La
The sweet-lovin' son of a preacher man

The only one who could ever groove me
Re7             La    Re7  La     Re7  La
Ahh, ooh, ahh....
