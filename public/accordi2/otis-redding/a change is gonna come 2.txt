      Sol#
I was born by a river in this little old tent
  La#m                 Fam
Oh just like this river I've been running ever since
Sol#              La#m       Do#
It's been a long, long time coming
      Do7         Fam
But I know, but I know a change is gotta come
   Sol#
Oh yes it is    On my!

It's been too hard living, oh my
                      La#m
And I'm afraid to die
                             Fam
I don't know what's up there

Beyond the clouds
     Sol#          La#m        Do#
It's been a long   long time coming
      Do7             Fam
But I know, but I know a change is gotta come
   Sol#
Oh yes it is   On my!

La#m                        Sol#
  There was a time I would go to my brother
La#m                                 Fam          La#m
  I asked my brother, "Will you help me please?"
                                  Fam
He turned me down and then I ask my dear mother, oh
La#7
 I said "Mother!"
                            Re#
I said "Mother! I'm down on my knees"
            Sol#
It's been a time that I thought
                                       La#m
Lord this couldn't last for very long

But somehow I thought
                Fam
I was still able to try to carry on
     Sol#          La#m         Do#
It's been a long,  long time coming
         Do7 Fam
But I know     a change is gonna come
    Sol#         La#m
Oh, yes it is
                                      Sol#
Just like I said, I went to my little bitty brother,
                    La#m
my littele brother
                                    Fam      La#m
I asked my brother "Brother help me please?"
                                Fam
He turned me down and then I go to my little mother,
                La#7
my dear mother

I said "Mother!"
                         Re#
I said "Mother! I'm down on my knees"
                Sol#
But there was a time that I thought

Lord this couldn't last for very long
  La#m
But somehow I thought
              Fam
I was still able to try to carry on
     Sol#          La#m              Do#
It's been a long,  long time coming
          Do7 Fam
But I know,     but I know a change is gotta come
                Sol#
Oh yes it will
                    Do#
So tired of standing by myself
         Do7                Fam                  Sol#
You know that I know that a change is gotta come...
