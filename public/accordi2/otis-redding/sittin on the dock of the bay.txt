[<pre>Sol                      Si7
Sittin' in the mornin' sun
        Do                        La
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' comes
Sol                       Si7
Watching the ships roll in
           Do                    La
And then I watch 'em roll away again, yeah


    Sol                          Mi
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
             Sol          Mi
Watching the tide roll away
              Sol                         La
Ooo, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
        Sol  Mi
Wastin' time


  Sol               Si7
I left my home in Georgia
Do                      La
Headed for the 'Frisco Bay
Sol                          Si7
'Cause I've had nothing to live for
              Do                      La
And look like nothin's gonna come my way


                  Sol                      Mi
So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
             Sol          Mi
Watching the tide roll away
         Sol                          La
Ooo, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
        Sol  Mi
Wastin' time


Sol     Re     Do             Sol
Looks like, nothing's gonna change
Sol    Re             Do         Sol
Everything still remains the same
Sol       Re       Do          Sol
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
Fa                 Re
So I guess I'll remain the same, yes


Sol                       Si7
Sittin' here resting my bones
         Do                          La
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
     Sol                    Si7
It's two thousand miles I roamed
        Do                 La
Just to make this dock my home


                   Sol                     Mi
Now I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
             Sol          Mi
Watching the tide roll away
         Sol                          La
Ooo, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
        Sol  Mi
Wastin' time</pre>]
