Domaj7          Sol
You got a fast car,
Mim                 Readd11
I want a ticket to anywhere.
Domaj7           Sol
Maybe we make a deal,
Mim                    Readd11
Maybe together we can  get somewhere.
Domaj7             Sol
Any place is better.
Mim                      Readd11
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose.
Domaj7                 Sol
Maybe we'll make something,
Mim               Readd11
Me myself, I got nothing to prove.

Domaj7          Sol
You got a fast car
Mim               Readd11
And I got a plan to get us out of here
       Domaj7              Sol
I been working at the convenience store
Mim               Readd11
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Domaj7                  Sol
Won't have to drive too far
      Mim                  Readd11
Just cross the border and into the city
Domaj7      Sol
You and I can both get jobs
    Mim                  Readd11
And finally see what it means to be living

        Domaj7        Sol
You see my old man's got a problem
   Mim                   Readd11
He live with the bottle that's the way it is
            Domaj7           Sol
He says his body's too old for working
     Mim                 Readd11
His body's too young to look like his
   Domaj7             Sol
My mama went off and left him
     Mim                        Readd11
She wanted more from life than he could give
         Domaj7                  Sol
I said, "somebody's got to take care of him"
    Mim               Readd11
So I quit school and that's what I did

Domaj7          Sol
You got a fast car
           Mim                   Readd11
But is it fast enough so we can fly away
Domaj7               Sol
We gotta make a decision
Mim                           Readd11
We leave tonight or live and die this way



Domaj7 Sol   Mim Readd11   Domaj7 Sol   Mim Readd11


Mim   Readd11        Do
I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
    Sol
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
Mim
City lights lay out before us
         Re
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
    Do  Mim       Re
And I.... had a feeling that I belonged
    Do  Mim       Re                           Do           Re
And I.... had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

Domaj7          Sol
You got a fast car
    Mim                       Readd11
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
    Domaj7              Sol
You still ain't got a job
      Mim               Readd11
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
Domaj7                   Sol
I know things will get better
Mim                    Readd11
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
Domaj7                Sol
Well move out of the shelter
Mim                  Readd11
Buy a big house and live in the suburbs

You got a fast car
    Mim               Readd11
And I got a job that pays all our bills
    Domaj7             Sol
You stay out drinking late at the bar
    Mim                            Readd11
See more of your friends than you  do of your kids
Do                    Sol
I'd always hoped for better
        Mim           Readd11
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
Do                      Sol
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere
   Mim                   Readd11
So take your fast car and keep on driving
