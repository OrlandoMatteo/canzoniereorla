[<pre>Mim           Si
You were my sun
Do            Lam
You were my earth
Mim              Si                  Do            Lam
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
Mim              Si
So you took a chance
Do               Lam
And made other plans
Mim                    Si                           Do              Lam
But I bet you didn't think your thing would come crashing down, no
Mim                  Si
You don't have to say, what you did,
  Do              Lam
I already know, I found out from him
Mim                              Si                    Do
Now there's just no chance, for you and me, there'll never be
    Lam                      Mim              
And don't it make you sad about it


                Si                 
You told me you loved me
            Do               Lam
Why did you leave me, all alone
Mim                   Si
Now you tell me you need me
         Do                 Lam
When you call me, on the phone
Mim          Si                      Do
Girl I refuse, you must have me confused
                 Lam
With some other guy
Mim                   Si                      Do
Your bridges were burned, and now it's your turn
    Lam            Mim      Si
To cry, cry me a river

I know that they say
                    Do             Lam   
That somethings are better left unsaid
Mim          Si             Do                     Lam
It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
(Don't act like you don't know it)
Mim           Si
All of these things people told me
     Do               Lam
Keep messing with my head
(Messing with my head)
Mim                   Si
You should've picked honesty
     Do                    Lam
Then you may not have blown it
(Yea..)

You don't have to say, what you did,
(Don't have to say, what you did)

(I already know, uh)
Mim                              Si                    Do 
Now there's just no chance, for you and me, there'll never be
