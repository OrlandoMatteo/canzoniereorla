Aren't you somethin' to admire, cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
                     Sim              Fa#m                     Mim    La#dim
And I can't help but notice your reflect in this heart of mine
       Sim          Fa#m         Mim                      Sol
If you ever feel alone and the glare makes me hard to find
                   Sim           Fa#m               Mim     
Just know that I'm always parallel on the other side


                La#dim      Sim                        Fa#m
Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
                       Mim                    Sol
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
                          Sim                                 Fa#m
Just put your hand on the glass, I'm here tryin' to pull you through
                    Mim
You just gotta be strong

Cause I don't wanna lose you now

I'm lookin' right at the other half of me

The vacancy that sat in my heart
       La                  Sol
Is a space that now you hold
                         Re
Show me how to fight for now
         La                     Mim
And I'll tell you baby, it was easy
                 Sim                       Re
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
         La               Sol
You were right here all along

And now it's clear as this promise

That we're making two reflections into one

Aren't you somethin', an original cause it doesn't seem merely a sample

And I can't help but stare cause I see truth somewhere in your eyes
            Sim              Fa#m              Mim                    Sol
ooh I can't ever change without you, you reflect me, I love that about you
         Sim                  Fa#m            Mim      
And if I could, I would look at us all the time

Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
