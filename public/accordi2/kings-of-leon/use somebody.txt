                      Do                  Do/Mi           Fa
I've been roaming around,  Always looking down at all I see
         Do               Do/Mi           Fa
Painted faces fill the places I canâ€™t reach

[Chorus 1]
                      Lam          Do Fa
You know that I could use somebody
                      Lam          Do Fa
You know that I could use somebody


             Do                 Do/Mi               Fa
Someone like you, and all you know, And how you speak
             Do          Do/Mi           Fa
Countless lovers under cover of the street

[Chorus 1]
                      Lam          Do Fa
You know that I could use somebody
                      Lam          Do Fa
You know that I could use somebody


             Do        Do/Mi       Fa
Someone like you Ooooahh Ooooahhh  Ahhhhh
Do        Do/Mi       Fa             x 2

             Do                     Do/Mi               Fa
Off in the night, while you live it up, I'm off to sleep
       Do                  Do/Mi             Fa
Waging wars to shape the poet and the beat
Guitar In
                  Lam             Do Fa
I hope it's gonna make you notice
                  Lam             Do Fa
I hope it's gonna make you notice


             Do          Do/Mi       Fa
Someone like me Ooooahh Ooooahhh  Ahhhhh
