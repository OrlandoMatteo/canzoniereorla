       Mi

       Do#m    Mi    Do#m

                  Mi
Lay where you're laying

Don't make a sound
                Do#m
I know they're watching

They're watching
           Mi
All the commotion

The kiddie-like play
               Do#m
It has people talking

Talking

Mi
You
               Do#m  La
Your sex is on fire

                Mi
The dark of the alley

The breaking of day
                Do#m
Head while I'm driving

I'm driving
               Mi
Soft lips are open

Them knuckles are pale
                   Do#m
Feels like you're dying
       Lamaj7
You're dying

Mi
You
                 Do#m   La
Your sex is on fire
   Mi
Consumed
                      Do#m   La
With what's just transpired

         Mi
Hot as a fever

Rattle of bones
             Do#m
I could just taste it

Taste it
              Mi
If this not forever

If this just tonight
                      Do#m
Oh we're still the greatest
     Lamaj7
The greatest  ...The greatest

Mi
You
                Do#m   La
Your sex is on fire
Mi
You
                Do#m
Your sex is on fire
   Mi
Consumed
                      Do#m   La
With what's just transpired
    Mi
And you
                Do#m   La
Your sex is on fire
    Mi
Consumed
                      Do#m   La   Mi
With what's just transpired
