[<pre>Mi   Do#m

                  Mi
Lay where you're laying
                  Mi
Don't make a sound
                Do#m
I know they're watching
                Do#m
They're watching


            Mi
All the commotion
            Mi
the kiddie like play
           Do#m
Has people talking
           Do#m
Talking


Mi
You
                 Do#m    La
Your sex is on fire


                Mi
The dark of the alley
                Mi
The break of the day
                  Do#m
Head while I'm driving
                  Do#m
I'm driving

              Mi
Soft lips are open
              Mi
Them knuckles are pale
                  Do#m
Feels like you're dying
        La
You're dying


Mi
You
                 Do#m    La
Your sex is on fire
    Mi
Consumed
                     Do#m    La
With what's to transpire


          Mi
Hot as a fever
          Mi
Rattling bones
              Do#m
I could just taste it
              Do#m
Taste it


                Mi
But it's not forever
                Mi
But it's just tonight
                     Do#m
Oh we're still the greatest
                     Do#m
The greatest
                     Do#m
The greatest


Mi
You
                 Do#m    La
Your sex is on fire

Mi
You
                Do#m
Your sex is on fire

    Mi
Consumed
                     Do#m    La
With what's to transpire

    Mi
And You
                Do#m    La
Your sex is on fire

    Mi
Consumed
                     Do#m   La    Mi
With what's to transpire</pre>]
