Re#                     Sol#
We've all been hurt by love
                Fam          Re#
It's out of our hands

But for all it's worth
              Sol#          Fam
I'm drawing a line in the sand

La#                         Sol#    La#
Another morning just won't do
                             Sol#
I need your love to shine on through

Or it won't be new


Solm
Whatever it takes, my love, I'll find it
   Dom
Whatever it takes my love
Solm
To put the lonely days behind us
    Dom
I'm laying it down
Fam                           La#
Whatever it takes my love

If there's a chance
        Sol#            Fam      Re#
For two hearts to celebrate
                           Sol#
To blow out some candles
                Fam             La#
And tempt the hands of fate

                               Sol#    La#
You make a wish, I'll make one too
                                  Sol#
But close your eyes love when you do

Or it won't be true


Solm
Whatever it takes, my love, I'll find it
   Dom
Whatever it takes my love
Solm
To put the lonely days behind us
    Dom
I'm laying it down
Fam                           La#  Do
Whatever it takes my love


(Do)            Rem
'Cos I've been wandering 'round
         Mim        Fa      Do
With the same old blues
                Rem
That have been dragging me down
       Mim                Fa
If you feel the same way too
                    Solm
Maybe it just takes two

(Re# Sol# Fam)
And if we give thanks
For our love at each new dawn
We'll find the strength
And the will to carry on

(La# Sol#)
The sun alone will never do
Without your love to shine on through
It just won't be new

Whatever it takes, my love, I'll find it
Whatever it takes, my love
To put the lonely days behind us
I'm laying it down
Whatever it takes, my love</pre>]
