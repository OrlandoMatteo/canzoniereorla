[<pre>Do                      Mim
If you ever leave me baby
Do                         Mim
Leave some morphine at my door
Rem                                     Lam
Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
Rem                                       Sol
To realize what we used to have, we don't,

Have it anymore
 
Do                              Mim
There's no religion that could save me
Do                                      Mim
No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh oh
Rem                                     Lam
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
Rem                                      Sol
To keep you by my side to keep you from walking out the door


      Fa                 Sol
Cause there'll be no sunlight
Mim            Lam Solsus2 
If I lose you baby
Fa              Sol
There'll be no clear skies 
Mim            Lam Solsus2
If I lose you baby
Fa              Sol        Mi7                 Lam          
Just like the clouds my eyes will do the same
   Solsus2     Rem
If you walk away
                 Sol            Sol-once
Everyday it will rain, rain, ra-AAA-in

I'll never be your Mother's favorite
Do                                    Mim
Your Daddy can't even look me in the eye, oooh
Rem                                       Lam
If I was in their shoes I'd be doin' the same thing
        Rem
Sayin' "There goes my little girl
                 Sol
Walkin' with that troublesome guy"

            Do                                   Mim
But they're just afraid of something they can't understand, oooh
Do                                          Mim
But little by little watch me change their minds
                 Rem                              Lam
And for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll tr---y
                   Rem
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleedin'
   Sol
If that'll make it right

Oh, don't you say (don't you say) goodbye (goodbye)
