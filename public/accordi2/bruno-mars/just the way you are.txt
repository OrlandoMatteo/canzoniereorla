Oh her eyes, her eyes, make the stars look like they're not shining
Sim7
 Her hair, her hair, falls perfectly without her trying

 She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day

     Re
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe me
Sim7
 And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
Sol                                             Re
 But every time she asks me do I look okay, I say

When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change

Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
             Re                      Sim7
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while

Cause girl you're amazing, just the way you are, (yeah)

 Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Sim7
 Her laugh, her laugh, she hates but I think it's so sexy

Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
   Sim7
If perfect is what you're searching for, then just stay the same
Sol                                                            Re
So, don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I'll say
