Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Sol               Sol7                  Do              Mim/Si

Lam                    Do                             Rem
When our friends talk about you all it does is just tear me down
Sol                                     Do
Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

Mmm too young, too dumb to realize


     Sol                      Fa      Sol              Do
That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
                        Fa    Sol          Do
Shoulda gave you all my hours when I had the chance
                  Fa                   Sol                Lam

Re7            Fa                  Fam                   Do     Fa Do   Mim/Si
Now my baby's dancing, but she's dancing with another man


Lam           Do                    Rem
My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways
Sol                    Sol7                     Do           Mim/Si
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
         Lam     Do                         Rem
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made ooh
Sol                                    Do
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes

Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
      Re7
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
           Rem
To try and apologize for my mistakes
           Sol
But I just want you to know

 
                   Fa      Sol                      Do
I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hand

Give you all his hours when he has the chance
                  Fa             Sol                     Lam
