There's no place I'd rather be in this world
                        Sim7   La
Your eyes are where I'm lost in
Lam7             Si
Underneath the chandelier
      Solmaj7         Solm
We're dancin' all alone
           Mim7
There's no reason to hide
           Sim7
What we're feelin' inside
      La4 La
Right now

 
                   Solmaj7
So baby let's just turn down the lights
    Laadd9
And close the door
Sim7
Oooh I love that dress
              Lam7      Re  Solmaj7
But you won't need it anymore
             Fa#m7
No you won't need it no more
           Mim7              Fa#m7   Solmaj7
Let's just kiss 'til we're naked, baby

Re           Fa#m7              Solmaj7
I unzip the back to watch it fall
                                La6
While I kiss your neck and shoulders
Re           Fa#m7               Solmaj7  
No don't be afraid to show it off
                            Sim7   La6
I'll be right here ready to hold you
Lam7                   Si

Don't be confused by my smile
               Sim7                  La4    La
'Cause I ain't never been more for real, for real
