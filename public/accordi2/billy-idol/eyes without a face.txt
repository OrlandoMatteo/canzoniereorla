Mimaj7           Do#m
I'm all out of hope
             Sol#m7               Si
One more bad dream could bring a fall?
Mimaj7              Do#m
When I'm far from home
                     Sol#m7
Don't call me on the phone
                   Si
To tell me you're alone
     Mimaj7      Do#m
It's easy to deceive
             Sol#m
It's easy to tease
                  Si
But hard to get release
La               Si
(Les yeux sans visage)
               La                    Si
eyes without a face (les yeux sans visage)
               La                    Si
Eyes without a face (les yeux sans visage)
               Fa#m7
Eyes without a face,
             Sol#m7                    Mimaj7  Do#m  Sol#m7  Si
got no human grace your eyes without a face

Mimaj7            Do#m
I spend so much time
                  Sol#m7
Believing all the lies
                    Si
To keep the dream alive
Mimaj7            Do#m
Now it makes me sad
                   Sol#m
It makes me mad at truth
                    Si
For loving what was you
La               Si
(Les yeux sans visage)
               La                    Si
eyes without a face (les yeux sans visage)
               La                    Si
Eyes without a face (les yeux sans visage)
               Fa#m7
Eyes without a face,
             Sol#m7                    Mimaj7
got no human grace your eyes without a face

Mimaj7           Do#m
Now I close my eyes
             Sol#m7
And I wonder why
           Si
I don't despise
Mimaj7          Do#m
Now all I can do
              Sol#m7
Love what was once
             Si
So alive and new
                        Sol#m
But it's gone from your eyes
              Si
I'd better realize
La               Si
(Les yeux sans visage)
               La                    Si
eyes without a face (les yeux sans visage)
               La                    Si
Eyes without a face (les yeux sans visage)
               Fa#m7
Eyes without a face,
             Sol#m7                    Fa#m7
got no human grace your eyes without a face
             Sol#m7                    Mimaj7
Such a human waste your eyes without a face...

                     Mimaj7
And now it's getting worse
