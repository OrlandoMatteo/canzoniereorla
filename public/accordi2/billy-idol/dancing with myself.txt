       Mi
On the floors of Tokyo
          La
A-down in London town's a go go
           Si
A-with the record selection,

And the mirror's reflection,
      La
I'm a dancin' with myself
       Mi
A-when there's no one else in sight,
     La
A-in crowded lonely night
        Si
Well, I wait so long for my love vibration
        La
And I'm dancing with myself

       Mi
Oh oh  Dancing with a-myself,
        La
Oh, oh, dancing with myself
              Si
Well, there's nothing to lose

And there's nothing to prove, well,
La                                     Mi
Dancing a-with myself, oh, oh, oh, oh

     Mi
If I looked all over the world
            La
And there's ev'ry type of girl
         Si
But your empty eyes seem to pass me by
             La
And leave me dancin' with myself
         Mi
So let's sink another drink
             La
'Cause it'll give me time to think
     Si
If I had the chance I'd ask one to dance
            La
And I'll be dancin' with myself

       Mi
Oh oh  Dancing with a-myself,
        La
Oh, oh, dancing with myself
              Si
Well, there's nothing to lose

And there's nothing to prove, well,
La
Dancing a-with myself
           Mi
Oh, oh, oh
            La         Mi          Si
Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh...

Si  Mi  Si  Mi

Si  Mi  Si  Mi  Si

     Mi
If I looked all over the world
            La
And there's ev'ry type of girl
         Si
But your empty eyes seem to pass me by
             La
And leave me dancin' with myself
         Mi
So let's sink another drink
             La
'Cause it'll give me time to think
     Si
If I had the chance I'd ask one to dance
            La
And I'll be dancin' with myself

dancing with myself

       Mi
Oh oh  Dancing with a-myself,
        La
Oh, oh, dancing with myself
     Si
If I had the chance I'd ask one to dance

If I had the chance I'd ask one to dance

If I had the chance I'd ask one to dance

Mi             La
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh
           Mi
Oh, oh, oh oh
            La
Oh, oh, oh, oh,

       Mi
Oh oh  Dancing with a-myself,
        La
Oh, oh, dancing with myself
       Mi
Oh oh  Dancing with a-myself,
        La
Oh, oh, dancing with myself...
