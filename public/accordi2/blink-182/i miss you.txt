Hello there, the angel from my nightmare
    Lam                              Do/Si
The shadow in the background of the morgue
                 Do         Do/Si
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
       Lam                             Do/Si
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
                     Do
Where you can always find me
           Do/Si
We'll have Halloween on Christmas
    Lam                                 Sol/Si
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
                       Do
We'll wish this never ends

Where are you and I'm so sorry
  Lam                            Do/Si
I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight
                    Do
I need somebody and always
     Do/Si
This sick strange darkness
      Lam                            Sol/Si
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
                  Do
And as I stared I counted
Do/Si
Webs from all the spiders
Lam                                 Do/Si
Catching things and eating their insides
                   Do
Like indecision to call you
    Do/Si
and hear your voice of treason
     Lam                                 Sol/Si
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight

Stop this pain tonight
