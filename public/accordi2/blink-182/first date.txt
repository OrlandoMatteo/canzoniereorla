 In the car I just can't wait,
Sol              Fa
 to pick you up on our very first date

 Is it cool if I hold your hand?

 Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?
Do
 Do you like my stupid hair?
Sol                  Fa
 Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
Do
 I'm too scared of what you think
Sol                   Fa
 You make me nervous so I really can't eat

 When you smile, I melt inside
Sol                 Fa
 I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
Do
 I really wish it was only me and you
Sol               Fa
 I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Do
 Please don't look at me with those eyes
Sol                  Fa
 Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
Do
 I dread the thought of our very first kiss
Sol                  Fa
 A target that i'm probably gonna miss
