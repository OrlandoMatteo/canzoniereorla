Sol
I threw a wish in the well,
Mim
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
Do
I looked to you as it fell,
Re
and now you're in my way
Sol
I trade my soul for a wish,
Mim
pennies and dimes for a kiss
Do
I wasn't looking for this,
Re
but now you're in my way
Sol                                 Mim
Your stare was holdin', ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Do
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Re
Where you think you're going, baby?


Sol
Hey, I just met you,
Re
and this is crazy,
Do
but here's my number,
Re
so call me, maybe?
Sol
It's hard to look right,
Re
at you baaaabeh,
Do
but here's my number,
Re
so call me, maybe?

Sol
Hey, I just met you,
Re

Do

Re

Sol
And all the other boys,
Re
try to chase me,
Do
but here's my number,
Re
so call me, maybe?


Sol
You took your time with the call,
Mim
I took no time with the fall
Do
You gave me nothing at all,
Re
but still, you're in my way
Sol
I beg, and borrow and steal
Mim
Have foresight and it's real
Do
I didn't know I would feel it,
Re
but it's in my way
Sol                                 Mim

Sol
Before you came into my life
Re
I missed you so bad
Do
I missed you so bad
Re
I missed you so, so bad

Sol
Before you came into my life
Re
I missed you so bad
Do
And you should know that
Re
I missed you so, so bad
