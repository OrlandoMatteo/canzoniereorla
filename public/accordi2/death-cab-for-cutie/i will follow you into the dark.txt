Do/Sol
Love of mine
        Lam/Mi
someday you will die,
            Fa 
but I'll be close behind;
             Do            Sol
I'll follow you into the dark.
   Do/Sol
No blinding light
              Lam/Mi
or tunnels to gates of white,
               Fa
just our hands clasped so tight
         Do                  Sol
waiting for the hint of a spark. 


     Lam               Do              Fa             Do    Sol/Si      
If heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied,
  Lam           Do              Sol
illuminate the "no"s on their vacancy signs.
     Lam              Do                 Mi      Lam     Lam/Sol    
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks

then I'll follow you into the dark.

 
   Do/Sol
In Catholic school,
              Lam/Mi
as vicious as Roman rule,
          Fa 
I got my knuckles bruised 
     Do        Sol
by a lady in black.
      Do/Sol
And I held my tongue 
       Lam/Mi
as she told me "Son, 
            Fa
fear is the heart of love".
     Do          Sol
So I never went back.

Do/Sol
You and me
                Lam/Mi
have seen everything to see
                Fa
from Bangkok to Calgary, 
        Do             Sol
and the soles of your shoes
     Do/Sol
are all worn down.
             Lam/Mi
The time for sleep is now
                    Fa
but it's nothing to cry about  
             Do               Sol      
'cause we'll hold each other soon
       Lam          Fa
in the blackest of rooms.
