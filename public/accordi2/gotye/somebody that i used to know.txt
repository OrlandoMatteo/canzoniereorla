Now and then I think of when we were together
Lam            Sol                Lam      Sol         Lam  Sol Lam Sol
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Lam      Sol                 Lam        Sol   
Told myself that you were right for me
Lam          Sol              Lam     Sol
But felt so lonely in your company
Lam           Sol                Lam       Sol        Lam   Sol Lam Sol
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Lam         Sol            Lam
Like resignation to the end
Sol          Lam  Sol Lam Sol
Always the end
Lam         Sol                   Lam       Sol
So when we found that we could not make sense
Lam       Sol                  Lam         Sol
Well you said that we would still be friends
Lam         Sol              Lam        Sol       Lam   Sol Lam  Sol
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over


Lam      Sol              Fa      Sol
But you didn't have to cut me off
Lam       Sol             Fa
Make out like it never happened
         Sol          Lam
And that we were nothing
    Sol            Fa         Sol
And I don't even need your love
        Lam              Sol
But you treat me like a stranger
         Fa        Sol
And that feels so rough
Lam   Sol               Fa      Sol
You didn't have to stoop so low
Lam          Sol                  Fa
Have your friends collect your records
         Sol            Lam
And then change your number
   Sol                 Fa         Sol
I guess that I don't need that though
Lam                   Sol          Fa       Sol
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Lam Sol Fa Sol
Lam                   Sol          Fa       Sol
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Lam Sol Fa Sol
Lam                   Sol          Fa       Sol
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
Lam            Sol             Fa                Sol         Lam  Sol Lam Sol
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
Sol
And I don't wanna live that way
Sol
Reading into every word you say
Sol
You said that you could let it go
Sol
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...
