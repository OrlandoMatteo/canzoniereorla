It cost me a lot
                Dom9              Sol#maj7
But there's one thing that I've got
        Fam6  Sol7+
It's my man
        Lam7b5  Sol#maj7
It's my man
        Sol7b9
Cold or wet
           Sol#7sus4
Tired, you bet
                 Sol7+
All of this I'll soon forget

       Dom6  Sol#add9/Do
With my man
       Dom9       Sol#add9/Do
He's not much on looks
        Lam7b5     Sol#7
He's no hero out of books
      Sol#7sus4  Sol7
But I love him
       Lam7b5   Sol#7sus4
Yes, I love him
       Sol7b9
Two or three girls
   Sol#7sus4
Has he
        Sol7sus4           Sol#7sus4
That he likes as well as me
      Lam7b5
But I love him
                   Dom9/Sol
I don't know why I should
         La#7add6
He isn't true
             Sol#7
He beats me, too
           Sol7   La#7add6
What can I do?

                       Re#maj7 Fam7
Oh, my man, I love him so
            Re#/Sol
He'll never know
    Solm11  Do7sus4     Fam7  La#7b9
All my life is just despair
        Fam7       La#9
But I don't care
                         Fam7  La#7+
When he takes me in his arms
             Fam7    La#7add6
The world is bright
  Re#6    Do9  Fam7
All right
                           Re#maj7 Fam7
What's the difference if I say
         Do#9
I'll go away
       Do#/Re#        Sol#maj7
When I know I'll come back
            Si9
On my knees someday
                    Re#add9/Sol
For whatever my man is
    Do7   Fa9 La#7b9 Re#   Fam7 La#7b9 Si9 Re#6
I'm his forever-------more
