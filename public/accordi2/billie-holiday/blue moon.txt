Blue Moon
           Mi7       Lamaj7  Fa#m7  Sim7
You saw me standing alone
          Mi7         Sol6  Fa#7  Si9
Without a dream in my heart
          Mi7      Lamaj7  Fa#m7 Sim7  Mi9
Without a love of my own
     Lamaj7  Fa#m7  Sim7
Blue Moon
           Mi7             Lamaj7  Fa#m7  Sim7
You know just what I was there for
             Mi7       Sol6  Fa#7  Sim7
You heard me saying a prayer for
          Mi7          Lamaj7  Sim7/Mi  Lamaj7
Someone I really could care for

               Sim7       Mi       Lamaj7
And then there suddenly appeared before me
    Sim7            Mi      Lamaj7
The only one my arms will hold
        Rem7             Sol9    Domaj7
I heard somebody whisper please adore me
           Fa#7sus4                Si9    Mi
And when I looked to the Moon it turned to gold
