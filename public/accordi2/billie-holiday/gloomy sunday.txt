Solm
 Sunday is gloomy
   Mim7b5       Dom6
My hours are slumberless
Solm        Dom7
Dearest the shadows
  Do#dim           Re7     Dom7
I live with are numberless
                     Re#7
Little white flowers will
          Re7     Re#maj7
Never awaken you
              Mim7b5
Not where the black coach
Lam7b5       Re7
Of sorrow has taken you
Solm    La#             Mim7b5
 Angels have no thought of
       Dom7
Ever returning you
Solm         Dom7
 Would they be angry
   Do#dim       Re7          Re7b9
If I thought of joining you
     Solm6
Gloomy Sunday

          Solm/Fa  Mim7b5
Gloomy is sunday
               Do9          Dom7
With shadows I spend it all

My heart and I have
Do#dim      Re7       Dom7
Decided to end it all

Soon there'll be candles
Lam7b5              Re7
And prayers that are sad
      La#            Solm6
I know, let them not weep
        Dom7
Let them know
         Re7         Solm
That I'm glad to go
            Solm/Fa#
Death is no dream
   La#/Fa          Mim7b5     Dom7
For in death I'm caressing you

With the last breath of my
Re#7         Re7
Soul I'll be blessing you

Gloomy  Sunday
