[<pre>Sol              Sim
I'm so tired of being here
Sol              Sim
Suppressed by all my childish fears
Sol
And if you have to leave
Sim
I wish that you would just leave
Sol
'Cause your presence still lingers here
Sim                          Mim
And it won't leave me alone


Mim         Sim               Mim
These wounds won't seem to heal
Sim                      Mim
This pain is just too real
Sim                          Re             Mim
There's just too much that time cannot erase


Mim          Do        Re         Sim
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
Mim          Do        Re         Sim
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
Mim          Do        Re         Sim
I held your hand through all of these years
Mim          Do     Re
But you still have
Re        Sol  Sim  Sol  Sim
All of me


Sol               Sim
You used to captivate me
Sol              Sim
By your resonating light
Sol              Sim
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Sol
Your face it haunts
Sim
My once pleasant dreams
Sol
Your voice it chased away
Sim                  Mim
All of the sanity in me


Sim                         Mim
These wounds won't seem to heal
Sim                    Mim
This pain is just too real
Sim                          Re            Mim
There's just too much that time cannot erase


Mim          Do        Re         Sim
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
Mim          Do        Re         Sim
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
Mim          Do        Re         Sim
I held your hand through all of these years
Mim          Do     Re
But you still have
Re         Do
All of me

Do                Mim         Re               Do     Do/Si
I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
Lam                        Sim
But though you're still with me
Do          Re          Mim   Do  Re  Sim
I've been alone all along

Mim   Do  Re  Sim


Mim          Do        Re         Sim
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
Mim          Do        Re         Sim
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
Mim          Do        Re         Sim
I held your hand through all of these years
Mim          Do     Re
But you still have
Re        Sol
All of me
