       Mim    Do/Mi

 Mim                     Do/Mi
 How can you see into my eyes

 like open doors
 Mim                      Do/Mi
 Leading you down into my core

 where I've become so numb
Mim
  Without a soul
Do/Mi                  Mim
 my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
                        Do/Mi
 until you find it there and lead it back home

 Mim
 Wake me up
              Sol4 Sol
 Wake me up inside

 I can't wake up

 Wake me up inside
 Re
 Save me
           Mim
 Call my name and save me from the dark

 Wake me up
                 Sol4 Sol
 Bid my blood to run

 I can't wake up

 Before I come undone
 Re
 Save me
           Mim
 Save me from the nothing I've become

 Mim                         Do/Mi
 Now that I know what I'm without

 you can't just leave me
   Mim                       Do/Mi
 Breathe into me and make me real

 Bring me to life

  Mim
 Wake me up
              Sol4 Sol
 Wake me up inside

 I can't wake up

 Wake me up inside
 Re
 Save me
           Mim
 Call my name and save me from the dark

 Wake me up
                 Sol4 Sol
 Bid my blood to run

 I can't wake up

 Before I come undone
 Re
 Save me
           Mim          Do
 Save me from the nothing I've become
       Re    Mim
 Bring me to life
                        Do/Mi
 I've been living a lie
                        Do
 There's nothing inside
       Re    Mim
 Bring me to life

 Lam      Sol6              Fa#m7b5
 Frozen inside without your touch,
              Mim
 without your love, darling
Lam    Sol6       Si7
 Only you are the life among the dead

 Mim
 All of this sight

 I can't believe I couldn't see

 Kept in the dark

 but you were there in front of me
Do/Mi
 I've been sleeping a 1000 years it seems

 I've got to open my eyes to everything
Mim
 Without a thought

 Without a voice

 Without a soul

 Don't let me die here
Do/Mi
 There must be something wrong
             Mim
 Bring me to life

  Mim
 Wake me up
              Sol4 Sol
 Wake me up inside

 I can't wake up

 Wake me up inside
 Re
 Save me
           Mim
 Call my name and save me from the dark

 Wake me up
                 Sol4 Sol
 Bid my blood to run

 I can't wake up

 Before I come undone
 Re
 Save me
           Mim          Do
 Save me from the nothing I've become
       Re    Mim
 Bring me to life

 I've been living a lie
                        Do
 There's nothing inside
       Re    Mim
 Bring me to life
