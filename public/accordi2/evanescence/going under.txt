Now I will tell you what I've done for you

Sim
 Fifty thousand tears I've cried

Screaming deceiving and bleeding for you

And you still won't hear me
 Sol
(I'm going under)
Sim
Don't want your hand this time I'll save myself

Maybe I'll wake up for once

Not tormented daily defeated by you

Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom
Sol La  Mim
I'm    dying again

          Sim     Sol   Re
I'm going under, (going under)
La           Sim    Sol       Re
Drowning in you, (drowning in you)
    La        Sim      Sol       Re
I'm falling forever, (falling forever)
     La     Sim          Sol Re La    Sim
I've got to break through, I'm  going under

Sim
Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies

So I don't know what's real and what's not

Always confusing the thoughts in my head

So I can't trust myself anymore
Sol La  Mim
I'm     dying again

          Sim     Sol   Re
I'm going under, (going under)
La           Sim    Sol       Re
Drowning in you, (drowning in you)
    La        Sim      Sol       Re
I'm falling forever, (falling forever)
     La     Sim          Sol Re
I've got to break through, I'm
   La        Sol
So go on and scream
          Fa#            Sim
Scream at me I'm so far away
                   Sol
I won't be broken again
            Fa#                        Sim   Sol  Re  La
I've got to breathe I can't keep going under

Sim  Sol  Re  La

Sol La Mim    Sol
I'm    dying again

          Sim     Sol   Re
I'm going under, (going under)
La           Sim    Sol       Re
Drowning in you, (drowning in you)
    La        Sim      Sol       Re
I'm falling forever, (falling forever)
     La     Sim          Sol Re La    Sim   Sol  Re
I've got to break through, I'm  going under
La    Sim   Sol  Re
Going under
    La    Sim
I'm going under
