La#m Sol# Re#m
Li---thium, don't want to lock me up inside
La#m Sol# Re#m
Li---thium, don't want to forget how it feels without...
La#m Sol# Re#m                              La#m
Li---thium, I want to stay in love with my sorrow
Sol# Re#m                        La#m
Oh,   but God, I want to let it go

La#m                       Fa#
Come to bed, don't make me sleep alone
                  Re#m           Sol#    La#m
Couldn't hide the emptiness, you let it show
                   Fa#
Never wanted it to be so cold
                   Re#m             Sol#
Just didn't drink enough to say you love me
La#m    Fa#
I can't hold on to me,
La#m          Fa#
Wonder what's wrong with me

La#m Sol# Re#m
Li---thium, don't want to lock me up inside
La#m Sol# Re#m
Li---thium, don't want to forget how it feels without...
La#m Sol# Re#m                              La#m    Sol#  Re#m
Li---thium, I want to stay in love with my sorrow

              Fa#          Sol#       La#m
Don't want to let it lay me down this time
Fa#     Re#m Sol# La#m
Drown my will to  fly
Fa#        Fa         La#m
Here in the darkness I know myself
Fa#        Re#m         Sol#    La#m
Can't break free until I let it go

Let me go

La#m                      Fa#
Darling, I forgive you... After all,
            Re#m           Sol# La#m
Anything is better than to be alone
                         Fa#
And in the end I guess I had to fall
               Re#m            Sol#
Always find my place among the ashes
La#m    Fa#
I can't hold on to me,
La#m          Re#m
Wonder what's wrong with me

La#m Sol# Re#m
Li---thium, don't want to lock me up inside
La#m Sol# Re#m
Li---thium, don't want to forget how it feels without...
La#m Sol# Re#m                     La#m
Li---thium,  ...stay in love with you
Sol# Re#m             La#m
I'm     gonna let it go
