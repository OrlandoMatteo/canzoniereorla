        Lam  Mim

      Lam
I was perched outside in the pouring rain
Mim
Trying to make myself a sail
          Sol
Then I'll float to you, my darling
         Re7
With the evening on my tail
                  Lam
Although not the most honest means of travel
    Mim
It gets me there nonetheless
       Sol
I'm a heartless man at worst, babe
      Re7
And a helpless one at best
              Lam
Darling, I'll bathe your skin
          Mim
I'll even wash your clothes
             Sol                Re7
Just give me some candy before I go
                  Lam
Oh, darling, I'll kiss your eyes
                 Mim
And lay you down on your rug
              Sol               Re7
Just give me some candy after my hug

            Lam
Oh, and I'm often false explaining
           Mim
But to her it plays out all the same
      Sol
And although I'm left defeated
        Re7
It gets held against my name
               Lam
I know you got plenty to offer, baby
            Mim
But I guess I've taken quite enough
               Sol
Well I'm some stain there on your bedsheet
           Re7
You're my diamond in the rough
              Lam
Darling, I'll bathe your skin
          Mim
I'll even wash your clothes
              Sol               Re7
Just give me some candy before I go
                  Lam
Oh, darling, I'll kiss your eyes
                 Mim
And lay you down on your rug
              Sol              Re7
Just give me some candy after my hug

Lam    Mim

  Sol                                Re7
I know that there're writings on the wall

                   Lam
But, darling, I'll bathe your skin
          Mim
I'll even wash your clothes
              Sol              Re7
Just give me some candy after my hug

       Do                     Sol
Oh and I'll be there waiting for you
    Do                    Sol
And I'll be there waiting for you
   Do                    Mim
Oh I'll be there waiting for you
   Do                    Sol
Oh I'll be there waiting for you
   Do                    Mim
Oh I'll be there waiting for you

Do
 All the cheap and the sugary philosophies
Sol
 Have got me on the fence just waiting and waiting
Do
 All the angels and their halos
Mim
 All of them have got me waiting and waiting
