[<pre>Lam     Mim


      Lam
I was perched outside in the pouring rain
Mim
Trying to make myself a sail
          Sol
Then I'll float to you my darlin'
         Re7
With the evening on my tail
                 Lam
Although not the most honest means of travel
   Mim
It gets me there nonetheless
      Sol
I'm a heartless man at worst, babe
      Re7
And a helpless one at best


             Lam
Darling I'll bathe your skin
          Mim
I'll even wash your clothes
             Sol                   Re7
Just give me some candy, before I go
                 Lam
Oh, darling I'll kiss your eyes
                 Mim
And lay you down on your rug
             Sol
Just give me some candy
        Re7
After my heart


      Lam
Oh I'm often found explaining
Mim
But to her it plays out all the same
          Sol
and although I'm left defeated
         Re7
It get's held against my name
                 Lam
I know you got plenty to offer baby
   Mim
But I guess I've taken quite enough
      Sol
Well I'm some stain there on your bedsheet
      Re7
You're my diamond in the rough


             Lam
Darling I'll bathe your skin
          Mim
I'll even wash your clothes
             Sol                   Re7
Just give me some candy, before I go
                 Lam
Oh, darling I'll kiss your eyes
                 Mim
And lay you down on your rug
             Sol
Just give me some candy
        Re7
After my heart



Lam Mim Sol Re7
Lam Mim



  Sol                             Re7
I know that thereÂ´re writings on the wall
                Lam
But Darling I'll bathe your skin
          Mim
I'll even wash your clothes
  Sol
Just give me some candy
        Re7
After my heart



Do                      Sol
I'll be there waiting for you
Do                      Mim
Oh I'll be there waiting for you
Do                      Sol
I'll be there waiting for you
Do                   Mim
I'll be there waiting for you
Do                    Sol
I'll be there waiting for you
Do                    Mim
I'll be there waiting for you
Do                    Sol
Oh I'll be there waiting for you
Do                    Mim
I'll be there waiting for you
Do
All the cutthroats and their jagged ends
Sol
All of them have got me waiting and waiting
Do
All the cheap and their sugary philosophies
Sol
Have got me on the fence just waiting and waiting
Do
All the angels and their halos
Sol
All of them have got me waiting and waiting
Do
All the cutthroats and their jagged ends
Sol
All of them have got me waiting and waiting
Do
All the cheap and their sugary philosophies
Sol
Have got me on the fence just waiting and waiting
Do
All the angels and their halos
Sol
All of them have got me waiting and waiting</pre>]
