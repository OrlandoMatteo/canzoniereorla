       Do#m Mi/Si      Lamaj7             Fa#m9
We are proud individuals living for the city,
        Do#m            Mi/Si   Lamaj7    Fa#m9
But the flames couldn't go much higher
      Do#m  Mi/Si           Lamaj7
We find Gods and religions to,
                      Fa#m9
To paint us with salvation
     Do#m
But no one,
   Mi/Si
No nobody,
    Lamaj7         Fa#m9
Can give you the power,
   Do#m     Mi/Si
To rise over love,
      Lamaj7  Mi
And over hate,
             Fa#m9
Through this iron sky,
                         Do#m
That's fast becoming our minds
     Mi/Si         Lamaj7   Mi  Fa#m9
Over fear and into freedom

           Do#m
Oh, that's life
                       Mi/Si
Left dripping down the walls
                        Lamaj7
Of a dream that cannot breathe
               Fa#m9
In this harsh reality
        Do#m                     Mi/Si
Mass confusion spoon fed to the blind
                 Lamaj7            Fa#m9
Serves now to define our cold society
                 Do#m    Mi/Si
From which we'll rise over love,
   Lamaj7    Mi
Over hate,
             Fa#m9
Through this iron sky,
                         Do#m
That's fast becoming our minds
      Mi/Si         Lamaj7  Mi  Fa#m9
Over fear and into freedom

You just got to hold on!
                     La
You just got to hold on!
                  Mi  Lamaj7  Mi
Ohhh ohhhh oh oh

To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair
The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed,
The bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress
The hate of men will pass, and dictators die,
And the power they took from the people will return to the people
And so long as men die, liberty will never perish
Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men
Machine men with machine minds and machine hearts!
You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men!
You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful,
To make this life a wonderful adventure
Let us use that power!
Let us all unite!
          Do#m   Mi/Si
And we'll rise over love,
         Lamaj7  Mi
And over hate,
             Fa#m9
Through this iron sky,
                      Do#m
That's fast becoming our minds
     Mi/Si
Over fear,
     Lamaj7   Mi
Into freedom
     Fa#m9
Into freedom!
                  Do#m   Mi/Si
From which we'll rise over love,
         Lamaj7  Mi
And over hate...
