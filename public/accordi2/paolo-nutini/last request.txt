Slow down, lie down 
  Lam                       Mim
Remember it's just you and me 
Re               Fa#m
Don't sell out, bow out 
  Lam                      Mim
Remember how this used to be 


                Sol      Sim          Mim
I just want you closer,  is that alright? 
               Sol     Sim    Mim
Baby let's get closer, tonight 


Re               Fa#m                   Sim                         
Grant my last request and just let me hold you, don't shrug your 
Mim
shoulders 
Sol        La
Lay down beside me 
Re            Fa#m                   Sim
Sure I can accept that we're going nowhere 
                        Mim
But one last time let's go there 
Sol          La
Lay down beside me, ohhh 



Re           Fa#m                Lam                        Mim
I've found that I'm bound to wander down that long way road, ohhh 
Re             Fa#m
And I realise all about your lies, 
    Lam                                 Mim
But I'm no wiser than the fool that I was before.

Tell me how can, how can this be wrong?
