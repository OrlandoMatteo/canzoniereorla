[<pre>       Do        Mim     Lam        Mim
I see trees of green, red roses too
Rem         Do       Mi7         Lam
I see them bloom, for me and you,
      Fa             Rem         Sol          Do     Sol
And I think to myself, What a wonderful world.


      Do        Mim        Lam        Mim
I see skies of blue and clouds of white,
Rem                 Do        Mi7           Lam
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night,
      Fa             Rem         Sol          Do
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world


    Sol                         Do
The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky,
Sol                       Do
Are also on the faces of people going by
        Lam             Mim          Lam         Mim
I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
Lam             Mim    Rem   Do   Sol
Theyâ€™re really saying I love you.


       Do      Mim        Lam           Mim
I hear babies crying, I watch them grow
Rem              Do             Mi7        Lam
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know,
      Fa             Rem         Sol          Do   Si   La
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world


      Famaj7           Rem7       Sol          Do
Yes I think to myself, what a wonderful world.</pre>]
