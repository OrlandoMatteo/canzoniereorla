Hold me close and hold me fast,
     Fa#m7            Sol
This magic spell you cast,
     Sol            Mim7   La7
This is La Vie En Rose
Mim       Mim             La7
When you kiss me Heaven sighs,
    La7                Mim
And though I close my eyes,
  Mim7           Sol      Re    Mim7    La7
I see La Vie En Rose


Re        Re                Fa#m7
When you press me to your heart,
    Fa#m7        Mim
Iâ€™m in a world apart,
  Mim                Sol      Sol
A world where roses bloom

La7             La7            Mim         Re    Re
  And when you speak, angels sing from above
Mim        Mim            Fa#m7  
Every day words seem to      turn into love songs


Re         Re                 Fa#m7
Give your heart and soul to me,
    Fa#m7             Sol
And life will always be,
La7   Mim7     Re   Fa#m7   Mim7    La7
  La Vie En Rose

Re         Re                 Fa#m7
Give your heart and soul to me,

And life will always be,
La7   Mim     Re    Re
  La Vie En Rose</pre>]
