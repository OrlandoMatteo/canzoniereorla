When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary;             
              Re/Fa#      Sol           La   La4     La
When troubles come and my heart burdened be;     
             Sim        Sol              Re       Sol
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence,   
            Re      La              Re
Until you come and sit awhile with me.

You raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;
             Sim     Sol              Re         La    
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;
     Sim           Sol             Re       Sol
I am strong, when I am on your shoulders;
             Re     La               Re
You raise me up to more than I can be.
