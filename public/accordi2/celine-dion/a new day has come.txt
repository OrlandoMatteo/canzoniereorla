A new  day    ah...

Re#m7
 I was waiting for so long

For a miracle to come
Re#m7 Siadd9       Fa#   Do#
  Everyone told me to be strong
Siadd9      Re#m7        Do#
Hold on and don't shed a tear
Re#m7        Siadd9       Fa#  Do#
 Through the darkness and good times
Re#m7   Siadd9      Fa#  Do#
 I knew I'd make it through
Re#m7    Siadd9            Fa#    Do#
 And the world thought I'd had it all
    Siadd9 Re#m7       Do#
But I was  waiting for you

Re#m7 Si  Fa#     Do#          Re#m7
Hush  now I see a light in the sky
Si Fa#         Do#
Oh it's almost blinding me
Re#m7     Si              Fa#           Do#        Sol#
I can't believe I've been touched by an angel with love
        Siadd9         Fa#       Do#    Re#m
Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
       Siadd9       Fa#          Do#
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
       Siadd9      Fa#         Do# Re#m
Let it shatter the walls for a new sun
  Siadd9 Fa#/La# Do#
A new    day     has
Re#m  Siadd9  Fa#  Do#
come

Re#m7         Siadd9           Fa# Do#
 Where it was dark now there's light
Re#m7            Siadd9           Fa# Do#
 Where there was pain now there's joy
Re#m7            Siadd9     Fa#      Do#
 Where there was weakness I found my strength
Siadd9     Re#m7     Do#
All in the eyes of a boy
