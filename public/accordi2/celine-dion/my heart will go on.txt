Mi              Si
Every night in my dreams
  La         Mi    Si
I see you I feel you 
Mi             Si           La
that is how I know you go on.
Mi              Si
Far across the distance 
    La      Mi       Si
and spaces between us 
Mi                Si           La
you have come to show you go on.


Do#m   Si          La        Si 
Near, far, where ever you are
  Do#m              Si             La
I believe that the heart does go on.
Do#m  Si         La        Si
Once more, you open the door
           Do#m        Si
and you're here in my heart and 
   La             Si      Mi
my heart will go on and on.


                  Si
Love can touch us one time 
    La        Mi    Si  
and last for life time 
Mi         Si                 La
and never let go till we're gone.
Mi               Si              La         Mi      Si
Love was when I loved you, one true time I hold to
Mi                Si         La
In my life we'll always go on.


Do#m   Si        La        Si 
Near, far wher ever you are 
  Do#m              Si             La   
I believe that the heart does go on.
Do#m  Si         La        Si
Once more, you open the door
           Do#m        Si
and you're here in my heart 
       La             Si      Do#m Si La
and my heart will go on and on.
