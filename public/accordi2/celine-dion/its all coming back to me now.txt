       Do  Do/Si  Fa/La  Fa/Sol

           Do              Do/Mi       Fa
There were nights when the wind was so cold
        Rem7          Mim7
That my body froze in bed
          Lam7           Rem7              Fa     Sol4 Sol
If I just listened to it right outside the window
           Do            Do/Mi      Fa
There were days when the sun was so cruel
             Rem7            Mim7
That all the tears turned to dust
           Lam7              Rem7        Fa     Sol4  Sol
And I just knew my eyes were drying up forever
Mim         Lam           Fa      Sol      Do
 I finished crying in the instant that you left
      Mim            Lam              Fa    Sol4 Sol
And I can't remember where or when or how
      Mim            Lam            Fa    Sol  Faadd9     Fa/Sol
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

             Do
But when you touch me like this
        Do/Si
And you hold me like that
       Lam7     Rem
I just have to admit
          Fa         Sol
That it's all coming back to me
       Do
When I touch you like this
      Do/Si
And I hold you like that
        Lam7      Rem
It's so hard to believe but
      Fa         Sol
It's all coming back to me

     Do                               Fa             Sol
It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now
           Lam7       Fa
There were moments of gold
               Mim7       Fa
And there were flashes of light
           Lam7                 Fa
There were things I'd never do again
                Mim           Fa
But then they'd always seemed right
           Lam               Mim
There were nights of endless pleasure
       Lam           Fa     Rem
It was more than any laws allow
Fa/Sol
  Baby, baby
     Do
If I kiss you like this
           Do/Si
And if you whisper like that
       Lam7       Rem
It was lost long ago
          Fa        Sol
But it's all coming back to me
       Do
If you want me like this
           Do/Si
And if you need me like that
       Lam7       Rem
It was dead long ago
         Fa         Sol
But it's all coming back to me
        Lam7      Rem
It's so hard to resist
         Fa         Sol
And it's all coming back to me
      Lam7     Rem
I can barely recall
         Fa         Sol        Lam  Sol/Si  Faadd9  Rem
But it's all coming back to me now

Mim           Lam              Fa       Sol    Do
 But you were history with the slamming of the door
      Mim            Lam              Fa   Sol4 Sol
And I made myself so strong again somehow
      Mim          Lam       Fa      Sol       Faadd9  Fa/Sol
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

         Do
But if I touch you like this
           Do/Si
And if you kiss me like that
       Lam7     Rem
It was so long ago
         Fa         Sol
But it's all coming back to me
       Do
If you touch me like this
         Do/Si
And if I kiss you like that
       Lam7          Rem
It was gone with the wind
         Fa         Sol
But it's all coming back to me
     Do                               Fa             Sol
It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now
           Lam7       Fa
There were moments of gold
               Mim        Fa
And there were flashes of light
           Lam7                 Fa
There were things we'd never do again
                Mim           Fa
But then they'd always seemed right
           Lam               Mim
There were nights of endless pleasure
            Lam           Fa     Rem
It was more than all your laws allow
Fa/Sol
Baby, baby, baby

         Do
When you touch me like this
             Do/Si
And when you hold me like that
       Lam7          Rem
It was gone with the wind
         Fa         Sol
But it's all coming back to me
         Do
When you see me like this
           Do/Si
And when I see you like that
        Lam7        Rem
Then we see what we want to see
Fa         Sol
All coming back to me
    Lam7          Rem
The flesh and the fantasies
Fa         Sol
All coming back to me
   Lam7        Rem
I can barely recall
         Fa         Sol        Lam  Sol  Fa
But it's all coming back to me now...

          Do
If you forgive me all this
        Do/Si
If I forgive you all that
      Lam7        Rem
We forgive and forget
         Fa         Sol         Do
And it's all coming back to me...
                 Fa
(It's all coming back to me now)
           Do
And when I touch you like that
                 Fa
(It's all coming back to me now)
       Do
If you do it like this
                 Fa
(It's all coming back to me now)
             Do
And if we...
