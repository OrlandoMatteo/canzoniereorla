[<pre>Fa              La#
Tale as old as time
Fa              La#
True as it can be
Fa                 Lam
Barely even friends
               La#
Then somebody bends
           Do
Unexpectedly


Re                  Sol
Just a little change
Re                La
Small to say the least
                  Sol
Both a little scared
                   Mim
Neither one prepared
La                       Re
Beauty and the Beast


                       Sol
         Ever just the same
Fa#m                 Sol
         Ever a surprise
             Fa#m
Ever as before
                   Sim
Ever just as sure
                      Do      La
As the sun will rise


Sol Do Sol Do
Sol Si Mim Do Re


                       Sol
         Ever just the same
Fa#m                 Sol
         Ever a surprise
             Fa#m
Ever as before
                   Sim
Ever just as sure
                     Do      La
As the sun will rise


Sol                     Do
Tale as old as time
Sol                     Do
Tune as old as song
                Sol
Bittersweet and strange
Si                          Mim
Finding you can change
     Do             Re
Learning you were wrong


Mi                La
Certain as the sun (certain as the sun)
Mi                   Sim7 Mi7
Rising in the east
                        La
Tale as old as time
                   Fa#m
Song as old as rhyme
Si                       Mi
Beauty and the Beast
                   La
Tale as old as time
                   Fa#m
Song as old as rhyme
Si                       Mi
Beauty and the Beast</pre>]
