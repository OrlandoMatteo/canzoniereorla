                    Sol#
The whispers in the morning
              Fam
Of lovers sleeping tight
                    Sol#
Are rolling by like thunder now
               Re#
As I look in your eyes
                  Sol#
I hold on to your whole body
                 Fam
And feel each move you make
                     Do#
Your voice is warm and tender
            Sol#/Do      Re#
A love that I could not forsake

                 Sol#
'Cause I'm your lady
            Do#
And you are my man
         Dom La#m
Whenever you reach for me
                   Re#
I'll do all that I can

                       Sol#
Even though there may be times
                  Fam
It seems I'm far away
             Do#
Never wonder where I am
            Sol#/Do      Re#
'Cause I am always by your side

                 Sol#
'Cause I'm your lady
               Do#
And you are my man
             La#m
Whenever you reach for me
                   Re#
I'll do all that I can
                  Sol#
We're heading for something
                     Do#
Somewhere I've never been
            Dom La#m                        Re#
Sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn
       Do#      Sol#   Do#
Of the power of love
    Re#                 Sol#      Do#
The sound of your heart beating
        Re#        Fam    Do#
Made it clear suddenly
    Re#            Sol#
The feeling that I can't go on
Do#               Re#    Do# Re#
  Is light years away
 Do#   Re#      Sol#
'Cause I'm your lady
               Do#
And you are my man
         Dom La#m
Whenever you reach for me
                         Re#
I'm gonna do all that I can
                  Sol#
We're heading for something
                     Do#
Somewhere I've never been
            Dom La#m                        Re#
Sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn
       Do#      Sol#
Of the power of love...

The power of love...
