[<pre>Do Mim Do Sol  Do Mim Re Sol x2


Do                        Mim
She'll lie and steal and cheat 
    Do                 Sol
And beg you from her knees;
Do                  Mim    Re       Sol
Make you think she means it this time.
Do                     Mim
She'll tear a hole in you,
Do                   Sol
The one you can't repair,
Do                    Mim      Re       Sol
But I still love her I don't really care.


Do            Sol      Mim   Re
When we were young, oooh we did enough.
Do           Sol     Mim       Re
When it got cold, oooooooo we bundled up.
Do          Sol     Mim        Re                Sol
I can't be told, aaaaaaaah it can't be done.


Do                       Mim
It's better to feel pain
    Do                 Sol
Than nothing at all;
Do                  Mim    Re       Sol
The opposite of love's indifference.
Do                     Mim
So pay attention now,
Do                   Sol
I'm standing on your porch screamin' out,
Do                    Mim      Re       Sol
And I won't leave until you come downstairs.


             Do    Sol             Re  Mim
So keep your head up, keep your love.
 Do    Sol             Re  Mim
keep your head up, keep your love.
          Do    Sol             Re  Mim
keep your head up, keep your love.
 Do    Sol             Re  Mim
keep your head up, keep your love.


Do                        Mim
I don't blame you dear,
    Do                 Sol
Running like you did all these years,
Do                  Mim    Re       Sol
I would do the same you best believe.
Do                     Mim
And the highway signs say we're close,
Do                   Sol
But I don't read those things anymore;
Do                    Mim      Re       Sol
I never trusted my own eyes.


Do            Sol      Mim   Re
When we were young, oooh we did enough.
Do           Sol     Mim       Re
When it got cold, oooooooo we bundled up.
Do          Sol     Mim        Re                Sol
I can't be told, aaaaaaaah it can't be done.


             Do    Sol             Re  Mim
So keep your head up, keep your love.
 Do    Sol             Re  Mim
keep your head up, keep your love.
          Do    Sol             Re  Mim
keep your head up, keep your love.
 Do    Sol             Re  Mim
keep your head up, keep your love.</pre>]
