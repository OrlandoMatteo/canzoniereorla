Mi
Look inside
                      Do#m
Look inside your tiny mind

Now look a bit harder
           Fa#m
Cause were so uninspired
Fa#m7      Fa#m7  La
So sick and tired
                      Si     Mi
Of all the hatred you harbor
                               Do#m
So you say it’s not okay to be gay

Well I think you’re just evil
Fa#m                        Fa#m7       Fa#m7  La
You’re just some racist who can’t tie my laces
                          Si7
You’re point of view is medieval

Mi                            Sol#7
 Fuck you, fuck you very very much
         Do#m
Cause we hate what you do

And we hate your whole crew
   Si7                        Mi
So please don’t stay in touch
                             Sol#7
Fuck you, fuck you very very much
           Do#m
Cause your words don’t translate

And it’s getting quite late
     Si7
So please don’t stay in touch

Mi                               Do#m
 Do you get, do you get a little kick

out of being small-minded?
            Fa#m
You want to be like your father
      Fa#m7        Fa#m7   La
Its approval you’re after
                        Si      Mi
Well that’s not how you find it
                        Do#m
Do you, do you really enjoy

living a life that’s so hateful?
                Fa#m9            Fa#m
Cause there’s a hole where your soul should be
       Fa#m7     Fa#m7     La
You’re losing control of it
                  Si7
And it’s really distasteful

Mi                            Sol#7
 Fuck you, fuck you very very much
         Do#m
Cause we hate what you do

And we hate your whole crew
   Si7                        Mi
So please don’t stay in touch
                             Sol#7
Fuck you, fuck you very very much
           Do#m
Cause your words don’t translate

And it’s getting quite late
     Si7
So please don’t stay in touch
