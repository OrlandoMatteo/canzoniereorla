Solm                                 Famaj7
When you first left me I was wanting more
                          Solm
But you were fucking that girl next door,
                 Famaj7
what you do that for (what you do that for)?
Solm                                         Famaj7
When you first left me I didn't know what to say
                   Solm
I never been on my own that way,
              Famaj7
just sat by myself all day
Solm
 I was so lost back then
Famaj7
 But with a little help from my friends
Solm                                  Famaj7
 I found a light in the tunnel at the end
Solm
 Now you're calling me up on the phone
Famaj7
 So you can have a little whine and a moan
Solm                                   Famaj7
 And it's only because you're feeling alone

Solm                     Famaj7
 At first when I see you cry,
                  Solm                     Famaj7
Yeah, it makes me smile, yeah, it makes me smile
Solm                       Famaj7
 At worst I feel bad for a while,
                Solm                  Famaj7
But then I just smile, I go ahead and smile

   Solm                              Famaj7
Whenever you see me you say that you want me back
                  Solm                               Famaj7
And I tell you it don't mean jack, no, it don't mean jack
  Solm                                        Famaj7
I couldn't stop laughing, no, I just couldn't help myself
                     Solm                        Famaj7
See you messed up my mental health I was quite unwell
Solm
 I was so lost back then
Famaj7
 But with a little help from my friends
Solm                                   Famaj7
