Oh, he treats me with respect,

He says he loves me all the time,
            Fa
He calls me 15 times a day,

He likes to make sure that im fine,
              Rem
You know I've never met a man,

Whose made me feel quite so secure,
              Fa
He's not like all them other boys,

They're all so dumb and immature.
