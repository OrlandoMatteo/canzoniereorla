        Mi   Si7

Mi              Lam
You could be my unintended
Re                Sol
Choice to live my life extended
Do               Si7             Mi
You could be the one I'll always love
                 Lam
You could be the one who listens
Re            Sol
To my deepest inquisitions
Do               Si7             Mi
You could be the one I'll always love

Mi               Lam
I'll be there as soon as I can
Re           Sol
But I'm busy mending broken
Do            Si7          Mi
Pieces of the life I had before

Mi                  Lam
First there was the one who challenged
Re                Sol
All my dreams and all my balance
Do              Si7           Mi
She could never be as good as you
                Lam
You could be my unintended
Re                Sol
Choice to live my life extended
Do                Si7             Mi   Sol  Si7/Fa#
You should be the one I'll always love

Mi               Lam
I'll be there as soon as I can
Re           Sol
But I'm busy mending broken
Do            Si7          Mi
Pieces of the life I had before
         Mi/Sol# Lam     Lam/Do
I'll be there as soon as I can
Re       Re/Fa# Sol      Sol/Si
But I'm busy    mending broken
Do            Si7          Mi
Pieces of the life I had before
            Lam  Lam/Sol  Fam7b5  Famaj7  Mi4  Mi
Before you
