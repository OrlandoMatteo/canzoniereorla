Dead inside
Sim
Sim                  Re
Revere a million prayers
       La              Sim
And draw me into the holiness
                     Re
But there's nothing there
             La
Light only shines
                 Sim
From those who share
Sim                  Re
Unleash a million drones
        La             Sim
And confine me then erase me babe
                Re
Do you have no soul
                La
It's like it died
        Sol
Long ago
      Fa#               Sim
Your lips feel warm to the touch
          La                Sol
You can bring me back to life
         Fa#              Mim            Sol
On the outside you're ablaze and alive
            Fa#
But you're dead inside

Sim                       Re
You're free to touch the sky
       La                 Sim
Whilst I am crushed and pulverised
                       Re
Because you need control
             La            Sim
Now I'm the one letting go
                    Re
You like to give an inch
       La              Sim
Whilst I am giving infinity
                          Re
But now I've got nothing left
             La
You have no cares
              Sol
And I'm bereft
       Fa#              Sim
Your skin feels warm to caress
       La             Sol
I see magic in your eyes
        Fa#             Mim            Sol
On the outside your ablaze and alive
            Fa#
But you're dead inside
Sim Sol Re La (x2)
Sim
Feel me now
Sol
Hold me please
    Re               La
I need to see who I am
     Sim
Open up to me
      Sol
Stop hiding from me
      Re
It's hurting babe
      La
Only you can stop the pain
        Sim                  Sol
Don't leave me out in the cold
        Re              La
Don't leave me out to die
  Sim        Sol
I gave you everything
                 Re
I can't give you anymore
            La                Sol
Now I've become just like you
    Fa#               Sim
My lips feel warm to the touch
        La              Sol
But my words seem so alive
    Fa#             Sim
My skin is warm to caress
          La            Sol
I'll control and hypnotise
                     Fa#            Sim
You've taught me to lie without a trace
        La              Sol
and to kill with no remorse
        Fa#               Mim         Sol
On the outside I'm the greatest guy
        Fa#
Now I'm dead inside
Sim
