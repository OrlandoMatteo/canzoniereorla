              Lam
Is our secret safe tonight
           Sol4      Sol
And are we out of sight
            Fa                  Mi
Or will our world come tumbling down?
Mi7                Lam          Lam6
Will they find our hiding place
            Sol4    Sol
Is this our last embrace
            Fa
Or will the walls start caving in?

(It could be wrong, could be wrong)
                        Lam
But it should have been right

(It could be wrong, could be wrong)
                    Sol
To let our hearts ignite

(It could be wrong, could be wrong)
                 Fa
Are we digging a hole?

(It could be wrong, could be wrong)

This is out of control

(It could be wrong, could be wrong)
               Lam
It could never last

(It could be wrong, could be wrong)
              Sol
Must erase it fast

(It could be wrong, could be wrong)
                       Fa
But it could have been right

(It could be wrong, could be...)

               Do
Love is our resistance

They'll keep us apart
                                Sol4  Sol7
and they won't stop breaking us down

Our lips must always be sealed

If we live a life in fear
            Sol4          Sol
I'll wait a thousand years
        Fa              Mi
Just to see you smile again
Mi7                   Lam
Kill your prayers for love and peace
                Sol4           Sol
You'll wake the thought police
         Fa
We can't hide the truth inside

(It could be wrong, could be wrong)
                        Lam
But it should have been right

(It could be wrong, could be wrong)
                    Sol
To let our hearts ignite
