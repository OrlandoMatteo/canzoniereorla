Si
Far Away
Do#m                     Sol#m
  This ship is taking me far away
Mi
  Far away from the
Si
Memories
Do#m                    Sol#m             Mi
  Of all the people who care if I live or die
Si
Starlight
Do#m                    Sol#m
  I will be chasing the starlight
Mi
  Until the end of my
Si
life
Do#m                   Sol#m       Mi
  I don't know if it's worth it anymore

Si   Do#m     Sol#m    Mi
Hold   you in my arms,   I just wanted to
Si   Do#m     Sol#m    Mi
Hold   you in my arms

Si
My life
Do#m            Sol#m
  You electrify my life
Mi                   Si
  Let's conspire to ignite
Do#m                       Sol#m           Mi
  All the souls that would die just to be alive

  I'll never let you go   if you promise not to
La    Mi         La    Re#
Fade away, never fade away
Sol#m Re#            Mi    Si
  Our hopes and expecta----tions
Sol#m   Re#           Mi    Si
  Black holes and revela----tions
Sol#m Re#            Mi    Si
  Our hopes and expecta----tions
