I, I can't get these memories out of my mind,
                 Re#4 Re#                La#
And some kind of madness has started to evolve

(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma...)

And I, I tried so hard to let you go,
                 Re#4 Re#                La#
But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole, yeah

(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma...)
Solm   Fa      Re#
I have finally seen the light,
    Solm   Fa      Re#
And I have finally realized
         La#
What you mean

Ooh oh oh

    La#
And now I need to know is this real love,
              Re#4 Re#            La#
Or is it just madness keeping us afloat?

(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma...)

And when I look back at all the crazy fights we had,
                  Re#4 Re#              La#
Like some kind of madness was taking control, yeah

(Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma...)
    Solm       Fa      Re#
And now I have finally seen the light,
    Solm   Fa      Re#
And I have finally realized
        La#
What you need

Mmmm...

                   (Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma...)

    Solm       Fa      Re#
But now I have finally seen the end

(finally seen the end)
    Solm      Fa      Re#
And I'm not expecting you to care

(expecting you to care)
    Solm   Fa      Re#
But I have finally seen the light

(finally seen the light)
Solm   Fa     Re#
I have finally realized (realized)
            Solm  Fa  Re#
I need your love
            Solm  Fa  Re#
I need your love
Solm
Come to me
          Fa
Just in a dream
            Re#
Come on and rescue me
      Solm             Fa
Yes I know, I can't be wrong,
                   Re#
And baby, you're too headstrong
            La#
Our love is
