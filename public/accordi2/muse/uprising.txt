       Rem


Paranoia is in bloom,
     Solm            Fa
The PR transmissions will resume
           La
They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
            Solm                    Fa
And hope that we will never see the truth around
Do#dim     Rem
(so come on)

Another promise, another seed
       Solm                     Fa         Sol#dim  La
Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed

And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
           Solm                  Fa
And endless red tape to keep the truth confined
Do#dim     Rem
(so come on)

Rem           Solm  Fa
They will not force us
La               Solm Fa    Do#dim
They will stop degrading us
Rem              Solm Fa  Sol#dim
They will not control us
La           Solm Fa
We will be victorious
Do#dim     Rem
(so come on)

Rem
 Interchanging mind control
             Solm        Fa
Come, let the revolution take its toll
            La
If you could flick the switch and open your third eye
              Solm                  Fa       Do#dim
You'd see that we should never be afraid to die
          Rem
(so come on)

Rise up and take the power back
            Solm             Fa      Sol#dim
It's time the fat cats had a heart attack
            La
You know that their time's coming to an end
          Solm                 Fa      Do#dim
We have to unify and watch our flag ascend
         Rem
(so come on)

Rem           Solm  Fa
They will not force us
La               Solm Fa    Do#dim
They will stop degrading us
Rem              Solm Fa  Sol#dim
They will not control us
La           Solm Fa
We will be victorious
Do#dim     Rem
(so come on)

Rem   Solm Fa  La   Solm  Fa Do#dim

Rem   Solm Fa  Sol#dim La   Solm  Fa Do#dim Rem

Rem           Solm  Fa
They will not force us
La               Solm Fa    Do#dim
They will stop degrading us
Rem              Solm Fa  Sol#dim
They will not control us
La           Solm Fa
We will be victorious
Do#dim     Rem
