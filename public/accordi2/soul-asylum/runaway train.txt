Do
Call you up in the middle of the night
Mim/Si
Like a firefly without a light
Lam
You were there like a blowtorch burnin'
Sol
I was a key that could use a little turnin'
Do
So tired that I couldn't even sleep
Mim/Si
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Lam
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
Sol
One more promise I couldn't keep


   Fa                Sol
It seems no one can help me now
    Do                    Lam
I'm in too deep, there's no way out
Fa                Mim           Sol
This time I have really led myself astray


Do
Runaway train never going back
Mim
Wrong way on a one-way track
Lam
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Sol
Somehow I'm neither here nor there


Do
Can you help me remember how to smile
Mim/Si
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
Lam
How on earth did I get so jaded
Sol
Life's mysteries seem so faded
Do
I can go where no one else can go
Mim/Si
I know what no one else knows
Lam
Here I am just drowning in the rain
Sol
With a ticket for a runaway train


    Fa                Sol
And everything seems cut and dry
Do              Lam
Day and night, earth and sky
Fa         Mim           Sol
Somehow I just don't believe it


Do
Runaway train never going back
Mim
Wrong way on a one-way track
Lam
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Sol
Somehow I'm neither here nor there


| Do   | Do   | Mim  | Mim  | Lam  | Lam  | Sol   | Sol  |
| Fa   | Sol   | Do   | Lam  |

Do
Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Mim/Si
Like a madman laughing at the rain
Lam
Little out of touch, little insane
Sol
It's just easier than dealing with the pain


Do
Runaway train never going back
Mim
Wrong way on a one-way track
Lam
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Sol
Somehow I'm neither here nor there
Do
Runaway train never coming back
Mim
Runaway train tearing up the track
Lam
Runaway train burning in my veins
Sol
I'd runaway but it always seems the same
