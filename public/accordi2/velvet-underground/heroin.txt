Do#   Fa#      Do#   Fa#              Do#   Fa#   Do#   Fa#
    I..  don't know... just where I'm going
    Do#  Fa#     Do#         Fa#          Do#
But I'm... gonna try for the kingdom if I can
                Fa#             Do#
Cos it makes me feel like I'm a man
             Fa#           Do#
When I put a spike into my vein
              Fa#                     Do#
And I tell ya things aren't quite the same
         Fa#           Do#
When I'm rushing on my run
      Fa#                   Do#
And I feel just like Jesus' son

      Fa#                     Do#
And I guess that I just don't know
      Fa#                     Do#
And I guess that I just don't know...


     Fa#  Do#  Fa#

Do#  Fa#     Do#   Fa#       Do#    Fa#   Do#   Fa#
I...... have made... a big decision
Do#  Fa#       Do#  Fa#              Do#
I'm....  gonna try.... to nullify my life
             Fa#             Do#
Cos when the blood begins to flow
       Fa#                     Do#
And it shoots up the dropper's neck
         Fa#           Do#
When I'm closing in on death


     Fa#  Do#  Fa#

Do#         Fa#             Do#
  You can't help me not you guys
                  Fa#                       Do#
Oh, all you sweet girls with all your sweet talk
        Fa#           Do#
You can all go take a walk

      Fa#                     Do#
And I guess that I just don't know
      Fa#                     Do#
And I guess that I just don't know...


     Fa#  Do#  Fa#

Do#  Fa#     Do#   Fa#                             Do#  Fa#  Do#  Fa#
  I.... wish that.... I was born a thousand years ago
Do#  Fa#     Do#   Fa#                        Do#
  I.... wish that.... I'd sailed the darkened seas
     Fa#               Do#
On a great big clipper ship
           Fa#               Do#
Going from this land here to that
         Fa#               Do#
Oh, in a sailor's suit and cap


     Fa#  Do#  Fa#

Do#    Fa#            Do#
  Away from the big city
        Fa#            Do#
Where a man can not be free
           Fa#           Do#
Of all the evils of this town
          Fa#             Do#
And of himself and those around

          Fa#                     Do#
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know
          Fa#                     Do#
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know


     Fa#  Do#  Fa#

Do#  Fa#   Do#  Fa#                     Do#  Fa#  Do#  Fa#
Her______ oin.... it'll be the death of me
Do#  Fa#   Do#            Fa#               Do#
Her______ oin.... it's my wife, and it's my life
          Fa#            Do#
Because a mainline in my vein
           Fa#          Do#
Leads to a center in my head
             Fa#           Do#
And then I'm better off as dead


     Fa#  Do#  Fa#  Do#  Fa#  Do#  Fa#  Do#  Fa#  Do#  Fa#

             Fa#             Do#
Cos when the smack begins to flow
      Fa#                  Do#
Oh, I really don't care anymore
              Fa#              Do#
'Bout all the jim-jims in this town
                Fa#                  Do#
And all the politicians making crazy sounds
              Fa#                    Do#
And everybody puttin' everybody else down
                 Fa#                Do#
And all the dead bodies piled up in Nam


     Fa#  Do#  Fa#  Do#  Fa#  Do#  Fa#  Do#

     Fa#  Do#  Fa#  Do#  Fa#  Do#  Fa#  Do#

             Fa#             Do#
Cos when the smack begins to flow
      Fa#                  Do#
And I really don't care anymore


     Fa#  Do#  Fa#  Do#

          Fa#             Do#
When that heroin is in my blood
        Fa#            Do#
And the blood is in my head
             Fa#                     Do#
Then I thank God that I'm as good as dead
               Fa#               Do#
And thank your God that I'm not aware
          Fa#                   Do#
And thank God that I just don't care
      Fa#                     Do#
And I guess that I just don't know
      Fa#                     Do#
And I guess that I just don't know
