      Do
I was distracted and in traffic
          Lam
I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened
                     Fa
But it really got me thinkin', were you out drinkin'?
                Sol
Were you in the livin' room, chillin' watchin' television?
           Do
It's been a year now, think I've figured out how
               Lam
How to let you go and let communication die out



Lam       Sol         Do      Mim           Fa                         
I know, you know, we know you weren't down for forever and it's fine
Lam      Sol         Do      Mim          Fa                              
I know, you know, we know we weren't meant for each other and it's fine


                                       Fa
But if the world was ending you'd come over, right?
                          Sol
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
                          Do
Would you love me for the hell of it?
                         Lam
All our fears would be irrelevant
                                   Fa
If the world was ending you'd come over right?
                             Sol
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
                        Do
And there wouldn't be a reason why
                      Lam
We would even have to say goodbye
                                   Fa           
If the world was ending you'd come over, right? 
Sol
Right?
                                   Do           
If the world was ending you'd come over, right?
Lam
Right?


           Do
I tried to imagine your reaction
          Lam
It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened
                     Fa
But it really got me thinkin', that night we went drinkin'
                Sol
Stumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen
                Do
Ah, it's been a year now, think I've figured out how
                       Lam
How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out


Lam       Sol         Do      Mim           Fa                         
I know, you know, we know you weren't down for forever and it's fine
Lam      Sol         Do      Mim          Fa                              
I know, you know, we know we weren't meant for each other and it's fine

                        Do
No, there wouldn't be a reason why
                      Lam

You'd come over, right? You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?

                   Fa                            Sol
If the world was ending... you'd come over, right?
                                                       Do
You'd come over, you'd come over, you'd come over, right?  Hmm
