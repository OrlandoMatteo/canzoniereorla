Things we lost to the flames
Mim          Do    Lam7 Re
Things we'll never see again
Mim      Do      Re
All that we have amassed
Mim    Do       Lam7           Re
Sits before us, shattered into ash

Mim                  Re
 These are the things, the things we lost
Sim                        Do
 The things we lost in the fire fire fire

Mim         Re
 We sat and made a list
   Sim                    Do
Of all the things that we had
Mim                Re
 Down the backs of table tops
Sim                   Do
Ticket stubs and your diaries
Mim          Re
 I read them all one day
     Sim                 Do
When loneliness came and you were away
Mim              Re
 Oh they told me nothing new,
      Sim                    Do
But I love to read the words you use

Mim                 Re
I was the match and you were the rock
Sim                   Do
Maybe we started this fire
Mim      Re
 We sat apart and watched
Sim                      Do
All we had burned on the pyre
         Mim                 Re
(You said) we were born with nothing
       Sim                       Do
And we sure as hell have nothing now

Do you understand that we will never be the same again?
