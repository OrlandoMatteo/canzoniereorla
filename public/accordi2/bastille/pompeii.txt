Do          Sol         Mim          Re
I was left to my own de-v-i-c-e-s
 Do         Sol              Mim         Re
Many days fell away with nothing to show


         Do                   Sol
And the walls kept tumbling down
                   Mim       Re
In the city that we l-o-v-e-d
        Do                   Sol
Great clouds roll over the hills
                       Mim      Re
Bringing darkness from a-b-o-v-e


N.C.                   Do
But if you close your eyes,
         Sol
Does it almost feel like
 Mim                Re
Nothing changed at all?
                       Do
And if you close your eyes,
         Sol
Does it almost feel like
 Mim                 Re       
You've been here before?
     Do                Sol         Re
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?

Do              Sol              Mim          Re
We were caught up and lost in all of our vices
Do            Sol            Mim        Re
In your pose as the dust settles around us


         Do                   Sol
And the walls kept tumbling down
                   Mim       Re

Do                 Sol
Oh where do we begin?
     Mim            Re
The rubble or our sins?
