Rem7               Do/Mi     Fa
Lately, I’ve been, I’ve been thinking
           Lam7  La#
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
                 Rem7
When the morning comes
                 Do/Mi   Fa
When we see what we’ve become
                     Lam7        La#
In the cold light of day we’re a flame in the wind

Not the fire that we’ve begun
      Do  Rem7                      Do/Mi Fa
Every argument, every word we can’t take  back
                         Lam7
‘Cause with the all that has happened
  La#
I think that we both know the way that the story ends
Do    Rem7              Do/Mi Fa
 Then only for a minute
          Lam7      La#
I want to change my mind
                                        Do
‘Cause this just don’t feel right to me
  Rem7                      Do/Mi Fa
I want to raise your spirits
          Lam7    La#
I want to see you smile but

Know that means I’ll have to leave

Rem7  Do/Mi Fa   La#

                                    Do
Know that means I’ll have to leave
Rem7               Do/Mi     Fa
Lately, I’ve been, I’ve been thinking
                 La#
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
         Do      Rem7
When the evening falls
                   Do/Mi   Fa
And I’m left there with my thoughts
                           La#
And the image of you being with someone else

Well, that’s eating me up inside
       Do      Rem7                 Do/Mi  Fa
But we run our course, we pretended we’re okay
                           La#
Now if we jump together at least we can swim

Far away from the wreck we made
Do    Rem7              Do/Mi Fa
 Then only for a minute
          Lam7      La#
I want to change my mind
                                        Do
‘Cause this just don’t feel right to me
  Rem7                      Do/Mi Fa
I want to raise your spirits
          Lam7    La#
I want to see you smile but

Know that means I’ll have to leave

Rem7  Do/Mi Fa   La#

                                    Do
Know that means I’ll have to leave
Rem7               Do/Mi     Fa
Lately, I’ve been, I’ve been thinking
                 La#
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
   Do   La#      Fa
So I’ll go, I’ll go
       Do      Rem  Do/Mi
I will go, go, go
        La#      Fa
So I’ll go, I’ll go
       Do
I will go, go, go

Rem7          Do/Mi     Fa
Even though I might not like this
                       La#
I think that you’ll be happier, I want you to be happier
