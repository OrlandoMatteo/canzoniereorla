Are you drunk enough?
                      Do#
Not to judge what I'm doin’
        Simaj7          Re#m
Are you high enough?
                   Do#
To excuse that I'm ruined

'Cause I’m ruined
      Simaj7         Re#m7
Is it late enough?
                         Do#add9
For you to come and stay over

 I make no promises, I can't do golden rings
Do#add9
 But I'll give you everything (tonight)

Is it loud enough?
                  Do#add9
’Cause my body is calling for you, calling for you
  Simaj7        Re#m7                     Do#add9
I need someone, to do the things that I do
    Simaj7       Re#m7                Do#add9
I'm heating up, energy’s taking control
    Simaj7         Re#m7
