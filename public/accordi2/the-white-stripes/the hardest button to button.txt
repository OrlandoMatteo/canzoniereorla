La                       Do
 We started living in an old house
La                            Do
 My ma gave birth and we were checking it out
         La
It was a baby boy
             Do
So we bought him a toy
         Si
It was a ray gun
           Re
And it was 1981
              La
We named him 'Baby'
         Do
He had a toothache
           La
He started crying
                   Do
It sounded like an earthquake
          La
It didn't last long
          Do
Because I stopped it
            Si
I grabbed a rag doll
                      La#
And stuck some little pins in it

            La
Now we're a family
            Do
And we're alright now
       La
We got money and a little place
   Do
To fight now
         La
We don't know you
             Do
And we don't owe you
           Si
But if you see us around
      La#
I got something else to show you

         La                  Do
Now it's easy when you don't know better
               La
You think it's sleazy?
                 Do
Then put it in a short letter
        La
We keep warm
                           Do
But there's just something wrong with you
     Si
Just feel that you're the hardest
       La#
little button to button
       La
I had opinions
            Do
That didn't matter
        La
I had a brain
               Do
That felt like pancake batter
        La
I got a backyard
             Do
With nothing in it
         Si
Except a stick

A dog
      La#
And a box with something in it

La4             Do
    The hardest button to button
La4             Do
    The hardest button to button
La4             Do
    The hardest button to button
La4             Do
    The hardest button to button ...

Si   La#   La4   Do   La4   Do

La4
    The hardest button to button
Do
    The hardest button to button
La4
    The hardest button to button
Do                                La4
    The hardest button to button
