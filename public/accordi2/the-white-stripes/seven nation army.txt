[<pre>          Mim            Sol Do Si
I'm gonna fight 'em off
               Mim            Sol       Do    Si
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
              Mim         Sol Do Si
They're gonna rip it off
             Mim           Sol       Do    Si
Taking their time right behind my back
        Mim           Sol       Do
And I'm talking to myself at night
          Si        Mim  Sol Do Si
Because I can't forget
Mim             Sol          Do
Back and forth through my mind
         Si   Mim    Sol Do Si
Behind a cigarette
      Sol                      La
And a message coming from my eyes says leave it alone


Mim Sol Do Si x4
Lam Si Mi


          Mim            Sol Do Si
Don't want to hear about it
               Mim            Sol       Do    Si
Every single one's got a story to tell
          Mim            Sol Do Si
Everyone knows about it
               Mim            Sol       Do    Si
From the Queen of England to the hounds of Hell
          Mim            Sol Do Si
And if I catch it coming back my way
               Mim            Sol       Do    Si
I'm gonna serve it to you
          Mim            Sol Do Si
And that ain't what you want to hear
               Mim            Sol       Do    Si
But that's what I'll do
      Sol                      La
And a feeling coming from my bones says find a home


          Mim            Sol Do Si
I'm going to Wichita
               Mim            Sol       Do    Si
Far from this opera, forever more
          Mim            Sol Do Si
I'm going to work the straw
               Mim            Sol       Do    Si
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
          Mim            Sol Do Si
And I'm bleeding and I'm bleeding and I'm bleeding
               Mim            Sol       Do    Si
Right before the Lord
          Mim            Sol Do Si
All the words are going to bleed from me
               Mim            Sol       Do    Si
And I will think no more
        Sol                     La
And the stains coming from my blood tell me go back home</pre>]
