Wake up in the morning with a head like 'what you done?'

This used to be the life, but I don't need another one

You like cuttin' up and carrying on, you wear them gowns

So how come I feel so lonely when you're up getting down?
    Sim7                  Fa#m
So I'll play along when I hear that special song
Lam7                             Sol
I'm gonna be the one who gets it right

You'd better move when you're swingin' 'round the room
Lam7                               Sol
Looks like the magic's only ours tonight

But I don't feel like dancin'

When the old Joanna plays
   Sol
My heart could take a chance

But my two feet can't find a way
                 La
You'd think that I could muster
            Do7              Sol
up a little soft-shoe gentle sway
    Re
But I don't feel like dancin'

No, sir, no dancin' today

Don't feel like dancin', dancin'

Even if I find nothin' better to do
                Sol
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'

Why'd you pick a tune when I'm not in the mood?
                La
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'

I'd rather be home with the one in the bed 'til dawn with you,

Cities come and cities go just like the old empires

When all you do is change your clothes and call that versatile

You got so many colours, make a blind man so confused
   Sol              Sol4               Sol           Sol4 Sol
So why can't I keep up when you're the only thing I lose?
    Sim7                     Fa#m
So, I'll just pretend that I know which way to bend
Lam7                                        Sol
I'm gonna tell the whole world that you're mine
    Sim7                      Fa#m
So, please understand, when I see you clap your hands
   Lam7                                   Sol
If you stick around I'm sure that I'll be fine

You can't make me dance around
    Re6                 Re7
But your two-step makes my chest pound
            Sol         Solm               La
Just lay me down as you float away into the shimmer light
