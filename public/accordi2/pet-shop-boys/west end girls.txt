 Sometimes you’re better off dead

There’s a gun in your hand and it’s pointing at your head
    Lam7
You think you’re mad, too unstable

kicking in chairs and knocking down tables
     Mim9
in a restaurant in a West End town

Call the police! There’s a madman around
Lam9
Running down underground

to a dive bar in a West End town
     Sim7
In a West End town, a dead end world
                      Lam9
the East End boys and West End girls

West End    girls

Mim9
Too many shadows, whispering voices

faces on posters, too many choices
Lam9
If? When? Why? What?

How much have you got?
         Mim9
Have you got it? Do you get it?

If so, how often?

Which do you choose
                       Lam9
a hard or soft option?

(How much do you need?)

You got a heart of glass or a heart of stone?

Just you wait ’til I get you home
      Lam9
We’ve got no future, we’ve got no past

Here today, built to last
   Mim9
In every city, in every nation

from Lake Geneva to the Finland station
Lam9
 (How far have you been?)
      Sim7
And a West End town, a dead end world
