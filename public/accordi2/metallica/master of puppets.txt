end of passion play, crumbling away

i'm your source of self-destruction

veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear

leading on your death's construction

hell is worth all that, natural habitat

just a rhyme without a reason

never-ending maze, drift on numbered days

now your life is out of season
