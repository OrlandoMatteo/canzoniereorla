 The thrill is gone

The thrill is gone away
Mim7
 The thrill is gone baby
               Sim
The thrill is gone away

 You know you done me wrong baby
               Sim
And you'll be sorry someday

Sim
 The thrill is gone
                       Mim7
It's gone away from me

The thrill is gone baby
              Sim                Sol
The thrill is gone away from me
                           Fa#7
Although, I'll still live on
       Sim
But so lonely I'll be

 The thrill is gone

It's gone away for good

It's gone away for good

Someday I know I'll be open armed baby
            Sim
Just like I know a good man should

You know I'm free, free now baby
                          Mim7
I'm free from your spell

Oh I'm free, free, free now
        Sim
I'm free from your spell
    Sol                    Fa#7
And now that it's all over
          Sim
All I can do is wish you well
