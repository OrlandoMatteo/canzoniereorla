Re#5
 Behold the King

The King of Kings
                   Re#5
On your knees dog
          Si5
All hail
                Do#5
Bow down to the
                Re#5     Si5
Bow down to the King
                 Do#5
Bow down to the
                Re#
Bow down to the King

The King grinned red
      Fa#5
As he walked from the place
          Do#5                  Sol#5
Where the traitor lost both his name and his face
            Re#5
Through the halls and the corridors
Fa#5
Stinging in blood
   Do#5                   Sol#5
He tasted his grin and it tasted good
                  Re#5   Fa#5
The King took his head
         Sol#5      Re#5   Fa#5   Sol#5
Left him broken and dead

Si5               Do#5
 Bow down to the
                Re#5
Bow down to the King
Si5               Do#5
 Bow down to the
                Re#5
Bow down to the King
Si5               Do#5
 Bow down to the
                Re#5
Bow down to the King


The King left none living
     Fa#5
None able to tell
    Do#5
The King took their heads
       Sol#5
And he sent them to hell
      Re#5
Their screams echoed loud
       Fa#5
In the place of their death
       Do#5
Ripped open they died
           Sol#5
With their final breath
                Re#5  Fa#5
They hailed the King
        Sol#5      Re#5  Fa#5  Sol#5
The King of Kings

Si5               Do#5
 Bow down to the
                Re#5
Bow down to the King
Si5               Do#5
 Bow down to the
                Re#5
Bow down to the King
Si5               Do#5
 Bow down to the
                Re#5
Bow down to the King

Into the dirt

His will be done

Now feel your fear
                       Fa#5  Do#5
There can be only one
