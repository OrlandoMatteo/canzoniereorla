        Fa#5    Si

Fa#5
 I'm living on an endless road

Around the world for rock and roll

Sometimes it feels so tough

But I still ain't had enough

I keep saying that it's getting to much

But I know I'm a liar
Mi5         Si5          Fa#5
Feeling all right in the noise and the light
    Mi5         Si5
But that's what lights my fire

    Fa#5   La5     Mi5         Si5
Hellraiser, In the thunder and heat
    Fa#5   La5       Mi5          Si5
Hellraiser, Rock you back in your seat
  Fa#5   La5         Mi5          Si5
Hellraiser, And I'll make it come true
    La5    Mi5                   Fa#5    Si
Hellraiser,  I'll put a spell on you

Fa#5
 Walking out on another stage

Another town, another place

Sometimes I don't feel right

Nerves wound up to damn tight

Don't you tell me it's bad for my health

'Cos kicking back don't make it
Mi5       Si5              Fa#5
Out of control, I play the ultimate role
Mi5       Si5
Don't know how to fake it

    Fa#5   La5     Mi5         Si5
Hellraiser, In the thunder and heat
    Fa#5   La5       Mi5          Si5
Hellraiser, Rock you back in your seat
  Fa#5   La5         Mi5          Si5
Hellraiser, And I'll make it come true
    La5    Mi5                   Fa#5       La5 Mi5 Si5 La5
Hellraiser,  I'll put a spell on you

Fa#5  La5  Mi5  Si5    Fa#5  La5  Mi5  Si5
