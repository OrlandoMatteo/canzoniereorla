It's all about the game, and how you play it

All about control, and if you can take it

All about your debt, and if you can pay it

It's all about pain, and who's gonna make it

I am the game, you don't wanna play me

I am control, no way you can change me

I have heavy debts, no way you can pay me

I am the pain, and I know you can't take me

Look over your shoulder, ready to run
       Mi5                     Sol5    La5
Like a Cleaveland bitch from a smoking gun!
  Mi5              Sol5      La5
I am the game and I make the rules
   Mi5                    Sol5       La5
So move on outta here and die like a fool
Mi5                       Sol5         La5
Try to figure out what my move's gonna be
     Mi5                  Sol5          La5
Come on over, sucker, why don't you ask me?
Mi5                        Sol5          La5
Don't you forget there's a price you can pay
      Mi5               Sol5      La5
Cause I am the game and I want to play
