Love is like a bomb, baby, c'mon get it on
Livin' like a lover with a radar phone
Lookin' like a tramp, like a video vamp
Demolition woman, can I be your man?

Do#5
Razzle 'n' a dazzle 'n' a flash a little light
Television lover, baby, go all night
Sometime, anytime, sugar me sweet
Little miss ah innocent sugar me, yeah

Hey! C'mon..
Fa#      Si      Fa#        Si
  Take a bottle... shake it up

Mi          La      Mi         Si
  Break the bubble... break it up

Mi        La       Si
Pour some sugar on me, ooh, in the name of love
Mi        La       Si
Pour some sugar on me, c'mon, fire me up

Red light, yellow light, green-a-light go!
Crazy little woman in a one man show
Mirror queen, mannequin, rhythm of love
Sweet dream, saccharine, loosen up

          Do#5
You gotta squeeze a little, squeeze a little
Tease a little more
Easy operator come a knockin' on my door
Sometime, anytime, sugar me sweet
Little miss innocent sugar me, yeah, yeah
Give a little more!

You got the peaches, I got the cream
Sweet to taste, saccharine

From my head, my head, to my feet
