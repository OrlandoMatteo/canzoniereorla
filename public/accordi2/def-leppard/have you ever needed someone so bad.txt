       Mi  Laadd9  Mi  Laadd9

Mi                     Laadd9
 Here I am, I'm in the wrong bed again
Mi                        Laadd9
 It's a game I just can't win
Mi                       Laadd9
 There you are breathin' soft on my skin
Mi                       Laadd9
 Still you won't let me in
            Si
So come on
                           La    Mi   Si
Why save your kisses for a rainy day
                              La     Mi
Baby let the moment take your heart away

         Do#m7       La         Si
Have you ever needed someone so bad
         Mi                   Si
Have you ever wanted someone
    Laadd9
You just couldn't have
        Do#m7             Mi
Did you ever try so hard
          Laadd9
That your world just fell apart
         Do#m7       Si         Laadd9
Have you ever needed someone so bad

And you're the girl I gotta have
        Mi             Laadd9
I gotta have you baby

Come on

Mi                      Laadd9
 There you go, midnight promises again
Mi                          Laadd9
 But they're broken by the dawn
Mi                     Laadd9
 You wanna go further, faster every day, baby
Mi                             Laadd9
 But in the morning you'll be gone
              Si
And I'm alone
                           La    Mi   Si
Why save your kisses for a rainy day
                              La     Mi
Baby let the moment take your heart away

         Do#m7       La         Si
Have you ever needed someone so bad
         Mi                   Si
Have you ever wanted someone
    Laadd9
You just couldn't have
        Do#m7             Mi
Did you ever try so hard
          Laadd9
That your world just fell apart
         Do#m7       Si         Laadd9
Have you ever needed someone so bad

Si5   Mi5 La5  Mi5 Si5   La5 Mi5

Si5            Mi5     La5
 Every dream I dream
                            Mi5
is like some kinda rash and reckless scene
Si5                     Mi5    La5
 To give out such crazy love
                       Mi5
You must be some kinda drug
Si5                        Mi5    La5
 And if my time don't ever come
                         Mi5
For me you're still the one
Si
Damned if I don't, damned if I do

I gotta get a fix on you

         Do#m7       La         Si
Have you ever needed someone so bad
         Mi                   Si
Have you ever wanted someone
    Laadd9
You just couldn't have
        Do#m7             Mi
Did you ever try so hard
          Laadd9
That your world just fell apart
         Do#m7       Si          Laadd9
Have you ever needed someone so bad

And you're the girl I gotta have
        Mi             Laadd9
I gotta have you baby

Mi          Laadd9                  Mi   Laadd9
   Have you ever needed someone so bad,
         Mi                  Laadd9
Have you ever wanted someone...
