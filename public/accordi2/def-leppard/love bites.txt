When you make love, do you look in the mirror?
                 Do4                   Faadd9
Who do you think of, does he look like me?
            Rem7                     Solm9
Do you tell lies and say that it's forever?
             Do4                      Faadd9
Do you think twice, or just touch 'n' see?
    Rem
Ooh babe
    Fa
ooh yeah

             Rem7             Solm9
When you're alone, do you let go?
                 Do4                       Faadd9
Are you wild 'n' willin' or is it just for show?

Ooh c'mon

When I'm with you are you somewhere else?
             Do4                       Faadd9
Am I gettin' thru or do you please yourself?
              Rem7             Solm9
When you wake up will you walk out?
            Do4                   Faadd9
It can't be love if you throw it about

Ooh babe
