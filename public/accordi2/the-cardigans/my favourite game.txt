       Dom  La#  Fa   Sol# La#

Dom                       La#
 I don't know what you're looking for
Fa                          Sol#        La#
 you haven't found it baby, that's for sure
Dom                          La#
 You rip me up and spread me all around
Fa                  Sol#     La#
 in the dust of the deed of time

Dom  La#  Fa  Sol# La#

Dom                        La#
 And this is not a case of lust, you see
Fa                    Sol#     La#
 it's not a matter of you versus me
Dom                           La#
 It's fine the way you want me on your own
Fa                   Sol#        La#
 but in the end it's always me alone

        Dom                 La#/Do   Solm La#
And I'm losing my favourite game
       Dom               La#/Do   Solm  La#
you're losing your mind again
    Dom       Sol#
I'm losing my baby
Fa        La#       Sol
losing my favourite game

Dom  La#  Fa  Sol# La#

Dom  La#  Fa  Sol# La#

Dom                         La#
 I only know what I've been working for
Fa                      Sol#      La#
 another you so I could love you more
Dom                          La#
 I really thought that I could take you there
Fa                    Sol#            La#
 but my experiment is not getting us anywhere

Dom  La#  Fa  Sol# La#

Dom                     La#
 I had a vision I could turn you right
Fa                      Sol#    La#
 a stupid mission and a lethal fight
Dom                            La#
 I should have seen it when my hope was new
Fa/La                     Sol#     La#
 my heart is black and my body is blue

        Dom                 La#/Do   Solm  La#
And I'm losing my favourite game
       Dom              La#/Do   Solm  La#
you're losing your mind again
    Dom       Sol#       La#   Solm  La#
I'm losing my favourite game
       Dom         Sol#   La#   Solm  La#
You're losing your mind again
    Dom       Sol#   Fa        La#       Sol
I'm losing my baby, losing my favourite game

Dom  La#  Fa  Sol# La#

    Dom       Sol#       Dom   Sol#6
I'm losing my favourite game
       Dom         Sol#   Dom   Sol#6
You're losing your mind again
     Dom              Sol#       Dom   Sol#6
I've tried but you're still the same
              Sol#
I'm losing my baby
       Fa       La#           Sol
You're losing a saviour and a saint
