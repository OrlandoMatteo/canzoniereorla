Dom           La#              Sol#    
"There must be some kind of way out of here,"  
     La#    Dom         La#           Sol#  
said the joker to the thief,
La# Dom        La#          Sol#
"There's too much confusion,    
    La# Dom        La#       Sol#    La#
I can't get no relief.
Dom       La#        Sol#     
Businessmen, they drink my wine,  
  La#    Dom       La#     Sol#     La#
plowmen dig my earth,
Dom        La#    Sol#       La#   Dom  
None of them along the line  
        La#           Sol#      La#
 know what any of it is worth."


Dom           La#              Sol#   
"No reason to get excited," the thief, 
      La#    Dom        La#     Sol#   La#
he kindly spoke,
Dom        La#          Sol#  
"There are many here among us 
  La# Dom        La#       Sol#    La#
who feel that life is but a joke.
Dom       La#        Sol#   
But you and I, we've been through that, 
    La#    Dom       La#     Sol#     La#
and this is not our fate,
Dom        La#    Sol#     
So let us not talk falsely now,
  La#   Dom   La#   Sol#   La#
the hour is getting late."


Dom           La#                       
All along the watchtower, 
Sol#    La# Dom  La#   Sol#  La#
princes kept the view
Dom        La#          Sol#   
While all the women came and 
La#  Dom  La#  Sol#  La#
went, barefoot servants, too.
Dom       La#        Sol#       La#    Dom   
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
La#  Sol#  La#
Dom        La#    Sol#      
Two riders were approaching, 
La#      Dom      La#     Sol#   La#
the wind began to howl</pre>]
