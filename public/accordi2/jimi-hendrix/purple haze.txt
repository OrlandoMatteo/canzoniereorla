       Mi7   Sol La   Mi7   Sol La


Mi7#9           Sol         La
 Purple haze all in my brain
Mi7#9                    Sol        La
 Lately things just don't seem the same
Mi7#9               Sol         La
 Actin' funny, but I don't know why
Mi7#9
 'Scuse me while I kiss the sky

Mi7#9       Sol     La
 Purple haze all around
Mi7#9                     Sol     La
 Don't know if I'm comin' up or down
Mi7#9         Sol     La
 Am I happy or in misery?
   Mi7#9
Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me

La5       Si5

Mi7#9           Sol      La
 Purple haze all in my eyes
Mi7#9              Sol     La
 Don't know if it's day or night
Mi7#9                 Sol         La
 You've got me blowin, blowin my mind
 Mi7#9
