Well she's walking, through the clouds
       Sol#m7                     Re#m
With a circus mind that's running wild
La#m7                       Lam7 Sol#m7     Si   Fa#
  Butterfiles and zebras and moonbeams, and fairytales
                          Si                  Do#
All she ever thinks about  is riding with the wind.

         Re#m             Fa#
When I'm sad she comes to me
       Sol#m7                          Re#m
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free
La#m7                            Lam7 Sol#m7     Si   Fa#
  It's alright it's alright she says.... it's alright
Si                Fa#
Take anything you want from me.. anything
Si   Do#
     Anything!

Fly little wing...
