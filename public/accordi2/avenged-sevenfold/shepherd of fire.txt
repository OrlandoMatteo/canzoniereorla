 Let's take a moment and break the ice
                     La#   Solm Rem
So my intentions are known

See I have pity in watching you suffer
                      La#   Solm    La

I've got a storybook of my own
Rem           Do        La#

Agent of wealth
          Rem
Bearer of needs?

(And you know it's right)
          La#
I am your war
           Do
Arming the strong
           Rem
Aiding the weak

No need to serve on your knees

And when you're lost in the darkest of hours
                  La#     Solm    La
Take a moment and tell me who you see
      La#          Solm   La
Won't tell you who not to be

Now you know I am your pride

Agent of wealth

"Disciple of the cross and champion in suffering

Immerse yourself into the kingdom of redemption

Harden your mind through the chains of the divine

Make way the shepherd of fire"
La                    La# Solm La
 Through the ages of time
                        La# Solm La
I've been known for my hate
                     La#    Solm   La
But I'm a dealer of simple choices

For me it's never too late
          La#

Arming the strong
           Rem
Aiding the weak
          La#
I am your wrath
          Do
I am your guilt
          Rem
I am your lust

(And you know it's right)
          La#
I am your law
          Do
I am your star
         Rem
I am your trust
           Do
Know me by name
