 Fa        Do             Rem                 Lam
A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
La#                Fa            Do
Miles away from those I love purpose hard to find
Fa          Do           Rem                 Lam
While I recall all the words you spoke to me
      La#                  Fa
Can't help but wish that I was there
      Do
Back where I'd love to be, oh yeah


Fa    Do       Rem          Do
Dear God the only thing I ask of you is
    La#                      Fa
to hold her when I'm not around,
          Do
when I'm much too far away
Fa        Do         Rem           Do
We all need that person who can be true to you
       La#               Fa
But I left her when I found her
    Do
And now I wish I'd stayed
            La#             Do
’Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
      Lam          Rem  Do  La#
I'm missing you again oh no
           Fa
Once again


Fa                Do          Rem              Lam
There's nothing here for me on this barren road
        La#                         Fa
There's no one here while the city sleeps
      Do
and all the shops are closed
Fa               Do            Rem                 Lam
Can't help but think of the times I've had with you
La#                 Fa              Do
Pictures and some memories will have to help me through, oh yeah

We all need that person who can be true to you
   La#               Fa
I left her when I found her
    Do         
And now I wish I'd stayed
           La#              Do
’Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
       Lam         Rem   Do  La#
I'm missing you again oh no
          Fa
Once again


Rem     La7     La#               Fa
Some search, never finding a way
Rem      La7  La#             Fa
Before long, they waste away
Rem      La7  La#                      Fa
I found you, something told me to stay
Rem    La7  La#               Fa
I gave in, to selfish ways
Solm                         Do
And how I miss someone to hold

when hope begins to fade...
