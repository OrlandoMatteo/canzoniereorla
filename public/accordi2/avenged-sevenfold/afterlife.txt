     Rem                                         Fa   Sol5 Sol#5
Like walking into a dream, so unlike what you've seen
Rem                                       Fa        Sol5 Sol#5
So unsure but it seems, ’cause we’ve been waiting for you
Rem                                             Fa  Sol5 Sol#5
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
        Rem                                              Fa  Sol5 Sol#5
Of your afterlife here so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway
Rem              Do    Rem                     Do
 I see a distant light, but girl this can't be right
Rem                      Do                  La#
 Such a surreal place to see so how did this come to be
  Do        Do#dim
Arrived too early

Rem         Fa               La#           Do
 And when I think of all the places I just don't belong
Rem           Fa                  La#             Do          Fa
 I've come to grips with life and realize this is going too far

          Do                       Rem
I don't belong here, we gotta move on dear
  La#            Fa
Escape from this afterlife
            Do                     Rem
’Cause this time I'm right to move on and on
La#
Far away from here

Rem                                                Fa  Sol5 Sol#5
A place of hope and no pain, perfect skies with no rain
Rem                                                 Fa      Sol5 Sol#5
Can leave this place but refrain, ’cause we've been waiting for you
Rem                                             Fa   Sol5 Sol#5
Fallen into this place, just giving you a small taste
Rem                                                      Fa    Sol5 Sol#5
Of your afterlife here so stay, you'll be back here soon anyway
Rem                        Do
 This peace on earth's not right (with my back against the wall)
Rem                 Do
 No pain or sign of time (I’m much too young to fall)
Rem                          Do
 So out of place don't wanna stay,
             La#
I feel wrong and that's my sign
     Do      Do#dim
I've made up my mind

Rem           Fa              La#          Do
 Give me your hand but realize I just wanna say goodbye
Rem           Fa              La#             Do          Fa
  Please understand I have to leave and carry on my own life

          Do                       Rem
I don't belong here, we gotta move on dear
  La#            Fa
Escape from this afterlife
            Do                     Rem
’Cause this time I'm right to move on and on
La#              Fa
Far away from here
             Do                         Rem
Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you
     La#           Fa                       Do
This place full of peace and light, and I’d hope you might
        Rem         La#
Take me back inside when the time is right
