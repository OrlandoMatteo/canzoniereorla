 I guess now it's time   for me to give up
Solm7         La#  Do La#/Re Do/Mi
  I feel it's time
      Fa               Solm7
Got a picture of you beside me
         La#                 Do             Fa
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
Solm7  La#  Do4 Do

      Fa            Solm7
Got a fist of pure emotion
      La#               Do
Got a head of shattered dreams
      Rem             Do6            La#     Do4 Do
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now

 Unaware but underlined  I figured out this story
Solm7       La#  Do La#/Re Do/Mi
 It wasn't good
           Fa           Solm7 La#  Do
But in the corner of my mind
             Fa
I celebrated glory
Solm7      La#        Do4 Do
  But that was not to be
       Fa           Solm7         La#            Do
In the twist of separation you excelled at being free
          Rem           Do6             La#  Do4 Do
Can't you find a little room inside for me

We'll be fighting and forever we will be
      Rem          Do
So complete in our love

We will never be uncovered again
