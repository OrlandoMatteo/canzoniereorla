Re
Standing
                 Sol
On the edge of forever
                   Sim
At the start of whatever
                     Fa#m
Shouting love at the world
Re
Back then
            Sol
We were like cavemen
                  Sim
But we mapped the moon and the stars
           Fa#m
Then we forgave them
Mim              Sol
 We will meet you  where the lights are
Sim           Fa#m
 The defenders  of the faith we are
Mim
When the thunder turns around
        Sol                                Sim
They'll run so hard we'll tear the ground away
         Do#m7b5 Si/Re#
You know no one   dies
         Mim          Si/Fa#
In these love-drowned eyes
            Sol6         Si
Through our love-drowned eyes
             Fa#7sus4       Fa#
We'll watch you sleep tonight

Sol                  Re
Although no one understood,
                         Sim
we were holding back the flood
                        Fa#m
Learning how to dance the rain
Sol                      Re
We were holding back the flood
                            La
They said we'd never dance again

Re
Bleeding
              Sol
But none of us leaving
             Sim
Watch your mouth, son
                        Fa#m
Or you'll find yourself floating home
Mim              Sol
 Here we come now  on a dark star
Sim           Fa#m
 Seeing demons,  not what we are
Mim
Tiny minds and eager hands
     Sol                              Sim
Will try to strike but now will end today
        Do#m7b5 Si/Re#
There's progress now
            Mim      Si/Fa#
Where there once was none
            Sol6      Si
Where there once was, ah
                Fa#7sus4  Fa#7
Then everything came along

Although no one understood

there was more of them than us

Now we'll never dance again
