[<pre>Sol  Mim  Do  Re

Sol                 Mim
What a beautiful face
                       Do
I have found in this place
                  Re 
that is circling all around the sun.
Sol                  Mim
What a beautiful dream
                          Do
that could flash on the screen
                  Re                    Sol
in a blink of an eye and be gone from me
      Mim 
soft and sweet
       Do               Re              Sol  Mim  Do  Re
let me hold it close and keep it here with me




Sol                 Mim
and one day we will die
                       Do                  Re
and our ashes will fly from the aeroplane over the sea
Sol                  Mim
but for now we are young
                  Do
let us lay in the sun
                Re                     Sol
and count every beautiful thing we can see
        Mim
Love to be
         Do             Re               Sol Mim Do Re
in the arms of all I'm keepin here with me


Mim  Do  Sol  Re
Mim  Do  Sol  Re  Re



Sol               Mim                       Do
what a curious life we have found here tonight
                    Re
there is music that sounds from the street
Sol                       Mim
there are lights in the cloud
                   Do
Anna's ghost all around
                       Re                   Sol
hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me
      Mim
soft and sweet
        Do                Re           Sol  Mim  Do  Re
How the notes all bend and reach above the trees

Mim                        Do
     now how I remember you
                                  Sol
how I would push my fingers through
                                    Re
your mouth to make those muscles move
                                       Mim
that make your voice so smooth and sweet
                                  Do
And now we keep where we don't know
                                  Sol
All secrets sleep in winter clothes
                             Re
with one you loved so long ago

now he don't even know his name


Mim  Do  Sol  Re

Sol                 Mim
What a beautiful face
                       Do
I have found in this place
                  Re
that is circling all around the sun.
Sol                     Mim
And when we meet on a cloud
                     Do
I'll be laughing out loud
                      Re           Sol
I'll be laughing with everyone I see
       Mim
Can't believe
   Do                 Re        Sol  Mim  Do  Re  Sol
how strange it is to be anything at all</pre>]
