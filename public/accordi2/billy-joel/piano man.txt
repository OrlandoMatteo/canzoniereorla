It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
    Fa       Do              Re7 Sol
The regular crowd shuffles in
           Do       Sol       Fa       Do
There's an old man sitting next to me
       Fa           Sol         Do   Sol
Making love to his tonic and gin

          Do            Sol         Fa   Do
He says, "Son, can you play me a memory
    Fa          Do           Re7  Sol
I'm not really sure how it goes
         Do            Sol           Fa          Do
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
     Fa        Sol             Do
When I wore a younger man's clothes."

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Fa         Do      Re7   Sol
Sing us a song tonight
            Do          Sol          Fa   Do
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
    Fa                 Sol         Do     Sol
And you've got us all feeling alright



    Do           Sol        Fa         Do
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
   Fa          Do          Re7  Sol
He gets me my drinks for free
         Do            Sol              Fa            Do
And he's quick with a joke and he'll light up your smoke
            Fa               Sol           Do   Sol
But there's some place that he'd rather be

          Do         Sol             Fa       Do
He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me."
       Fa          Do            Re7  Sol
As the smile ran away from his face
          Do           Sol          Fa     Do
"Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
   Fa           Sol           Do
If I could get out of this place"

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
    Fa         Do          Re7  Sol
Who never had time for a wife
         Do            Sol           Fa            Do
And he's talking with Davy, who's still in the Navy
    Fa             Sol      Do   Sol
And probably will be for life

        Do           Sol          Fa   Do
And the waitress is practicing politics
       Fa           Do           Re7    Sol
As the businessman slowly gets stoned
             Do         Sol               Fa     Do
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
         Fa           Sol         Do    Sol
But it's better than drinking alone



Do         Sol                Fa     Do

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
        Fa       Do          Re7    Sol
And the manager gives me a smile
          Do               Sol               Fa      Do
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see
   Fa            Sol           Do   Sol
To forget about life for a while

        Do         Sol             Fa    Do
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
        Fa          Do             Re7  Sol
And the microphone smells like a beer
         Do          Sol           Fa           Do
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
          Fa             Sol         Do     Sol
And say, "Man, what are you doing here?"
