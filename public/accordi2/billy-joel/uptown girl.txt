Mi          Fa#m7
Uptown girl
                         Mi/Sol#
She's been living in her uptown world
La         La/Si       Mi
 I bet she never had a backstreet guy
Fa#m7                 Mi/Sol#
 I bet her mama never told her why
La         La/Si      Mi
 I'm gonna try for an uptown girl
Fa#m7                     Mi/Sol#
 She's been living in her white bread world
La          La/Si       Mi
 As long as anyone with hot blood can
Fa#m7                        Mi/Sol#
 And now she's looking for a downtown man
La           Si
 That's what I am

Do            Lam7
 And when she knows what
    Rem7           Sol
She wants from her time
Do            Lam7
 And when she wakes up
    Sim7b5      Mi7
And makes up her mind

La              Fa#m7
 She'll see I'm not so tough
Sim7
Just because

Si7                 Mi
I'm in love with an uptown girl
Fa#m7                          Mi/Sol#
 You know I've seen her in her uptown world
La             La/Si        Mi
 She's getting tired of her high class toys
Fa#m7                          Mi/Sol#
 And all her presents from her uptown boys
La           Si
 She's got a choice

Sol  La  Fa#7/La# Sim  La

Sol  La  Fa#7/La# Si

Mi          Fa#m7
Uptown girl
                           Mi/Sol#
You know I can't afford to buy her pearls
La         La/Si           Mi
 But maybe someday when my ship comes in
Fa#m7                           Mi/Sol#
 She'll understand what kind of guy I've been
La             Si
 And then I'll win

Do              Lam7
 And when she's walking
      Rem7       Sol
She's looking so fine
Do              Lam7
 And when she's talking
       Sim7b5        Mi7
She'll say that she's mine

La              Fa#m7
 She'll see I'm not so tough
Sim7
Just because
