Re# La#/Re Dom7 La# Sol#         Re#
If  you    said goodbye to me tonight
      La#/Re Dom7  La# Lam7b5 Fa7     La#
There would  still be  music   left to write
Sol7             Dom
 What else could I do
La#7/Re   Re#    Re#7
 I'm so inspired by you
Sol#          Fam7             La#7    Re#
 That hasn't happened for the longest time

Re#  La#/Re Dom7    La# Sol#           Re#
Once I      thought my  innocence was gone
    La#/Re Dom7 La#  Lam7b5 Fa7       La#
Now I      know that happi---ness goes on
Sol7              Dom
 That's where you found me
La#7/Re           Re#    Re#7
When you put your arms around me
Sol#        Fam7               La#7    Re#
 I haven't been there for the longest time

Re# La#/Re Dom7  La#    Sol#            Re#
I'm that   voice you're hearing in the hall
    La#/Re Dom7 La#  Lam7b5 Fa7   La#
And the    grea-test mira----cle of  all
Sol7      Dom
 Is how I need you
La#7/Re      Re#       Re#7
 And how you needed me too
Sol#          Fam7             La#7    Re#
 That hasn't happened for the longest time

La#              Dom
Maybe this won't last very long
    Re7
But you feel so right
    Re#
And I could be wrong
Solm            Dom
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
    Fa7
But I've gone this far
         La#         La#7
And it's more than I hoped for

Re# La#/Re Dom7 La#  Sol#              Re#
Who knows  how  much further we'll go on
   La#/Re Dom7 La# Lam7b5 Fa7         La#
Maybe     I'll be  sorry   when you're gone
Sol7          Dom
 I'll take my chances
La#7/Re      Re#    Re#7
I forgot how nice romance is
Sol#        Fam7               La#7    Re#
 I haven't been there for the longest time

La#          Dom
I had second thoughts at the start
  Re7
I said to myself
     Re#
Hold on to your heart
Solm           Dom
Now I know the woman that you are
       Fa7
You're wonderful so far
         La#         La#7
And it's more than I hoped for

Re# La#/Re Dom7 La#  Sol#            Re#
I   don't  care what consequence it brings
  La#/Re Dom7 La# Lam7b5  Fa7    La#
I have   been a   fool for lesser things
Sol7        Dom
 I want you so bad
La#7/Re      Re#      Re#7
 I think you ought to know
     Sol#         Fam7             La#7    Re#
That I intend to hold you for the longest time

Re#   La# Re# Sol#
Woah, oh, oh, oh
La#             Re#
For the longest time
La#   Re# Sol#
Woah, oh, oh

For the longest time
La#   Re# Sol#
Woah, oh, oh...
