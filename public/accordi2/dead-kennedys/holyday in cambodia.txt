    So you been to school

    For a year or two

    And you know you've seen it all

    In daddy's car

    Thinkin' you'll go far

    To parade your snazz
            Sol            Re
    On your five-grand stereo
    Sol
    Braggin' that you know
            Re
    How the niggers feel cold
            Sol               Re
    And the slums got so much soul
                 Do         Sol Do   Lam
    It's time to taste what you most fear
    Re          Do       Sol  Do  Lam

    You're a star-belly sneetch

    You suck like a leech

    You want everyone to act like you

    Kiss ass while you bitch

    So you can get rich

    But your boss gets richer off you
         Sol
    Well you'll work harder
           Re
    With a gun in your back
          Sol            Re
    For a bowl of rice a day
    Sol
    Slave for soldiers
    Re
    Till you starve
              Sol                   Re
    Then your head is skewered on a stake
                Do       Sol    Do  Lam
    Now you can go where people are one
    Re          Do            Sol  Do    Lam
