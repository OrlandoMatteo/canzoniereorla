       Fa  Do7  Fa  Do7

        Fa
I got a feelin' called the blues, oh Lord
                       Do7
Since my baby said goodbye

Lord I don't know what I'll do
                    Fa
All I do is sit and sigh, oh Lord
               La#
That last long day she said goodbye
     Fa                     Re7
Well lord I thought I would cry
       Sol7
She'll do me, she'll do you

She's got that kind of lovin'
Do7
Lord I love to hear her when
                   Fa
she calls me sweet da-a-addy
                 Do7
Such a beautiful dream

I hate to think it's all over
                      La7
I've lost my heart it seems
              La#            Sol#dim
I've grown so used to you somehow
         Fa             Re7
Well I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
        Sol7          Do7
And I'm lo-o-onesome
                   Fa
I got the lovesick blues

            La7                     Rem
Well I'm in love I'm in love with a beautiful gal
La7                            Rem
 That's what's the matter with me
            La7                     Rem
Well I'm in love I'm in love with a beautiful gal
    Sol7                 Do7
But she don't care about me

Lord I tried and tried, to keep her satisfied
    Fa
But she just wouldn't stay
   Sol7
So now that she is leavin'
                  Do7
This is all I can say

        Fa
I got a feelin' called the blues, oh Lord
                       Do7
Since my baby said goodbye

Lord I don't know what I'll do

All I do is sit and sigh, oh Lord
