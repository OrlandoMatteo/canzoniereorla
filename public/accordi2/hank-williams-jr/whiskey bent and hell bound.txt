        Sol  Re7  Sol

                Sol           Sol7
I've got a good woman at home
    Do             Sol
Who thinks I do no wrong
                                            Re7
But sometimes, Lord, she just ain't always around
                    Sol    Sol7
And you know that's when I fall
            Do             Sol
Now I can't help myself at all
                  Re7            Sol
And I get whiskey bent and hell bound
                                      Sol7
Play me some songs about a ramblin man
      Do             Sol
Put a cold one in my hand
                                           Re7
Cause you know I love to hear those guitar sounds
                       Sol              Sol7
Don't you play, I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry
               Do              Sol
Cause I'll get all balled up inside
                     Re7           Sol
And I'll get whiskey bent and hell bound

Sol   Sol7 Do   Sol   Re7  Sol

                  Sol      Sol7
Sure enough about closin time
      Do               Sol
About stoned out of my mind
                                           Re7
And I end up with some honkytonk special I found
                    Sol         Sol7
Just as sure as the mornin sun comes
           Do               Sol
Thinkin of my sweet girl at home
                          Re7           Sol
And I need to get whiskey bent and hell bound
                                 Sol7
Play me the songs about ramblin man
     Do                Sol
Put old Jim Beam in my hand

Cause you know I still love to get drunk
                 Re7
And hear country sounds
                         Sol       Sol7
But don't you play, Your Cheatin Heart
              Do           Sol
Cause that'll tear me all apart
                 Re7           Sol
I'll get whiskey bent and hell bound

Yeah, old Hank's songs
       Re7              Sol
Always make me feel low down
