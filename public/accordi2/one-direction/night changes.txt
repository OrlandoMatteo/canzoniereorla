Going out tonight, changes into something red
Mim
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Sim
Everything she never had
              Re
She’s showing off
Sol
Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
Mim
She said it was something that she won’t forget
Sim                                         Re          
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

We're only getting older baby
Do                      Re
And I've been thinking about it lately
Do            Re
Does it ever drive you crazy
Sol        Re        Mim
Just how fast the night changes
Do                      Re
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Do            Re
Disappearing when you wake up
Do                      Re
But there’s nothing to be afraid of
Sol    Re        Mim
Even when the night changes
Do             Re              Sol
It will never change me and you


Sol
Chasing her tonight, doubts are running ‘round her head
Mim
He’s waiting, hides behind his cigarette
Sim                                             Re
Heart is beating loud, she doesn't want it to stop
Sol
Moving too fast, moon is lighting up her skin
Mim
She’s falling, doesn't even know it yet

It will never change me and you

Do#m                                               Mi
Reminds her of a missing piece of innocence she lost

Re             Mi
It will never change, baby

We will never change, baby
