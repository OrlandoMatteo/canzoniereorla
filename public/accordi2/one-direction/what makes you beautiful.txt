            Do     Fa
You're insecure
                 Sol
Don't know what for
                Do              Fa                 Sol
You're turning heads when you walk through the door

Sol                Do  Fa
 Don't need make up
Fa         Sol
 To cover up
Sol           Do            Fa       Sol
 Being the way that you are is enough


Do        Fa            Lam       Sol
Everyone else in the room can see it
Do        Fa         Sol (single strum)
Everyone else but you


          Do           Fa            Sol
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
              Do             Fa            Sol
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
               Do             Fa             Lam      Sol
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
            Do    Fa
You don't know (oh oh)
Lam                      Sol
You don't know you're beautiful
Do        Fa        Sol
If only you saw what I can see
              Do          Fa           Sol
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
               Do          Fa         Lam      Sol
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
           Do     Fa
You don't know (oh oh)
Lam                      Sol
You don't know you're beautiful

So c-come on
             Sol
You got it wrong
              Do          Fa        Sol
To prove I'm right I put it in a song
              Do     Fa
I don't know why
              Sol
You're being shy
            Do         Fa             Sol
And turn away when I look into your ah-ah-eyes


Do        Fa            Lam       Sol
Everyone else in the room can see it
Do        Fa         Sol (single strum)
