Sol
  I figured it out
Sol                       Re/Fa#         Mim
  I figured it out from black and white
Mim
  Seconds and hours
Do
  Maybe they had to take some time
Sol
  I know how it goes
Sol                         Re/Fa#         Mim
  I know how it goes from wrong and right
Mim
  Silence and sound
Do                               Mim    Re/Fa# Do    
  Did they ever hold each other tight like us?
        Do        Mim   Re/Fa# Do
  Did they ever fight like us?


Fa   Sol   Lam
You and I
Do                        Fa
We don't wanna be like them
Mim                        Fa
We can make it till the end
Sol
Nothing can come between 
Fa   Sol   Lam
You and I 
Do                    Fa      Mim                   Fa

    Sol
No nothing can come between
Fa   Sol   Lam      Do    Fa 
You and I
    Fa   Sol   Lam  Do    Fa
Oh, You and I


Sol       
  I figured it out
Sol                    Re/Fa#      Mim
  Saw the mistakes of up and down
Mim
  Meet in the middle
Do
  There's always room for common ground
Sol
  I see what it's like
Sol                           Re/Fa#     Mim
  I see what it's like for day and night
Mim
  Never together
Do                                      Mim    Re/Fa# Do
 'Cause they see things in a different light like us
       Do          Mim   Re/Fa# Do            
  But they never tried like us

We don't wanna be like them

We can make it till the end

Nothing can come between 
Fa   Sol   Lam
