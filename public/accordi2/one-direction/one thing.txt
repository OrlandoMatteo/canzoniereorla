[<pre>Do   Sol   Do

 Do          Sol         Do
I've tried playing it cool
 Do           Sol          Lam
But when I'm looking at you
Lam      Sol        Do
I can't ever be brave
 Do                  Sol     Do
'Cause you make my heart race


Do        Sol         Do
Shot me out of the sky
Do         Sol      Lam
You're my kryptonite
Lam          Sol         Do
You keep me making me weak
Do                Sol     Do
Yeah, frozen and can't breathe


Fa                       Do
Something's gotta give now
           Lam                      Sol
'Cause I'm dying just to make you see
       Fa                       Do
That I need you here with me now
       Fa              Sol    Do
'Cause you've got that one thing


    Do                     Sol        Lam
So get out, get out, get out of my head
     Lam               Sol   Do
And fall into my arms instead
Do                        Sol           Lam
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
    Lam          Sol     Do
But I need that one thing
     Lam             Sol   Do
And you've got that one thing

Do   Sol   Do


Do        Sol            Do
Now I'm climbing the walls
    Do         Sol         Lam
But you don't notice at all
Lam       Sol               Do
That I'm going out of my mind
Do           Sol   Do
All day and all night


Fa                       Do
Something's gotta give now
           Lam                      Sol
'Cause I'm dying just to make you see
       Fa                       Do
That I need you here with me now
       Fa              Sol    Do
'Cause you've got that one thing


    Do                     Sol        Lam
So get out, get out, get out of my head
     Lam               Sol   Do
And fall into my arms instead
Do                        Sol           Lam
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
    Lam          Sol     Do
But I need that one thing


   Do                     Sol         Lam
So get out, get out, get out of my mind
     Lam                Sol  Do
And come on, come into my life
Do                      Sol           Lam
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
Lam              Sol    Do
But I need that one thing
     Do              Sol    Do
And you've got that one thing

Do   Sol   x3


Do               Sol    Do
You've got that one thing
Do                      Sol        Lam
Get out, get out, get out of my head
Lam                    Sol   Do
And fall into my arms instead

    Do                     Sol        Lam
So get out, get out, get out of my head
     Lam               Sol   Do
And fall into my arms instead
Do                        Sol           Lam
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
    Lam          Sol     Do
But I need that one thing


   Do                     Sol         Lam
So get out, get out, get out of my mind
     Lam                Sol   Do
And come on, come into my life
Do                       Sol           Lam
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
Lam              Sol    Do
But I need that one thing
     Do              Sol   Do
And you've got that one thing</pre>]
