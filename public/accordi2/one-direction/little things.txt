[<pre>Sol Do Mim Re Do Re Sol


      Sol
Your hand fits in mine
           Sol
Like it's made just for me
     Do
But bear this in mind
      Do
It was meant to be
        Mim
And I'm joining up the dots
           Re
With the freckles on your cheeks
       Do          Re        Sol
And it all makes sense to me
    Sol
I know you've never loved
      Sol
The crinkles by your eyes
           Do
When you smile,
You've never loved
       Do
Your stomach or your thighs
     Mim
The dimples in your back
        Re
At the bottom of your spine
          Do         Re      Sol
But I'll love them endlessly


Lam                          Do
 I won't let these little things
      Mim             Re
 Slip out of my mouth
          Lam
 But if I do
       Do
 It's you
          Mim 
 Oh it's you
             Re
 They add up to 
         Do
 I'm in love with you
                        Sol
 And all these little things


Sol
You canâ€™t go to bed
    Sol
Without a cup of tea
     Do
And maybe that's the reason
           Do
That you talk in your sleep
     Mim
And all those conversations
         Re
Are the secrets that I keep
           Do        Re        Sol
Though it makes no sense to me
   Sol
I know you've never loved 
      Sol
The sound of your voice on 
   Do                    
Tape, you never want to 
 Do
Know how much you weigh  
Mim
You still have to squeeze
   Re
Into your jeans
     Do         Re       Sol
But you're perfect to me


Lam                          Do
 I won't let these little things
       Mim        Re
 Slip out of my mouth
              Lam
 But if it's true
       Do
 It's you
          Mim 
 Oh it's you
              Re
 They add up to 
         Do
 I'm in love with you
 And all these little things


Lam             Do
 You'll never love yourself
         Mim              Re
 Half as much as I love you
Lam              Do                   Sol
 You'll never treat yourself right darlin'
        Re
 But I want you to
Lam             Do
 If I let you kno-o-o-w
      Sol        Re
 I'm here for you
Lam             Do                 Mim      Re
 Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you. Oh..
Lam                               Do
 And I've just let these little things
      Mim         Re
 Slip out of my mouth
              Lam
 'cause it's you
          Do
 Oh it's you
      Mim
 It's you
             Re
 They add up to
             Do
 And I'm in love with you
 And all these little things


Lam                          Do
 I won't let these little things
      Mim          Re
 Slip out of my mouth
              Lam
 But if it's true
       Do
 It's you
      Mim
 it's you
             Re
 They add up to 
         Do
 I'm in love with you
                       Sol
 And all your little things.</pre>]
