You've gotta help me, I'm losing my mind,
Rem                                    Dom7
keep getting the feeling you want to leave this all behind.

No, they don't teach you this in school,
Rem                              Dom7               Fa
now my heart's breaking and I don't know what to do.

we could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen.

All of the rumours, all of the fights,
Rem                           Dom7          
but we always find a way to make it out alive.
