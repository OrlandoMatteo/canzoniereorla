I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days

It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone


            Sol     La    Sim
And I'll be gone gone tonight
                      Sol      La      Sim
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
                      Sol      La      Sim
The way that I been holdin' on too tight
                   La
With nothing in between
