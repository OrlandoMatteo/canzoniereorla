  It's late in the evening, she's wondering what clothes to wear.
Sol                 Re/Fa#    Do                Re
  She puts on her make-up, and brushes her long blond hair.
Do               Re     Sol      Re/Fa#     Mim
  And then she asks me "Do I look all right?"
            Do             Re            Sol
And I say "Yes, you look wonderful tonight!"


Sol            Re/Fa#  Do              Re
  We'd go to party, and everyone turns to see
Sol                Re/Fa# Do                 Re
  This beautiful lady, that's walking around with me.
Do              Re       Sol        Re/Fa#          Mim
  And then she asks me: "Do you feel all right?"
             Do           Re           Sol
And I say: "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight!"



        Do           Re               Sol        Re/Fa#      Mim
I feel wonderful because I see the love light in your eyes,
         Do            Re               Do             Re
And the wonder of it all is that you just don't realize,
            Sol
How much I love you!


Sol                 Re/Fa#     Do                Re
  It's time to go home now, and I've got an aching head
Sol                   Re/Fa#     Do         Re
  So I give her the carkeys, and she helps me to bed.
Do             Re       Sol     Re/Fa#          Mim
  And then I tell her, as I turn off the light:
            Do                Re           Sol      Re/Fa#     Mim
I say: "My darling, you are wonderful tonight!
  Re/Fa#          Mim       Do                  Re         Sol
                   Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight."</pre>]
