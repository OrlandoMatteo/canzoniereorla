[<pre>Do Sol Fa Fa


      Do
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
       Sol                                 Fa
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey, hey, hey, hey
     Do
She acts like summer and walks like rain
   Sol                                          Fa
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey, hey, hey
  Do
Since the return from her stay on the moon
      Sol                                                Fa
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey


Sol                                 Re
Tell me did you sail across the sun
                               Fa
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
Do
  And that heaven is overrated
Sol                                       Re
Tell me, did you fall from a shooting star
                          Rem
One without a permanent scar
                                   Fa
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there


Do Sol Fa Fa


      Do
Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Sol                                           Fa
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, hey, hey
      Do
She checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo
   Sol                                      Fa
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey, hey, hey
      Do
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
       Sol                                   Fa
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane

Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land


Sol                                       Re
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
                                  Fa
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
Do
  And head back to the Milky Way
    Sol                            Re
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
                                Rem
Was it everything you wanted to find
                                   Fa
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there


Do Sol Fa Fa


                   Do
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
     Sol                           Fa
Your best friend always sticking up for you, even when I know you're wrong
                   Do                                 Sol
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation
    La#                                   Fa
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me


Sol                                       Re
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
                                  Fa
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
Do
  And head back toward the Milky Way
Sol                               Re
Tell me did you sail across the sun
                             Fa
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
Do
  And that heaven is overrated
Sol                                     Re
Tell me, did you fall from a shooting star
                        Rem
One without a permanent scar
                                   Fa
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself

Do
Na na na na na na
Sol
Na na na na na na
            Fa
            (na-na-na-na)
And did you fall from a shooting star, fall from a shooting star
Do
Na na na na na na
