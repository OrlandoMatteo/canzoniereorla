 Welcome to the room of people

 Who have rooms of people that they loved one day, docked away
Lam
 Just because we check the guns at the door
                  Mim
 Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades

 We don't deal with outsiders very well
Mim
 They say newcomers have a certain smell

 You have trust issues, not to mention
