Fa                           Rem
 I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard 
Lam
 I wish I had a better voice and sang some better words
Fa                           Rem
 I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
Lam
 I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
Fa                      Rem
 I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
Lam
 But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think


            Fa              Rem               Lam
 My name's Blurryface, and I care what you think
            Fa              Rem               Lam
 My name's Blurryface, and I care what you think


Fa               Mim            Lam      Mim
 Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
Lam         Sol          Do                 Mi
 When our mommas sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
Lam              Sol             Do       Mi
 Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
Lam         Sol          Do                 Mi  N.C.               Fa Rem
 When our mommas sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
Lam              Fa  Rem Lam Lam
 We're stressed out


Fa                               Rem
 Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
Lam
 How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from
Fa                             Rem
 I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Lam
 Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only ever sell one
Fa                            Rem
 I'd give it to my brother because we have the same nose
Lam
 Same clothes, home grown, the stones thrown from the creek we used to roam
Fa                            Rem
 But it would remind of when nothing really mattered
Lam
 Out of student loans and tree house homes, we all would take the latter

 My name's Blurryface, and I care what you think
            Fa              Rem               Lam
 My name's Blurryface, and I care what you think

    Lam                              Sol
 We used to play pretend, give each other different names
          Do                                 Mi
 We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
         Lam                                   Sol
 Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face saying 
  Do                        Mi
 "Wake up you need to make money"

 We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
Lam
 We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
