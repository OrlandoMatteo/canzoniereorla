Remaj7
You don't know babe
Lam7
When you hold me
Solmaj7
And kiss me slowly
         La#maj7
It's the sweetest thing
Remaj7
And it don't change
Lam7
If I had it my way
Solmaj7                   La#maj7
You would know that you are


Remaj7
You're the coffee that I need in the morning
Lam7
You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring
Solmaj7
Won't you give yourself to me
        La#maj7
Give it all, oh


             Remaj7
I just wanna see
               Lam7
I just wanna see how beautiful you are
Solmaj7             La#maj7
You know that I see it
                 Remaj7
I know you're a star
               Lam7
Where you go I follow

No matter how far
Solmaj7         La#maj7
If life is a movie
                      Remaj7 Lam7
Oh you're the best part, oh
                Solmaj7    La#maj7
You're the best part, oh
Best part


Remaj7
It's the sunrise
Lam7
And those brown eyes
Solmaj7                   La#maj7
You're the one that I desire
Remaj7
When we wake up
Lam7
And then we make love
Solmaj7               La#maj7
It makes me feel so nice


Remaj7
You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert
Lam7
You're the Tylenol I take when my head hurts
Solmaj7                     La#maj7
You're the sunshine on my life


Remaj7           Lam7
I just wanna see how beautiful you are
Solmaj7            La#maj7
You know that I see it
                 Remaj7
I know you're a star
               Lam7
Where you go I follow

No matter how far
Solmaj7         La#maj7
If life is a movie
                      Remaj7 Lam7
Oh you're the best part, oh
                Solmaj7    La#maj7
You're the best part, oh
Best part
