[<pre>Fa
It's not simple to say
          Do
That most days, I don't recognize me
           Rem
That these shoes and this apron

That place and its patrons
     La#
Have taken more than I gave them
Fa
It's not easy to know
        Do
I'm not anything that I used to be although
          Rem
It's true, I was never attention's sweet center
  La#
I still remember that girl


Fa
She's imperfect but she tries
       Do
She is good but she lies
      Rem
She is hard on herself
      La#
She is broken and won't ask for help
       Fa
She is messy but she's kind
       Do
She is lonely most of the time
       Rem
She is all of this mixed up and
                     La#
baked in a beautiful pie
                               Fa
She is gone but she used to be mine


Fa
And it's not what I asked for
         Do
Sometimes life just slips in through a backdoor
    Rem                                                La#
and carves out a person and makes you believe it's all true

And now I've got you
Fa
And you're not what I asked for
       La7/Do#
If I'm honest I know I would give it all back
      Rem
for a chance to start over
                     La#
And rewrite an ending or two

for the girl that I knew


         Fa
Who'd be reckless just enough
          Do
Who'd get hurt but who learns how to toughen up
           Rem
When she's bruised and gets used
                   La#
By a man who can't love

And then she'll get stuck
       Fa
And be scared of the life that's inside her
    La7/Do#
Growing stronger each day

'Til it finally reminds her
   Rem
To fight just a little
                               La#
To bring back the fire in her eyes
                                Fa     La7/Do#
That's been gone but used to be mine
           Rem     La#
Used to be mine


    Fa
She is messy but she's kind
       Do
She is lonely most of the time
       Rem
She is all of this mixed up
               Rem/Do      La#
and baked in a beautiful pie
                               Fa
She is gone but she used to be mine</pre>]
