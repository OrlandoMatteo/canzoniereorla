           Sol#
    Do you know how to realise?
                   Re#/Sol
    I'm willing to give it all that I got
            Fam9      Do#add9
    just to know I will make it out with you
          Sol#
    Maybe just one minute more
               Re#/Sol
    could have saved what you are crying for
            Fam9           Do#add9
    but I'm gone... and it's not because of you
    La#m7
    you don't have to worry about the things you could have done that night
  Dom7
    it was my moment not just something that I could decide
  Do#                                                Re#4  Re#
    It didn't happen just because you didn't stop my ride

    Sol#                        Re#/Sol                 Fam7
    No, you know that I'm not cool like you, I'm not true like you
                          Do#add9
    I'm trying to figure out your mood!
    Sol#                        Re#/Sol                Fam7
    No, you know that I'm not cool like you, I'm not true like you
                        Do#add9      Sol#  Fa#6  Fam7  Do#add9
    It's not our world me minus you!

              Sol#
    Are those moments still inside (you)?
               Re#/Sol
    Don't be afraid of my whispers at night
               Fam9
    Don't you know?
              Do#add9
    That I'm still here next to you!
             Sol#
    Grab our dream of being one
                       Re#/Sol
    Cause I'm feeling lonely lonely!
                 Fam9        Do#add9
    You've gotta know that I'm still here next to you!
    La#m7

    so wipe your eyes!
        Fam9                         Do#            Re#
    You know you're not alone, don't make me feel alone!

    Wipe your eyes!
