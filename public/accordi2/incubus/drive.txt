Mim     Mim7   Domaj7     La7      Mim              Mim7    Domaj7    La7
Sometimes, I feel the fear of un---certainty stinging clear
Mim    Mim7   Domaj7                   La7
And I can't help but ask myself how much
       Mim                    Mim7     Domaj7    La7
I'll let the fear take the wheel and steer.


Domaj7           La7                              Domaj9   La7
It's driven me before, and it seems to have a vague   haunting mass appeal.
Domaj7          La7                        Domaj9             La7
But lately I'm beginning to find that I  should be the one behind the wheel.


Mim       Mim7  Domaj7         La7     Mim
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
  Mim7     Domaj7                La7
with open arms and open eyes, Yeah
  Mim     Mim7  Domaj7          La7               Mim   Mim7   Domaj7  La7
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there..I'll be there.


Mim     Mim7    Domaj7           La7        Mim          Mim7  Domaj7  La7
So, if I de---cide to waiver my chance to be one of the hive
Mim    Mim7     Domaj7           La7      Mim            Mim7   Domaj7  La7
Will I choose water over wine and hold my own and drive? Ahaa-aa-aa-aa.


Domaj7            La7                            Domaj9       La7
It's driven me before and it seems to be the way that everyone else gets around.
Domaj7      La7                             Domaj9       La7
But lately I'm beginning to find that when I drive myself my light is found.


Mim       Mim7  Domaj7         La7     Mim
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
  Mim7     Domaj7                La7
with open arms and open eyes, Yeah
  Mim     Mim7  Domaj7          La7           Mim   Mim7   Domaj7  La7
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there    I'll be there.

Would you choose water over wine  hold the wheel and drive?


Mim       Mim7  Domaj7         La7     Mim
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
