       Mim  Sol  Re  Do

           Mim       Sol        Re  Do
Will those feet in modern times
        Mim            Sol           Re  Do
Walk on soles that are made in China?
            Mim        Sol       Re  Do
Through the bright prosaic malls
         Mim               Sol          Re  Do
And the corridors that go on and on and on
       Mim            Sol
Are we blind - can we see?
       Re        Do
We are one, incomplete
       Mim            Sol
Are we blind - in the city?
            Re              Do
Waiting for lightning to be saved, yeah

              Mim            Sol
Cause love is noise, love is pain
              Re                      Do
Love is these blues that I'm singing again
        Mim            Sol
Love is noise, love is pain
              Re
Love is these blues that
             Do             Mim          Sol
I'm singing again, again, again, again, again

      Mim       Sol               Re  Do
Understand this world's affliction?
     Mim       Sol           Re  Do
Recognise the righteous anger?
     Mim        Sol             Re  Do
Understand this world's addiction?
      Mim              Sol
I was blind - couldn't see
         Re      Do
What was here in me
      Mim         Sol
I was blind - insecure
              Re               Do
Felt like the road was way too long, yeah

              Mim            Sol

All those feet in modern times
 Re                   Do
Walk on soles made in China

Will those feet in modern times

See the bright prosaic malls
            Mim     Sol
Will those feet in modern times
     Re             Do
Recognise the heavy burden...
