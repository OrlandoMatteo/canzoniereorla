       Si

          Si
There you were on the floor cut up

And all alone I'll help you

Conceived in a chrome dream I was a crease

In the shirt that this world wears

Till I met Blue, I was in obscurity he said

Loosen up who do you wanna be?

We could steal a car and listen to the stars

I can see you've choked on them too

Had enough of late night films

Just enough for an hour or two

Oh Blue show me something new

Oh Blue show me something new

Lamaj7             Fa#m7                 Si
Blue, I've got a question every time I hold you
       Lamaj7            Fa#m7
Yeah, Blue, I've got a question every time
   Si
I swallow you it's true

Si
Spike danced for 10 days long

We were just heading for the sun

You shot him down there's blood on my face

His heart's in the right place

What they gonna do to you
                Lamaj7
What they gonna do
           Fa#m7              Si
Blue don't forget the word I warned you
   Lamaj7                Fa#m7                      Si
Oh Blue don't let them push you don't let them destroy you
    Lamaj7      Fa#m7                         Si
Meanwhile I'm searching with my brain blown eyes
        Lamaj7             Fa#m7                 Si
See the world through my dirty lonely mixed up mind
