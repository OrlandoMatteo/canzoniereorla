       Do  Mim  Lam  Faadd9

       Do  Mim  Lam  Fa

Do
my friend and me,
Mim
looking thru her
     Lam     Faadd9
red box of memories
Do
Faded, I'm sure,
    Mim
but love seems to
       Lam    Faadd9
stick in her things you know

Fa                       Sol
yes, there's love if you want it,
     Mim       Faadd9
don't sound like a sonnet, my love
                         Sol
yes, there's love if you want it,
     Mim        Fa
don't sound like a sonnet, my love
Sol Fa
my  love

Do  Mim  Lam  Faadd9

Do
why can't you see
     Mim
that nature has it's way
   Lam        Faadd9
of warning me?
Do
eyes open wide,
Mim
looking at the heavens
       Lam       Faadd9
with a tear in my eye

Fa                       Sol
yes, there's love if you want it,
     Mim       Fa
don't sound like a sonnet, my love
                         Sol
yes, there's love if you want it,
     Mim       Fa
don't sound like a sonnet, my love
Sol Fa
my  love
Sol
Sinking faster than a boat
   Fa
without a hull my love
Sol
dreaming about the day
     Fa               Sol
when i can see you here by my side...

Fa         Sol    Fa
  ...by my side

Fa       Sol
 Here we go again
    Mim
and my head it is gone
   Fa
my love
  Sol
I stop to say hello
      Mim
because I think you should know
Sol Fa   Sol Fa
by  now, by  now
Sol Fa   Sol Fa
by  now, by  now
Sol Fa   Sol Fa
by  now, by  now
Sol Fa   Sol Fa
by  now, by  now
Sol Fa   Sol Fa
by  now, by  now...
