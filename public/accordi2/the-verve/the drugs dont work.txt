        Do   Lam   Mim  Fa  Sol  Do

         Do
All this talk of gettin' old
     Mim/Si     Lam
it's gettin' me down my love
                Mim
like a cat in a bag
           Fa
waiting to drown
Sol            Do          Sol Do
this time I'm coming down

And I hope you're thinking of me
                 Lam
As you lay down on your side
                     Mim
Now the drugs don't work
                    Fa
They just make you worse
      Sol                Do         Sol Do
But I know I'll see your face again
                    Mim
Now the drugs don't work
                   Fa
They just make you worse
      Sol                Do         Sol Do
But I know I'll see your face again

               Do
But I know I'm on a losing streak
                   Lam
'as I passed down by your street
                 Mim                     Fa
And if you wanna show, then just let me know
         Sol          Do         Sol Do
And I'll sing in your ear again
                    Mim
Now the drugs don't work
                   Fa
They just make you worse
       Sol                Do
But I know I'll see your face again
