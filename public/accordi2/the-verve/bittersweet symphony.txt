            Mi    Sim7  La4   La
Cos' it's a bittersweet symphony
       Mi  Sim7  La4  La
that's life..
          Mi        Sim7          La4          La
Trying to make ends meet you're a slave to the money
         Mi   Sim7  La4   La
then you die.
              Mi       Sim7  La4       La
I'll take you down the only  road I've ever
Mi        Sim7  La4  La
been down
             Mi       Sim7             La4          La
You know the one that takes you to the places where all the
      Mi    Sim7  La4   La
veins meet yeah

Mi               Sim7          La4           La
No change, I can change, I can change, I can change
        Mi         Sim7        La4        La
But I'm here in my mould, I am here in my mould.
          Mi                Sim7        La4            La
But I'm a million different people from one day to the next
               Mi         Sim7    La4     La
I can't change   my mould no  no  no  no  no  no
Mi  Sim7  La4  La  Mi  Sim7  La4  La

          Mi    Sim7         La4       La
Well I've never prayed but tonight I'm on
   Mi         Sim7  La4  La
my knees yeah..
          Mi        Sim7        La4           La
I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain
   Mi   Sim7  La4  La
in me yeah
          Mi     Sim7         La4        La
I let the melody shine let it cleanse my mind
       Mi    Sim7  La4  La
I feel free now
        Mi           Sim7              La4    La
but the airwaves are clean and there's nobody singing
   Mi    Sim7  La4  La
to me now

Mi               Sim7          La4           La
No change, I can change, I can change, I can change
        Mi         Sim7        La4        La
But I'm here in my mould, I am here in my mould.
          Mi                Sim7        La4            La
AND I'm a million different people from one day to the next
               Mi         Sim7    La4     La
I can't change   my mould no  no  no  no  no  no
              Mi         Sim7  La4  La  Mi  Sim7  La4  La
