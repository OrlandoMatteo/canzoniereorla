Sim                    Re            Mim               Sol   Fa#
     You know I'm not one to break promises
Sim                    Re                      Mim         Sol    Fa#     
      I don't want to hurt you but I need to breathe
Sim                     Re                   Mim               Sol    Fa#     
     At the end of it all, you're still my best friend
Sim                         Re                     Mim        Sol    Fa#     
     But there's something inside that I need to release
Sim                         Re
Which way is right, which way is wrong
Mim                  Sol        Fa#
How do I say that I need to move on
Sim                  Re                Mim     Sol    Fa#
     You know we're heading separate ways


       Sim              Re                 Mim          Sol    Fa#
And it feels like I am just too close to love you
Sim                       Re            Mim     Sol      Fa#
     There ain't nothing I can really say
Sim                        Re               Mim
     I can't lie no more, I can't hide no more
                    Sol      Fa#
Got to be true to myself
       Sim              Re                 Mim
And it feels like I am just too close to love you

     You've given me more than I can return
Sim                   Re                Mim        Sol     Fa#
     Yet there oh so much that you deserve
Sim              Re                      
Nothing to say, nothing to do,
Mim
Nothing to give
       Sol         Fa#
I must leave without you
Sim                  Re                Mim      Sol    Fa#
