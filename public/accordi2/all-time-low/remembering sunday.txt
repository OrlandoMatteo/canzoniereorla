[<pre>Domaj7  Mim  Doadd9  La7


Domaj7                                     Mim
   He woke up from dreaming and put on his shoes
                             Doadd9
   Started making his way past two in the morning
                             La7
   He hasn't been sober for days
Domaj7
   Leaning now into the breeze
 Resus2
   Remembering Sunday he falls to his knees
           Mim
   They had breakfast together
            Mim
   But two eggs don't last
            La7
   Like the feeling of what he needs
Domaj7
   Now this place seems familiar to him
 Resus2
   She pulled on his hand with a devilish grin
      Mim
   She led him upstairs, she led him upstairs
           La7
   Left him dying to get in


  Sol                       Doadd9
   Forgive me I'm trying to find
                          La7
   My calling, I'm calling at night
                  
   I don't mean to be a bother
      Doadd9
   But have you seen this girl?
  Sol                             Doadd9
   She's been running through my dreams
                               La7
   And it's driving me crazy it seems
                             Doadd9
   I'm gonna ask her to marry me


Domaj7                                Resus2
  Even though she doesn't believe in love
                             Mim
  He's determined to call her bluff
                               La7
  Who could deny, these butterflies?
           
  They're filling his gut
Domaj7                  Resus2
  Waking the neighbors, unfamiliar faces
    Mim
  He pleads though he tries
    Mim
  But he's only denied
           La7
  Now he's dying to get inside


Sol                       Doadd9
   Forgive me I'm trying to find
                          La7
   My calling, I'm calling at night
           La7
   I don't mean to be a bother
      Doadd9
   But have you seen this girl?
  Sol                             Doadd9
   She's been running through my dreams
                               La7
   And it's driving me crazy it seems
                             Doadd9
   I'm gonna ask her to marry me


 Mim                           Doadd9
  The neighbors said she moved away
                          Sol
  Funny how it rained all day
                Sol
  I didn't think much of it then
             Re
  But it's starting to all make sense
 Re         Mim                  Doadd9
  Oh I can see now that all of these clouds
     Sol
  Are following me in my desperate endeavor
    Re                                Sol
  To find my whoever, whoever she may be


      Sol                                      Doadd9
  I'm not coming back, I've done something so terrible
                                                    La7
  I'm terrified to speak, but you'd expect that from me
                     La7
  I'm mixed up, I'll be blunt, now the rain is just
Doadd9                                     Sol
  Washing you out of my hair and out of my mind
                Sol
  Keeping an eye on the world
Doadd9
  So many thousands of feet off the ground
      La7
  I'm over you now, I'm at home in the clouds
Doadd9
  Towering over your head


                 Mim
  I guess I'll go home now
                 Resus2
  I guess I'll go home now
                 Mim
  I guess I'll go home now
                 La7
  I guess I'll go home.</pre>]
