As the snow flies
     Rem
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
  Re#              Fa
A poor little baby child is born
       La#    Re#/La# La#   Re#/La# La#
In the ghetto
                    Re#/La# La#  Re#/La# La#
And his mama cries
          Rem
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
      Re#           Fa
It's another hungry mouth to feed
       La#      Re#/La# La#  Re#/La# La#
In the ghetto

                  Fa
People, don't you understand
                  Re#     La#
The child needs a helping hand
   Re#                 Fa                   La#
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
               Fa
Take a look at you and me,
           Re#      La#
Are we too blind to see?
Re#          Rem                Dom7           Fa
Do we simply turn our heads and look the other way?

          La#      Re#/La# La#  Re#/La# La#
Well, the world turns
      Rem
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Re#                        Fa
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
       La#    Re#/La# La#   Re#/La# La#
In the ghetto

And his hunger burns
      Rem
So he starts to roam the streets at night
       Re#                         Fa
And he learns how to steal, and he learns how to fight
       La#    Re#/La# La#   Re#/La# La#
In the ghetto

Fa
Then one night in desperation
    Re#               La#
The young man breaks away
   Re#         Rem
He buys a gun, Steals a car,
Dom7                 Fa
Tries to run, But he don't get far
        La#      Re#/La# La#   Re#/La# La#
And his mama cries

     Rem
As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
     Re#                       Fa
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
       La#    Re#/La# La#   Re#/La# La#
In the ghetto

And as her young man dies,
     Rem
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin',
 Re#                Fa
Another little baby child is born
       La#    Re#/La# La#   Re#/La# La#
In the ghetto
        La#        Re#/La# La#   Re#/La# La#
And his mama cries
