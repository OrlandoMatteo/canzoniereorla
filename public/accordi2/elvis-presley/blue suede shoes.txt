Well, it's one for the money,

Two for the show,

Three to get ready,

Now go, cat, go
    Re7                             La
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
        Mi7                 Re7                  La
You can do anything but lay off of my Blue suede shoes

              La
Well, you can knock me down,

Step in my face,

Slander my name

All over the place

Do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh,

Honey, lay off of my shoes

You can burn my house,

Steal my car,

Drink my liquor

From an old fruitjar

Do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh,

Honey, lay off of my shoes
