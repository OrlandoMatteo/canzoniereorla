[<pre>Sol                        Do
We're caught in a trap;  I can't walk out
Re               Do               Sol
because I love you too much,  baby.
Sol                    Do
Why can't you see,   what you're doing to me,
Re                      Do          Re     Do  Sim  Re7
when you don't believe a word I say?



Do                Sol        Sim                  Do    Re
 We can't go on together, with Suspicious Minds;
Mim                  Sim          Do              Re       Re7
 and we can't build our dreams, on Suspicious Minds.



Sol                              Do
So, if an old friend I know, drops by to say hello,
Re                 Do           Sol
would I still see suspicion in your eyes?
Sol                  Do
Here we go again, asking where I've been.
Re                       Do               Re      Do  Sim  Re7
You can see these tears are real I'm crying.



Do                Sol        Sim                  Do      Re7
 We can't go on together, with Suspicious Minds;
Mim                  Sim           Do              Si7sus4   Si7
 and we can't build our dreams, on Suspicious Minds...

   Mim             Sim            Do
      Oh, let our love survive,
                   Re
      I'll dry the tears from your eyes.
   Mim                   Sim             Do
      Let's don't let a good thing die,  when honey,
         Re                Sol               Do    Sol       Re7
      you know I've never,  lied to you;   Mmm,  yeah,  yeah!

Don't you know...
