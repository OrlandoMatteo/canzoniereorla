Dom
Never know how much I love you

Never know how much I care

When you put your arms around me
        Sol7                     Dom
I get a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever when you kiss me

Fever when you hold me tight

Fever in the morning
Sol7                  Dom
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime

Moon lights up the night

I light up when you call my name
        Sol7                     Dom
And you know I'm gonna treat you right

You give me fever when you kiss me

Fever when you hold me tight

Fever in the morning
Sol7                  Dom
Fever all through the night

Ev'rybody's got the fever

that is something you all know

Fever isn't such a new thing
Sol7                Dom    Sol7 Dom
Fever started long ago

Dom
 Romeo loved Juliet

Juliet she felt the same

When he put his arms around her
         Sol7                   Dom
He said 'Julie, baby, you're my flame

Thou giv-est fever when we kisseth

Fever with thy flaming youth

Fever I'm on fire
Sol7                 Dom
Fever yea I burn for sooth'

Captain Smith and Pocahantas

Had a very mad affair

When her daddy tried to kill him
          Sol7                Dom
She said 'Daddy, o, don't you dare

He gives me fever with his kisses

Fever when he holds me tight

Fever, I'm his misses,
   Sol7                       Dom    Sol7 Dom
Oh daddy, won't you treat him right'

Dom
Now you've listened to my story

Here's the point that I have made

Cats were born to give chicks fever
      Sol7               Dom
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade

Then we give you the fever when we kiss you

Fever if you live and learn

Fever till you sizzle
Sol7                 Dom
What a lovely way to burn
Sol7                 Dom
What a lovely way to burn
Sol7                 Dom
What a lovely way to burn...
