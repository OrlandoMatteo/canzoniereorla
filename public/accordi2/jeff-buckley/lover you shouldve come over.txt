        Re    Doadd9 Mim

Re
Looking out the door
                             Doadd9  Mim
I see the rain fall upon the funeral  mourners
  Re
Parading in a wake of sad relations
                    Doadd9  Mim
As their shoes fill up with water
Do#m7b5                  Fa#5  Fa#5/Mi
        And maybe I'm too young
   Sim            Re/La      Sol
To keep good love from going wrong
      Re                    Doadd9 Mim
But tonight, you're on my mind  so

You'll never know

    Re
I'm broken down and angry for your love
        Doadd9 Mim
With no way to feed it
  Re
Where are you tonight?
                   Doadd9 Mim
Child you know how much  I need it
Do#m7b5                Fa#5   Fa#5/Mi
      Too young to hold on
        Sim          Re/La          Sol  Fa#
And too hold to just break free and run

Sim                     Mim7
   Sometimes a man gets carried away,
        Sim                                Mim7
When he feels like he should be having his fun
             Sim                          Mim7
And much too blind to see the damage he's done
Doadd9
Sometimes a man must awake to find that, really,
       Mim          Fadim
He has    no-one...
Re/Fa#                   Solm6
    So I'll wait for you...And I'll burn
Fa#m11                              Sol6/Si
      Oh will I ever see your sweet return?
Laadd9/Do#
      Oh, will I ever learn?
  Do7+/Mi    Re6     Laadd9/Do#
      Oh,    oh, oh, lover,
 Laadd9           Fa#m11 Mim Mim9 Mim7
    you should've come    over
                    Re/La       Doadd9  Mim
'Cause it's not too late

Re
Lonely is the room, the bed is made
                Doadd9   Mim
The open window lets the rain in
Re
Burning in the corner is the only one
              Doadd9 Mim
who dreams he had you  with him
Do#m7b5           Fa#5 Fa#5/Mi    Sim    Re/La
       My body turns and yearns for a sleep
                Sol
That won't ever come
Sol#m7b5  Re/La
It's never over,
                 Re   Doadd9   Mim      Mim9 Mim7 Mim
My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
           Re/La
It's never over, all my riches for her smiles
       Re       Doadd9 Mim       Mim9  Mim7
When I slept so soft  against her...
Mim        Re/La
It's never over,
                     Re        Doadd9 Mim      Mim9 Mim7
All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
Mim        Re/La
It's never over, she's the tear
             Re      Doadd9 Mim   Mim9 Mim7
That hangs inside my soul forever
La9              Fa#5   Fa#5/Mi
      Maybe I'm just too young

I'm much too hold to break free and run
    Laadd9/Do#
Too deef, dumb and blind
                  Do7+/Mi   Re6
To see the damage I've done
Laadd9/Do# Laadd9/Si Laadd9 Fa#m11  Mim Mim9 Mim7
