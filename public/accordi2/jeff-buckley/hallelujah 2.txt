  Do                 Lam
I heard there was a secret chord
     Do                   Lam
That David played and it pleased the lord
    Fa                Sol               Do        Sol
But you don't really care for music, do you?
        Do                  Fa           Sol
Well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth
    Lam                 Fa
The minor fall and the major lift
    Sol            Mi7             Lam
The baffled king composing hallelujah


     Fa           Lam          Fa           Do    Sol   Do      Lam Do Lam
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah ....


          Do                        Lam
Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
    Do               Lam
You saw her bathing on the roof
    Fa              Sol             Do            Sol
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
    Do               Fa       Sol
She tied you to her kitchen chair
    Lam                        Fa
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
    Sol                  Mi7            Lam
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah


     Fa           Lam          Fa           Do    Sol   Do      Lam Do Lam
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah ....


Do              Lam
Baby I've been here before
     Do                       Lam
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
  Fa             Sol             Do          Sol
I used to live alone before I knew you
     Do                     Fa      Sol
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
    Lam               Fa     
But love is not a victory march
       Sol               Mi7          Lam
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah


     Fa           Lam          Fa           Do    Sol   Do      Lam Do Lam
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah ....


     Do                         Lam
Well there was a time when you let me know
       Do            Lam
What's really going on below
    Fa             Sol               Do        Sol
But now you never show that to me do you
      Do             Fa        Sol
But remember when I moved in you
        Lam            Fa
And the holy dove was moving too
    Sol               Mi7            Lam
And every breath we drew was hallelujah


     Fa           Lam          Fa           Do    Sol   Do      Lam Do Lam
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah ....


      Do               Lam
Well, maybe there's a god above
    Do             Lam
But all I've ever learned from love
    Fa                Sol           Do          Sol
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
     Do                  Fa       Sol
It's not a cry that you hear at night
     Lam                 Fa
It's not somebody who's seen the light
       Sol               Mi7          Lam
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah


     Fa           Lam          Fa           Do    Sol   Do      
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah ....
     Fa           Lam          Fa           Do    Sol   Do      
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah ....
     Fa           Lam          Fa           Do    Sol   Do      
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah ....</pre>]
