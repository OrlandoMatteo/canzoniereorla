       Solm7

                Fa      Do        Solm 7
It feels like I only go backwards baby,
              Fa       Do    Solm7
Every part of me says “go ahead”
                       Fa       Do  Solm7
But I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
              Fa      Do        Solm7
Feels like we only go backwards darling

Rem7
 I know that you think you sound
                       Domaj7
silly when you call my name

But I hear it inside my head all day
Rem7
 When I realise I’m just holding onto
              Sol7
the hope that maybe
                    Solm7
your feelings don’t show…

                Fa      Do        Solm 7
It feels like I only go backwards baby,
              Fa       Do    Solm7
Every part of me says “go ahead”
                       Fa       Do  Solm7
But I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
              Fa      Do        Solm7
Feels like we only go backwards darling

Rem7                                    Domaj7
 The seed of all this indecision isn’t me, oh no,

‘Cause I decided long ago
    Rem7
But that’s the way it seems to go when trying
                            Sol7
so hard to get to something real,
   Solm7
It feels…

                Fa      Do        Solm 7
It feels like I only go backwards baby,
              Fa       Do    Solm7
Every part of me says “go ahead”
                       Fa       Do  Solm7
But I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
              Fa      Do        Solm7
Feels like we only go backwards darling
                Fa      Do        Solm 7
It feels like I only go backwards baby,
              Fa       Do    Solm7
Every part of me says “go ahead”
                       Fa       Do  Solm7
But I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
              Fa      Do        Solm7
Feels like we only go backwards darling...
