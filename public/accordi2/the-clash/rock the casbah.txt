By order of the prophet,
   Sol               Rem

     Lam                 Mim
De - generate the faithful

But the Bedouin, they brought out the e - lectric camel drum,

Now over at the temple,

....oh, they really pack 'em in,
    Lam
The in crowd say it's cool

As soon as the Sharif was chauffered out of there,
    Sol                     Rem
The jet pilots tuned to the cockpit radio blare,
