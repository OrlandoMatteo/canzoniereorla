       Mim  Famaj7  Mim  Famaj7

Mim                   Famaj7
London calling to the faraway towns
Sol
Now that war is declared-and battle come down
Mim                   Famaj7
London calling to the underworld
     Sol
Come out of the cupboard, all you boys and girls
Mim                 Famaj7
London calling, now don't look at us
         Sol
All that phoney beatlemania has bitten the dust
Mim                    Famaj7
London calling, see we ain't got no swing
 Sol
'cept for the ring of that truncheon thing

    Mim                    Sol
The ice age is coming, the sun is zooming in
Mim                          Sol
Engines stop running and the wheat is growing thin
Mim                  Sol
A nuclear error, but I have no fear
Mim                    Re                 Mim
London is drowning-and I live by the river

                      Famaj7
London calling to the imitation zone
Sol
 Forget it, brother, an' go it alone
Mim                     Famaj7
London calling upon the zombies of death
Sol
Quit holding out-and draw another breath
Mim                  Famaj7
London calling-and I don't wanna shout
    Sol
But when we were talking-i saw you nodding out
Mim                    Famaj7
London calling, see we ain't got no highs
  Sol
Except for that one with the yellowy eyes

    Mim                    Sol
The ice age is coming, the sun is zooming in
Mim                          Sol
Engines stop running and the wheat is growing thin
Mim                  Sol
A nuclear error, but I have no fear
Mim                    Re                 Mim  Famaj7  Sol
London is drowning-and I live by the river

Mim  Famaj7  Sol   Mim  Famaj7  Sol   Mim  Famaj7  Sol

    Mim                    Sol

Mim  Famaj7  Mim  Famaj7  Mim  Famaj7

Mim                  Famaj7
London calling, yes, I was there too
        Mim                        Famaj7
And you know what they said? Well, some of it was true!
Mim                   Famaj7
London calling at the top of the dial
    Mim                       Famaj7
And after all this, won't you give me a smile?
Mim            Famaj7  Mim  Famaj7
London calling...
  Mim
I never felt so much alike alike alike alike...
