Mim                   Re Do
Colours on the street

Red white and blue
       Mim                  Re Do
People shufflin' their feet
       Mim                    Re Do
People sleepin' in their shoes
              Mim                 Re    Do
But there's a warnin' sign on the road ahead
          Mim                          Re         Do
There's a lot of people sayin' we'd be better off dead

I see a girl in the night
       Mim              Re  Do
With a baby in her hand
         Mim               Re  Do
Under an old street light
       Mim          Re  Do
Near a garbage can
        Mim                         Re            Do
Now she puts the kid away and she's gone to get a hit
    Mim                           Re      Do
She hates her life and what she's done to it
       Mim                    Re          Do
That's one more kid that will never go to school

Never get to fall in love never get to be cool
