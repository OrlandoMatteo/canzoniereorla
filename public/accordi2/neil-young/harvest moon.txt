Mim7
 Come a little bit closer
                     Re  La  Re  La
Hear what I have to say
Mim7
 Just like children sleepin'
                           Re   La  Re  La
We could dream this night away
Sol
 But there's a full moon risin'
                         Re   Re6  Remaj7
Let's go dancin' in the light

Re  Re6  Remaj7  Sol


We know where the music's playin'
                          Re   Re6  Remaj7
Let's go out and feel the night

Re  Re6  Remaj7

Mim7/La                          La
 Because I'm still in love with you
                         Mim7/La
I want to see you dance again
                               La
Because I'm still in love with you
                Re    Remaj7
On this harvest moon

When we were strangers
                    Re  La  Re  La
I watched you from afar
Mim7
 When we were lovers
                        Re   La  Re  La
I loved you with all my heart
Sol
 But now it's gettin' late
                          Re  Re6  Remaj7
And the moon is climbin' high

Re  Re6  Remaj7  Sol


I want to celebrate
                        Re  Re6  Remaj7
See it shinin' in your eyes
