Old man look at my life 
Do                       Sol           
Twenty four and there's so much more

Live alone in a paradise
Do                 Fa

Love lost, such a cost,
Do                   Sol              
Give me things that don't get lost.
Re                Do               
Like a coin that won't get tossed
Fa               Sol   
Rollin' home to you.

Lullabies, look in your eyes,
Do                       Sol  
Run around the same old town.

To mean that much to you

I've been first and last
Do                       Sol  
Look at how the time goes past.
Re          Fa   
But I'm all alone at last.

Rolling home to you.
