       Do  Rem  Sol  Sol7

              Do       Rem
Think I'll go out to Alberta
          Sol               Do
Weather's good there in the fall
                                 Rem           Sol  Sol7
I got some friends that I could go to working for
          Do                     Rem
Still, I wish you'd change your mind
      Sol              Do
If I ask you one more time
          Rem                 Fa               Sol   Sol7
But we've been through this a hundred times or more
     Do                     Rem
Four strong winds that blow lonely
      Sol           Do
Seven seas that run high
                            Rem               Sol  Sol7
All those things that don't change, come what may
       Do                 Rem
If the good times are all gone
         Sol              Do
Then I'm bound for moving on
      Rem                Fa              Sol  Sol7
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
     Do                   Rem
If I get there before the snow flies
       Sol                 Do
And if things are looking good
                        Rem               Sol  Sol7
You could meet me if I send you down the fare
       Do               Rem
But by then it would be winter
     Sol                 Do
Not too much for you to do
     Rem                 Fa                Sol   Sol7
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there

     Do                     Rem
Four strong winds that blow lonely
      Sol           Do
Seven seas that run high
                            Rem               Sol  Sol7
All those things that don't change, come what may
    Do                 Rem
The good times are all gone
      Sol                Do
So I'm bound for moving on
      Rem                Fa             Sol  Sol7
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
