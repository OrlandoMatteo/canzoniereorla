Mim            Re    Sol
 I am not the only traveler
Mim             Sol        Do
 Who has not repaid his debt
          Mim              Re  
I've been searching for a trail 
    Sol
to follow again
         Mim         Sol        Do
Take me back to the night we met
         Mim    Sol      Do
And then I can tell myself
         Mim         Sol         Do
What the hell I'm supposed to do
         Mim    Sol      Do
And then I can tell myself
        Mim   Sol         Do
Not to ride along with you


      Mim                         Re    
I had all and then most of you, some and 
        Sol
now none of you
         Mim         Sol        Do
Take me back to the night we met
        Mim                          
I don't know what I'm supposed to do, 
   Re                Sol
haunted by the ghost of you
             Mim         Sol        Do
Oh, take me back to the night we met


          Mim       Sol       Do
When the night was full of terror
          Mim       Sol           Do
And your eyes were filled with tears
          Mim     Sol          Do
When you had not touched me yet
             Mim         Sol        Do
Oh, take me back to the night we met


      Mim                      
I had all and then most of you,
  Re            Sol
some and now none of you
         Mim         Sol        Do
Take me back to the night we met
        Mim                           
I don't know what I'm supposed to do,
  Re             Sol
haunted by the ghost of you
         Mim         Sol        Do
Take me back to the night we met
