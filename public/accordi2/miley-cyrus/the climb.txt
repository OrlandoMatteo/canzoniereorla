[<pre>Re
I can almost see it
   
That dream I’m dreaming but
Sol
There’s a voice inside my head sayin,
Mim            La
You’ll never reach it,
Re
Every step I’m taking,
  
Every move I make feels
Sol
Lost with no direction
Mim            La   
My faith is shaking but
Sim            Fa#m
I got to keep trying
        Sol                 Mim  La
Got to keep my head held high

There’s always going to be another mountain
  
I’m always going to want to make it move
Sol
Always going to be an uphill battle,
Mim                    La
Sometimes you going to have to lose,
Re    
Ain’t about how fast I get there,

Ain’t about what’s waiting on the other side

It’s the climb


Re
The struggles I’m facing,
  
The chances I’m taking
Sol
Sometimes they knock me down but
Mim           La
No, I’m not breaking
Re
I may not know it,

But these are the moments that
Sol
I’m going to remember most yeah
Mim               La
Just got to keep going
    Sim
And I,
             Fa#m
I got to be strong
Sol                 Mim  La
Just keep pushing on,
