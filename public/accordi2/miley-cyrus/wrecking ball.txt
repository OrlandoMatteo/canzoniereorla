[<pre>   Sim                        Re                 
We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
      La               Sol
We jumped, never asking why
Sim                   Re   
We kissed, I fell under your spell
   La          Sol 
A love no one could deny

Sim                Re      
Dont you ever say I just walked away
La                 Sol
I will always want you
Sim                  Re   
I cant live a lie, running for my life
La              Sol
I will always want you

                 Re            La
I came in like a wrecking ball
               Sim      Sol
I never hit so hard in love
                    Re          La 
All I wanted was to break your walls
                     Sim    Sol
All you ever did was break me
      Sim        Sol
Yeah, you wreck me


  Sim              Re      
I put you high up in the sky
     La                   Sol
And now, youre not coming down
   Sim                  Re  
It slowly turned, you let me burn
    La                        Sol
And now, we’re ashes on the ground

I never meant to start a war
                                   Re
I just wanted you to let me in
                                Fa#m
And instead of using force
                           Sol
I guess I should’ve let you in

Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
               Re                    La
Left me crouching in a blaze and fall
                             Sim        Sol
All you ever did was  break me
