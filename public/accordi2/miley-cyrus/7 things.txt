  Mi
I probably shouldn't say this
       Mi/Re#
But at times I get so scared
       Do#m7
When I think about the previous
  Si4
Relationship we've shared
       Laadd9
It was awesome

But we lost it
         Si4
It's not possible
              Do#m7
For me not to care
    Si        Laadd9
And now we're standing in the rain
              Si4
But nothing's ever gonna change
          Do#m11
Until you hear   ...My dear

                          Mi  Mi/Re# Do#m7
The 7 things I hate about you
    Si                 Laadd9     Si4
The 7 things I hate about you (oh you)
Mi              Si/Re#                Do#m7
 You're vain, your games, you're insecure
             Si
You love me, you like her
    Laadd9
You make me laugh, you make me cry
  Si
I don't know which side to buy
Mi                    Mi/Re#
 Your friends they're jerks
                  Do#m7
When you act like them
             Si4
Just know it hurts
  Laadd9                  Si
I wanna be with the one I know
        Mi/Sol#     Laadd9                 Si4
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do
                 Mi
You make me love you

     Mi
It's awkward and silent
     Mi/Re#
As I wait for you to say
    Do#m7
But what I need to hear now
        Si4
Is your sincere apology
         Laadd9
When you mean it  I'll believe it
       Si4
If you text it I'll delete it
         Do#m9
Let's be clear
           Laadd9
Oh I'm not coming back
       Si4          Do#m9
You're taking 7 steps here

                          Mi
The 7 things I hate about you
               Si/Re#                Do#m7
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
             Si
You love me, you like her
    Laadd9
You make me laugh, you make me cry
  Si
I don't know which side to buy
Mi                    Mi/Re#
 Your friends they're jerks
                  Do#m7
When you act like them
             Si4
Just know it hurts
  Laadd9                  Si
I wanna be with the one I know
        Mi/Sol#     Laadd9                 Si4
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do
                 Mi
You make me love you

    Mi
And compared to all the great things
           Si/Re#
That would take too long to write
  Do#m7
I probably should mention
    Si4
The 7 that I like

                          Mi
The 7 things I like about you
              Mi/Re#              Do#m7
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
                 Si4
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
    Laadd9
You make me laugh, you make me cry
      Si
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Mi          Mi/Re#
 Your hand in mine
                 Do#m7
When we're intertwined
               Si4
Everything's alright
  Laadd9                    Si
I want to be with the one I know
        Mi/Sol#     Laadd9                 Si
And the 7th thing I like the most that you do
                 Mi
You make me love you
          Laadd9  Si4  Do#m7
You do...

Laadd9  Si4  Do#m11
