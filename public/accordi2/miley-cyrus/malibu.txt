Sol#                       Sol#4            Sol#   Sol#4
I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
Dom                Do#             Dom
I never sat by the shore under the sun
                  Do#
 with my feet in the sand
                 Sol#            Sol#4         Sol#
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
       Sol#4      Sol#             Sol#4      Sol#    Sol#4
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind
Sol#                               Sol#4  Sol#   Sol#4
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
  Dom
I never went boatin',
      Do#
don't get how they are floatin'
    Dom                Do#
And sometimes I get so scared
                   Fam     La#m7
Of what I can't understand
           Sol#  Dom7
But here I am
        Fam  La#m7
Next to you
           Sol#       Dom7
The sky's more blue
    Fam    La#m7
In Malibu
         Sol#  Dom7
Next to you
    Fam    La#m7
In Malibu
         Sol# Dom7
Next to you, baby

Sol#                        Sol#4       Sol#     Sol#4
We watched the sun go down as we were walking
Sol#                          Sol#4
I'd spend the rest of my life
                   Sol#       Sol#4
just standing here talking
Sol#4                          Sol#4     Sol#    Sol#4
You would explain the current as I just smile
Dom                     Do#
Hoping that you'll stay the same
                 Dom
and nothing will change
          Do#              Sol#
And it'll be us just for a while
        Sol#4 Sol#
Do they even exist?
            Sol#4   Sol#
That's when I make the wish
                            Sol#4
To swim away with the fish
   Sol#                        Sol#4    Sol#     Sol#4
Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
Dom              Do#
I never would've believed you
               Dom
If three years ago you told me
    Do#                 Fam   La#m7
I'd be here writing this song
           Sol#  Dom7
But here I am
        Fam   La#m7
Next to you
          Sol#     Dom7
The sky's so blue
    Fam    La#m7
In Malibu
        Sol#  Dom7
Next to you
    Fam   La#m7
In Malibu
        Sol#  Dom7
Next to you, baby

Next to you

Sol#                            Sol#4        Sol#     Sol#4
We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sol#                         Sol#4
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
                    Sol#
and you're there to save me
             Sol#4                  Sol#
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
       Sol#4   Sol#
It's a brand new start
   Sol#4   Sol#
A dream come true
