 Yeah, it's been a long night and the mirror's 
telling me to go home
Do                                  Lam
 But it's been a long time since I felt this 
good on my own (Uh)
Mim                           Sim
 Lotta years went by with my hands tied up in 
your ropes (Your ropes)
   Do                 Lam
Forever and ever, no more (No more)

Mim                                       Sim
 She got her hair pulled back 'cause the sweat's drippin' 
off of her face (Her face)
Do                            Lam
 Said, "It ain't so bad if I wanna make a couple mistakes"
Mim                                Sim
 You should know right now that I never 
stay put in one place
   Do                 Lam
Forever and ever, no more (No more)
