 This is the way you left me
Sol#
 I'm not pretending
La#m
 No hope, no love, no glory
Fa#
 No happy ending

La#m            Sol#      Fa#        Do#
 Wake up in the morning, stumble on my life
La#m       Sol#              Fa#    Do#
 Can't get no love without sacrifice
La#m                Sol#          Fa#            Do#
 If anything should happen, I'd guess I wish you well
La#m                Sol#           Fa#            Do#
Mm, a little bit of heaven, but a little bit of hell
La#m                     Sol#
 This is the hardest story
                   Fa#
That I have ever told

No hope, or love, or glory
              Sol#          Do#
Happy endings gone forever more

 Sol#              La#m    Fa#  Sol#
I  feel as if I'm wasted
    Do# Sol#           La#m  Fa#   Sol#
And I     wasted everyday
Do#
This is the way you left me
Sol#
I'm not pretending
La#m7
No hope, no love, no glory
Fa#        Sol#  Do#
 No happy ending

This is the way that we love
Sol#
 Like it's forever
La#m
 Then live the rest of our life
Fa#         Sol#
 But not together

La#m              Sol#        Fa#             Do#
 Two o'clock in the morning, something's on my mind
La#m       Sol#           Fa#     Do#
 Can't get no rest, keep walkin' around
La#m       Sol#             Fa#       Do#
 If I pretend that nothin' ever went wrong
La#m        Sol#
 I can get to my sleep
                    Fa#          Do#
I can think that we just carried on
La#m                     Sol#
 This is the hardest story
                   Fa#
That I have ever told

No hope, or love, or glory

I     feel as if I'm wasted

And I     wasted everyday

              Do#    Sol#  La#m  Fa#
Little bit of love...
                     Do#  Sol#
There ain't a better love
              La#m
Little bit of love
                 Fa#
Need to be love, love

Little bit of love
