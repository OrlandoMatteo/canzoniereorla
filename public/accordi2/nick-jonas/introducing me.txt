I, I'm good at wasting time
                        Mim
I think lyrics need to rhyme
And you're not asking
          Do
But I'm trying to grow a mustache
       Sol                          Re
I eat cheese, but only on pizza, please
                    Mim
And sometimes on a homemade quesadilla
  Do
Otherwise it smells like feet to me

Lam                                Sim
And I, I really like it when the moon looks like a toenail
       La                        Do        Re
And I love you when you say my na-a-a-a-ame

If you wanna know here it goes gonna tell you this
    Re
The part of me that'll show if you're close 
Gonna let you see 
Mim
everything
    Do
But remember that you asked for it
    Sol
I'll try to do my best to impress
But it's easier
    Re
to let you take a guess at the rest
But you wanna hear
    Mim
what lives in my brain
    Do
My heart, will you ask for it,
    Lam
for your perusing?
    Sim
At times confusing, 
Do
slightly amusing

  Sol                              Re
I never trust a dog to watch my food
                               Mim
And I like to use to the word "dude"
                   Do
As a noun, or an adverb, or an adjective
          Sol                      Re
And I've never really been into cars
                     Mim
I like really cool guitars and superheroes
      Do
And checks with lots of zeros on 'em
  Lam                  Sim
I love the sound of violins
     La               Do        Re
And making someone smi-i-i-i-ile

Well, you probably know more than you ever wanted to
