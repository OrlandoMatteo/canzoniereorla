       Solm  Fa  Rem  Do   Lam7

       Rem     Do            Sol/Si  La#
In the white room with black curtains
 Do      Rem  Do  Sol/Si  La#
near the station
 Do        Rem    Do        Sol/Si  La#
Black-roof country, no gold pavements,
 Do   Rem    Do  Sol/Si  La#
tired starlings
 Do    Rem   Do        Sol/Si   La#
Silver horses run down moonbeams
   Do   Rem     Do  Sol/Si  La#
in your dark eyes
  Do       Rem  Do       Sol/Si  La#
Dawn-light smiles on you leaving,
Do    Rem    Do  Sol/Si  La#
my contentment

Do                Sol             La#       La
I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines
Do           Sol             La#     Do         Re
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves

         Rem      Do        Sol/Si  La#
You said no strings could secure you
 Do    Rem  Do  Sol/Si  La#
at the station
   Do    Rem    Do        Sol/Si  La#
Platform ticket, restless diesels,
  Do    Rem  Do  Sol/Si  La#
goodbye windows
  Do     Rem  Do      Sol/Si  La#
I walked into  such a sad time
  Do   Rem  Do  Sol/Si  La#
at the station
  Do Rem       Do        Sol/Si  La#
As I walked out, felt my own need
 Do    Rem  Do  Sol/Si  La# Do
just beginning

     Do          Sol            La#         La
I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
Do       Sol           La#     La         Re
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves

Solm  Fa  Rem  Do     Solm  Fa  Rem  Do   Lam7

       Rem  Do       Sol/Si  La#
At the party she was kindness
   Do  Rem      Do  Sol/Si  La#
in the hard crowd
Do   Rem   Do       Sol/Si  La#
Consolation for the old wound
  Do   Rem  Do  Sol/Si  La#
now forgotten
  Do   Rem   Do           Sol/Si  La#
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles
   Do  Rem      Do  Sol/Si  La#
in her dark eyes
   Do      Rem    Do         Sol/Si  La#
She's just dressing, goodbye windows,
 Do   Rem  Do  Sol/Si  La# Do
tired starlings

     Do            Sol            La#    La
I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd
Do         Sol            La#     Do         Re
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves
