I don't wanna talk about the things we've gone through
                    Sol#m/Re#   Do#
Though it's hurting me now it's history
            Fa#                                 Do#/Fa
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too
                Sol#m/Re#       Do#
Nothing more to say no more ace to play

                    Fa#     La#/Re       Re#m
The winner takes it all the loser standing small
  Re#/Sol       Sol#m             Do#7sus4  Do#
Beside the victory  that's her destiny

              Fa#            Do#add9/Fa
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there
                  Sol#m/Re#            Do#
I figured it made sense -building me a fence
            Fa#                Do#add9/Fa
Building me a home thinking I'd be strong there
            Sol#m/Re#         Do#7sus4   Do#
But I was a fool playing by the rules

               Fa#              La#/Re   Re#m
The gods may throw a dice their minds as cold as ice
    Re#/Sol Sol#m               Do#7sus4       Do#
And someone way down here loses someone dear
                    Fa#     La#/Re       Re#m
The winner takes it all the loser has to fall
     Re#/Sol    Sol#m          Do#7sus4            Do#
It's simple and it's plain why should i complain

                     Fa#                 Do#/Fa
But tell me does she kiss Like I used to kiss you?
                 Sol#m/Re#           Do#
Does it feel the same when she calls your name?
              Fa#                    Do#add9/Fa
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you
            Sol#m/Re#             Do#7sus4  Do#
But what can I say rules must be obeyed

                  Fa#      La#/Re     Re#m
The judges will decide the likes of me abide
Re#/Sol        Sol#m           Do#7sus4     Do#
Spectators of the show always staying low
             Fa#       La#/Re     Re#m
The game is on again a lover or a friend
  Re#/Sol   Sol#m                       Do#7sus4  Do#
A big thing or a small the winner takes it all

              Fa#                  Do#/Fa
I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad
           Sol#m/Re#                Do#7sus4    Do#
And I understand you've come to shake my hand
       Fa#                  Do#add9/Fa
I apologise if it makes you feel bad
             Sol#m/Re#         Do#7sus4              Do#
Seeing me so tense  no self-confidence   ..but you see

                    Fa#     La#/Re Re#m
The winner takes it all...
    Re#/Sol      Sol#m    Do#7sus4  Do#
The winner takes it all...
Fa#          La#/Re Re#m        Re#/Sol Sol#m
 So the winner,      takes it all
              Do#7sus4       Do#
And the loser,   has to fall

Fa#   La#/Re Re#m   Re#/Sol Sol#m
