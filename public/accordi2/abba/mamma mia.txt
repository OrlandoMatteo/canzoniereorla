Re          La/Re      Re                      Sol
  I've been cheated by you, since I don't know when
Re   La/Re      Re                       Sol
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
Re              Re5
Look at me now,   will I ever learn?
Re                Re5             Sol
I don't know how,   but I suddenly lose control
                   La
There's a fire within my soul
Sol  Re/Fa#  La
Just one     look and I can hear a bell ring
Sol  Re/Fa#  La
One more     look and I forget everything.. woo oh

Re
  Mamma mia, here I go again
Sol4      Sol
  My  my, how can I resist you?
Re
Mamma mia, does it show again?
Sol4     Sol
  My my, just how much I've missed you

Re               La/Do#
  Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Sim              Fa#m/La
  Blue since the day we parted
Sol4       Mim        La
  Why, why did I ever let you go?
Re           Sim
  Mamma mia,   now I really know,
Sol4     Mim           La
  My my, I could never let you go.

I've been angry and sad about the things that you do
Re      La/Re         Re                             Sol
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
Re               Re5
And when you go,   when you slam the door
Re                Re5                 Sol
I think you know,   that you won't be away too long
                  La
You know that I'm not that strong.
