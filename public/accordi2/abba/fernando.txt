       La     Re Mi Re/Fa# Mi/Sol# La

                          La
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
                                              Fa#m
I remember long ago another starry night like this
                    Sim
In the firelight Fernando
                                                          Mi
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar

I could hear the distant drums
                                            La
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
                                              Fa#m
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
                   Sim
I was so afraid Fernando
                                                          Mi
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die

And I'm not ashamed to say
                                       La
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

                           Mi
There was something in the air that night
                          La
The stars were bright, Fernando
                            Mi
They were shining there for you and me
                La
For liberty, Fernando
          Sol6                        Fa#7
Though we never thought that we could lose
             Si
There's no regret
                   Mi
If I had to do the same again
                       La
I would, my friend, Fernando
                   Mi
If I had to do the same again
                       Re    Mi Re/Fa# Mi/Sol# La
I would, my friend, Fernando

Mi   La

                          La
Now we're old and grey Fernando
                                                Fa#m
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
                       Sim
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
                                                         Mi
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?

I can see it in your eyes
                                                La
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

                           Mi
There was something in the air that night
                          La
The stars were bright, Fernando
                            Mi
They were shining there for you and me
                La
For liberty, Fernando
          Sol6                        Fa#7
Though we never thought that we could lose
             Si
There's no regret

If I had to do the same again
                       La
I would, my friend, Fernando
