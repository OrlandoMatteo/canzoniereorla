 Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong
         La      Re La           Mi
You're enchained by your own sorrow
 Re/Fa#  Mi           Mi7     La          La4  La
In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow
                                 Re/La La
How I hate to see you like this
                Do#m
There is no way you can deny it
Mi Re   Mi               Mi7   La         La4 La
I... can see that you're oh so sad, so quiet
                              La4 La
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
           Re  La        Mi
I'm a shoulder you can cry on
  Re      Mi              Mi7     La          La4 La
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on
                                 La4 La
You were always sure of yourself
                 Do#m
Now I see you've broken a feather
Mi Re Mi        Mi7        La       La4 La
I.... hope we can patch it up together

Chiquitita, you and I know

How the heartaches come and they go
        La
and the scars they're leaving
                        Mi           Re        Mi
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end
         Mi7     La
You will have no time for grieving
                      Re
Chiquitita, you and I cry
                                    La
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you
                          Mi            Re    Mi
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before
       Mi7       La
Sing a new song, Chiquitita
         Mi            Re    Mi
Try once more like you did before
       Mi9       La          La4 La
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

So the walls came tumbling down
                            Mi
And your love's a blown out candle
  Re   Mi          Mi7       La          La4 La
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle
                             La4 La
Chiquitita, tell me the truth
