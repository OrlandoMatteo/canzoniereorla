Fa#
 Like an unsung melody

The truth is waiting there for you to find it

It's not a blight, but a remedy,
                              Si
A clear reminder of how it began

Deep inside your memory
                                          Fa#
You turned away As you struggled to find it

You heard it call as you walked away

A voice of calm from within the silence

And for what seemed an eternity
                                      Si
You waited Hoping it would call out again

You heard the shadow beckoning
                                        Fa#
Then your fear seemed to keep you blinded

You held your guard as you walked away

         Do#/Fa Re#m      Do#
When you think all is forsaken,
             Si
Listen to me now

Hope's not forsaken
                             Sol#m
You need never feel broken again
          Si                         Fa#
Sometimes darkness can show you the light

Fa#
 An unforgivable tragedy

The answer isn't where you think you'd find it

Prepare yourself for a reckoning
                                        Si
For when your world seems to crumble again

Don't be afraid, don't turn away
                                  Fa#
You're the one who can redefine it

Don't let hope become a memory

Let the shadow permeate your mind and

Reveal the thoughts that were tucked away
                                  Si
So that the door can be opened again

Within your darkest memories
                                      Fa#
Lies the answer if you dare to find it

Don't let hope become a memory

         Do#/Fa Re#m      Do#
When you think all is forsaken,
             Si
Listen to me now

Hope's not forsaken
                              Sol#m
You need never feel broken again
          Si                         Fa#5   Sol5 Mi5
Sometimes darkness can show you the light

Fa#5     Sol5 Mi5

Fa#5
Sickening, weakening

Don't let another somber pariah consume your soul

You need strengthening, toughening
                                       Mi5  Sol5       Si5
It takes a bit of dark to rekindle the fire burning in you
                       Fa#
Ignite the fire within you

         Do#/Fa Re#m       Do#
When you think all is forsaken,
             Si
Listen to me now

Hope's not forsaken
                             Sol#m
You need never feel broken again
          Si                        Re#m
Sometimes darkness can show you the light
        Do#              Si
Don't ignore, listen to me now
                              Sol#m
You need never feel broken again
          Si
Sometimes darkness...
                  Fa#
Can show you the light
