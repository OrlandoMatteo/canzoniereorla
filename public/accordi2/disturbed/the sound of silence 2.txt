Fa#m                   Mi
 Hello, darkness, my old friend
                         Fa#m
I've come to talk with you again
                      Re    La
Because a vision softly creeping,
                         Re    La
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
        Re                              La
And the vision that was planted in my brain
    Fa#m
Still remains
           Mi       Fa#m
Within the sound of silence

                             Mi
In restless dreams I walked alone
                       Fa#m
Narrow streets of cobblestone
                   Re       La
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
                          Re       La
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
        Re                       Re/Fa#          La
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
Sim7       Fa#m       La
 That split the night
                Mi       Fa#m
And touched the sound of silence

                        Mi
And in the naked light I saw
                         Fa#m
Ten thousand people, maybe more
                  Re       La
People talking without speaking
                   Re       La
People hearing without listening
               Re                      La
People writing songs that voices never share
         Fa#m    La  Fa#m
And no one dare
   La       Mi       Fa#m
Disturb the sound of silence

                          Mi
"Fools," said I, "You do not know
                     Fa#m
Silence, like a cancer, grows
                        Re       La
Hear my words that I might teach you
                       Re       La
Take my arms that I might reach you,"
      Re                            La   Fa#m
But my words like silent raindrops fell
    La            Mi       Fa#m
And echoed in the wells of silence

                         Mi
And the people bowed and prayed
                 Fa#m
To the neon god they made
                         Re     La
And the sign flashed out its warning
                       Re   La
In the words that it was forming

And the sign said,
     Re
"The words of the prophets
                           La
are written on the subway walls
           Fa#m    La
And tenement halls
    Fa#m             Mi       Fa#m
And whispered in the sound of silence
