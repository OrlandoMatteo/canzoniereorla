Fa#5
 As I survey the chaos,

taking in the lack of raw humanity

It's as if the entire world's
          Do5               La5
fallen in love with their insanity
Fa#5
 Hear the innocent voices scream

As their tormentors laugh through all of it

No forgiveness for all I've seen
       Do5         La5
A degradation I cannot forget
Fa#m                     Mi/Sol#
So sleep soundly in your beds tonight
    La                       Fa#5
For judgement falls upon you at first light

        Sol5 Mi5 Fa#5
I'm the hand of  God
        Sol5 Mi5 Fa#5
I'm the dark messiah
        Sol5 Mi5 Fa#5
I'm the vengeful one

       Sol5 Mi5 Fa#5         Sol5  Fa#5
In the blackest moments of a dying world
          Sol5 Mi5 Fa#5
What have you  be--come
 La5                      Mi5        Sol5

Fa#5
 As the violence surges

And the teeming masses have been terrorized

Their human predators... all gone mad
            Do5                     La5
Are reaping profits born from their demise
Fa#5
 The rabid media plays their role

Stoking the flames of war to no surprise

Only too eager to sell their souls
        Do5                La5
For the apocalypse must be televised
Fa#m                     Mi/Sol#

When you die

You'll know why

For you cannot be saved

With all the world enslaved

When you die
               La#5
You'll know why

When you die

You'll know why

For you could not be saved

This world is too depraved

When you die
