Can you feel that?

Oh shit..

Oh, wah, ah, ah, ah!!

Oh, wah, ah, ah, ah!!

Drowning deep in my sea of loathing

Broken your servant I kneel

(Will you give in to me?)

It seems what’s left of my human side

Is slowly changing in me

(Will you give in to me?)

Looking at my own reflection

When suddenly it changes

Violently it changes (oh no)

There is no turning back now

You’ve woken up the demon in me

 Get up, come on get down with the sickness

Get up, come on get down with the sickness

Get up, come on get down with the sickness

Open up your hate, and let it flow into me

Get up, come on get down with the sickness

You mother get up, come on get down with the sickness

You fucker get up, come on get down with the sickness

Madness is the gift, that has been given to me

Re#5
I can see inside you, the sickness is rising

Don’t try to deny what you feel

(Will you give in to me?)

It seems that all that was good has died

And is decaying in me

(Will you give in to me?)

It seems you’re having some trouble

In dealing with these changes

Living with these changes (oh no)

The world is a scary place

Now that you’ve woken up the demon in me

 Get up, come on get down with the sickness

Get up, come on get down with the sickness

Get up, come on get down with the sickness

Open up your hate, and let it flow into me

Get up, come on get down with the sickness

You mother get up, come on get down with the sickness

You fucker get up, come on get down with the sickness

Madness is the gift, that has been given to me

 Get up, come on get down with the sickness

You fucker get up, come on get down with the sickness
