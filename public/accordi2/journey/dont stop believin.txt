[<pre>Mi      Si             Do#m           La
Just a small town girl, living in a lonely world
Mi           Si                     Sol#m   La
She took the midnight train going anywhere
Mi      Si      Do#m                   La
Just a city boy, born and raised in south Detroit
Mi          Si                     Sol#m   La
He took the midnight train going anywhere

Mi             Si        Do#m                    La
A singer in a smoky room, a smell of wine and cheap perfume
Mi                    Si                        Sol#m           La
For a smile they can share the night, it goes on and on and on and on


La                 Mi
Strangers waiting up and down the boulevard
 La                      Mi
Their shadows searching in the night
La                    Mi
Streetlight, people, living just to find emotion
La                        Si
Hiding, somewhere in the night


Mi               Si         Do#m          La
Working hard to get my fill, everybody wants a thrill
       Mi           Si                   Sol#m      La
Paying anything to roll the dice, just one more time
Mi              Si               Do#m               La         
Some will win, some will lose, some were born to sing the blues
 Mi            Si                   Sol#m           La
Oh, the movie never ends; it goes on and on and on and on


La               Mi
Strangers waiting up and down the boulevard
 La                             Mi
Their shadows searching in the night
La                  Mi
Streetlight, people, living just to find emotion
La                        Si
Hiding, somewhere in the night


Mi             Si       Do#m            La
Don't stop believing hold on to the feeling
Mi          Si           Sol#m           La
Streetlight people
Mi             Si       Do#m            La
