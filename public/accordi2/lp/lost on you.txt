When you get older, plainer, saner
          Re                               Mim
Will you remember all the danger we came from
             Lam
Burning like embers, falling, tender
                Re
Longing for the days of no surrender
      Mim
Years ago
  Mim
And well you know

Smoke 'em if you got them

'Cause it's going down
Mim                       Mim7
All I ever wanted was you

Let's raise a glass or two


   Mim               Lam
To all the things I lost on you
   Re
Oh oh
                 Mim
Tell me are they lost on you?
   Do
Oh oh
                    Lam
Just that you could cut me loose
   Re
Oh oh

Wishing I could see the machinations
               Re                            Mim
Understand the toil of expectations in your mind
                 Lam
Hold me like you never lost your patience
                 Re                                    Mim
Tell me that you love me more than hate me all the time
Mim
And you're still mine


   Lam
So smoke 'em if you've got 'em
            Re
'Cause it's going down
Mim
All I ever wanted was you
      Do
Let's take a drink of heaven
