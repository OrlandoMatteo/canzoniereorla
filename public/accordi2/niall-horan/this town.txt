[<pre>Sol
Waking up to kiss you and nobody’s there
Mim7
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
Doadd9   
It’s hard
Sol
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running round
     Mim7
It’s funny how things never change in this old town
   Doadd9        Re
So far from the stars


Lam7                      Re
  And I want to tell you everything
                  Sol              Sol/Fa#        Mim7
The words I never got to say the first time around
Lam7              Re
  And I remember everything
                      Sol                   Sol/Fa#    Mim7
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
                          Do
Wish I was there with you now


       Mim7
If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
      Doadd9
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Sol
Over and over the only truth
Mim   Re           Sol       Doadd9
Everything comes back to you
Mim7  Re Sol
Mmm-mm-mm


  Sol
I saw that you moved on with someone new
       Mim
In the pub that we met he’s got his arms around you
     Doadd9   
It’s so hard
   Re
So hard

Mim   Re           Sol       Doadd9
Everything comes back to you
    Sol
You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
     Mim7
Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you
Doadd9
Over and over the only truth
Mim7   Re           Sol       Doadd9
Everything comes back to you
Mim7  Re Sol
Mmm-mm-mm


Mim7                     Re/Fa#
  And I know that it’s wrong
                  Sol
That I can’t move on
                            Doadd9
But there’s something about you


       Mim7
If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
      Doadd9
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Sol
Over and over the only truth
Mim7   Re           Sol       Doadd9
Everything comes back to you
    Sol
You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
     Mim7 
Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you


Doadd9
Over and over the only truth
Mim7  Re           Sol       Doadd9
Everything comes back to you
Mim7  Re Sol
Mmm-mm-mm
Mim7  Re           Sol       Doadd9
Everything comes back to you
Mim7  Re Sol
Mmm-mm-mm</pre>]
