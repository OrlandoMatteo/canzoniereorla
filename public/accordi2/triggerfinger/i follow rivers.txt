Dom          Solm            Dom
 Oh I beg you: can I follow?
            Solm             Dom
Oh I ask you: why not always?
            Solm              Dom
Be the ocean, where I unravel,
          Solm
Be my only, be the water where I'm wading
Dom                            La#
 You're my river running high,
         Solm
Run deep, run wild

Re#        Dom
I-I follow, I follow you
Solm         La#
Deep sea baby, I follow you
Re#       Dom
I-I follow, I follow you
Solm           La#
Dark moon honey, I follow you

Dom            Solm             Dom
 He's a message  I'm the runner
              Solm
He the rebel
                                 Dom
I'm the daughter waiting for you
                             La#
You're my river running high
          Solm
Run deep, run wild

Re#        Dom

Dark moon honey, I follow you
