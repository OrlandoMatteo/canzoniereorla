Give me a second I 

I need to get my story straight
     Lam
My friends are in the bathroom

Getting higher than the empire state
     Rem
My lover she's waiting for me

Just across the bar
              Fa
My seats been taken by some sunglasses
Sol
Asking 'bout a scar

    Do 
And I know I gave it to you months ago
Lam
 I know you're trying to forget
       Rem
But between the drinks and subtle things

The holes in my apologies
        Fa                          Sol
You know I'm trying hard to take it back


              Rem      Mim
So if by the time the bar closes
         Lam        Sol       Fa
And you feel like falling down
       Fa       Sol
I'll carry you home


  Do
Tonight
       Lam
We are young
                          Fa
So let's set the world on fire

We can burn brighter
         Sol4  Sol
Than the sun
  Do
Tonight

Now I know that I'm not

All that you got

I guess that I
                                                     Rem

But our friends are back

So let's raise a cup
Fa                         Sol
 Cause I found someone to carry me home
