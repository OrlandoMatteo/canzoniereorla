Oh, the weather outside is frightful
        Re#m7   Re#7  Sol#7
But the fire is so delightful
    La#7                    Re#m7
And since we've no place to go
                    Sol#7         Do#
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Sol#7add6          Do#
Man, It doesn't show signs of stopping
      Fam7        Re#7      Re#m7   Sol#7
And I brought some corn for popping
    Re#m7      La#7            Re#m7
The lights are turned way down low
       Sol#7         Do#
Let it snow, let it snow

        Sol#                      Ladim
When we finally kiss good-night
    La#m7           Re#7       Sol#
How I'll hate going out in the storm
                          Dom7    Fa7
But if you really hold me tight
La#7        Re#7         Sol#7  Sol#7add6
All the way home I'll be warm

    Do#
The fire is slowly dying
        Re#m7       Re#7       Sol#
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing
       Re#m7       La#7    Re#m7
But as long as you love me so
                    Sol#7         Do#
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
