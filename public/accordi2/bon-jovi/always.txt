Do#m
This romeo is bleeding
Si
but you can't see his blood
La
It's nothing but some feelings
          Do#m              Si
that this old dog kicked up

Do#m
It's been raining since you left me
          Si
now I'm drowning in the flood
La
You see I've always been a fighter
       Si               La Si Do#m
but without you I give up

Do#m
Now I can't sing a love song
          Si
like the way it's meant to be
La
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
     Si                 La Si
but baby, that's just me


      Mi       Si          La
Yeah, I will love you, baby
Do#m  Si
Always
    Mi                Si           La
And I'll be there forever and a day
Do#m  Si
Always
Mi
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
          Si
till the heavens burst and

the words don't rhyme
            La
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
          Si
and I'll love you
La Si Do#m
Always


Do#m
Now your pictures that you left behind
Si
are just memories of a different life
La
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
                Do#m                Si
One that made you have to say goodbye
Do#m
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
              Si
to touch your lips, to hold you near
La
When you say your prayers try to understand
          Si                     La Si Do#m
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man

        Do#m
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
                 Si
when he says the words you've been needing to hear
          La
I'll wish I was him 'cause those words are mine
   Si                   La      Si
to say to you till the end of time


      Mi       Si          La
Yeah, I will love you, baby
Do#m  Si
Always
    Mi                Si           La
And I'll be there forever and a day
Do#m  Si
Always


Re                    Sol
  If you told me to cry for you
La
  I could
Re                    Sol          La
  If you told me to die for you
    Sim
I would
       La           Sol
Take a look at my face
                         La
There's no price I won't pay

to say these words to you


Mi  Si  La  Do#m Si
Mi  Si  La  Si  La  Si  La

La
Well, there ain't no luck

in these loaded dice
      Si
But baby if you give me just one more try
         La
we can pack up our old dreams

and our old lives
        Si
We'll find a place where the sun still shines


      Mi       Si          La
Yeah, I will love you, baby
Do#m  Si
Always
    Mi                Si           La
And I'll be there forever and a day
Do#m  Si
Always
Mi
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
          Si
till the heavens burst and

the words don't rhyme
            La
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
          Si
and I'll love you
La Si Mi
Always</pre>]
