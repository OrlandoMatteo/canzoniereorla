[<pre>La#  Fa  La#  Fa  (x2)


 La#
Sitting here wasted and wounded
           Fa
This old piano
        La#
Trying hard to capture the moment
                Fa
This morning I don't know
          Lam                       La#
'Cause a bottle of vodka is still lodged in my head
           Fa
And some blond gave me nightmares
                         La#
Think she's still in my bed
       La#                     Do                         Fa
As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead


        La#
With an ironclad fist
                                Fa
I wake up, and French kiss the morning
            La#
While some marching band keeps its own beat
                      Fa
In my head while we're talking
      Lam                         La#
About all of the things, that I long to believe
       Fa
About love, the truth, what you mean to me
          La#
And the truth is
 La#          Do           Fa   Fa  Do Do
Baby, you're all that I need


         Rem Rem
I wanna lay
     Do         La#     Fa
You down in a bed of roses
       Rem  Rem
For tonight
    Do         La#     Fa
I sleep on a bed of nails
               La#
Oh, I want to be
          Fa
Just as close as
     La#    Fa
The Holy Ghost is
     Rem  Do   La#  La#
And lay you down
La#      La#    Fa
  On a bed of roses


           La#
Well, I'm so far away
                                Fa
Each step that I take is on my way home
          La#
A King's ransom in dimes
                                      Fa
Given each night to see through this payphone
         Lam
Still I run out of time
         La#
Or it's hard to get through
          Fa
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
      La#
I'll just close my eyes, whisper
 La#     Do             Fa  Fa Do Do
Baby, blind love is true


         Rem Rem
I wanna lay
     Do         La#     Fa
You down in a bed of roses
       Rem  Rem
For tonight
    Do         La#     Fa
I sleep on a bed of nails
               La#
Oh, I want to be
          Fa
Just as close as
     La#    Fa
The Holy Ghost is
     Rem  Do   La#  La#
And lay you down
La#      La#    Fa     Do
  On a bed of roses


            La#
Well, this hotel bar hangover
  Do                         Fa
Whiskey's gone dry, the barkeeper's wig's crooked

And she's giving me the eye
   La#
I might have said yeah
       La#             Do          Fa  Fa Do   Do
But I laughed so hard I think I died, uh yeah!...


Rem  Do  La#  Fa  (x3)
Rem  Do  La#  La#  La#  La# Fa


        La#
Now as you close your eyes
                        Fa
Know I'll be thinking about you
          La#
While my mistress she calls me
                         Fa
To stand in her spotlight again
            La#
Tonight, I won't be alone
                                      Fa
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
          Rem          Do             La#
I've got nothing to prove for it's you
          La#       Fa   Do
That I'd die to defend


         Rem Rem
I wanna lay
     Do         La#     Fa
You down in a bed of roses
       Rem  Rem
For tonight
    Do         La#     Fa
I sleep on a bed of nails
               La#
Oh, I want to be
          Fa
Just as close as
     La#    Fa
The Holy Ghost is
     Rem  Do   La#  La# La#
And lay you down
         Rem Rem
I wanna lay
     Do         La#     Fa
You down in a bed of roses
       Rem  Rem
For tonight
    Do         La#  Fa
I sleep on a be...ed of nails!
           La#
I want to be

Just as close as
     La#    Fa
The Holy Ghost is!
 Rem  Do   La# ( La#)
Lay you down
(La#)    ( La#)   Fa
    On a bed of roses</pre>]
