Every day it seems we're wasting away

Another place where the faces are so cold

Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days
        Do           Sol          Fa            Re
And the people I meet  always go their separate ways

Sometimes you tell the day
       Do          Sol
By the bottle that you drink
    Do                 Sol       Fa        Re
And times when you're alone all you do is think

And I walk these streets, a loaded six string on my back

I play for keeps, 'cause I might not make it back

I've been everywhere, and still I'm standing tall
