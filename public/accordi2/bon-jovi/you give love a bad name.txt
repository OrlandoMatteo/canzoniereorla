Shot through the heart

And you're to blame

Darling, you give love a bad name

An angel's smile is what you sell

You promise me heaven, then put me through hell

Chains of love got a hold on me

When passion's a prison, you can't break free
Fa                            Dom
Oh, oh, you're a loaded gun
La#
Oh, oh, there's nowhere to run
   Fa
No one can save me
    Sol
The damage is done

Paint your smile on your lips

Blood red nails on your fingertips

A school boy's dream, you act so shy

Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye
