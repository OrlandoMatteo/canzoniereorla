Do/Mi           Re/Mi         Mim
Once upon a time not so long ago

Mim
Tommy used to work on the docks

Union's been on strike

He's down on his luck
     Do/Mi Re/Mi  Mim
It's tough,    so tough

Gina works the diner all day

Working for her man

She brings home her pay
    Do/Mi Re/Mi  Mim
For love,    for love
                       Do   Re               Mim
She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
   Do             Re                          Mim
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
      Do        Re                Mim
We've got each other and that's a lot
    Do         Re
For love we'll give it a shot"

Mim Do      Re
Whoa, we're half-way there
Sol Do Re

Mim     Do          Re
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Sol Do Re                  Mim

Mim
Tommy's got his six string in hock

Now he's holding in

What he used to make it talk
   Do/Mi Re/Mi  Mim
So tough,  it's tough

Gina dreams of running away

When she cries in the night

Tommy whispers,
            Do/Mi Re/Mi Mim
"Baby, it's okay,     someday
            Do   Re               Mim
We've gotta hold on to what we've got
   Do             Re                          Mim
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
      Do       Re                 Mim
We've got each other and that's a lot
    Do         Re
For love we'll give it a shot"
