Lets talk this over; its not like we're dead.
                       Re                           La
Was it something i did? Was it something you said?
                  Sim                               Sol
Don't leave me hanging in a city so dead.
               Re                                   La           
Held up so high on such a breakable thread.


                Sol                    La       
And you were all the things I thought I knew.
        Sol                            La
And I thought we could be.


         Sol                  Re             La
You were everything, everything that I wanted.
            Sol                    Re                  La
And we were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it.

And all of the memories so close to me just fade away.
Mim                                 Sol              
All this time you were pretending, so much for my happy ending.

You've got your dumb friends, I know what they say.
                    Re                                     La
They tell you I'm difficult, but so are they.
                   Sim                                     Sol 
But they don't know me, do they even know you?
                        Re                                 La
All the things you hide from me,  all the shit that you do.

 It's nice to know that you were there,
Sol                                      La
Thanks for acting like you cared,
                                  Sol
And making me feel like I was the only one.
La                               Sim                          Sol
 It's nice to know we had it all, thanks for watching as I fall,
                            La
And letting me know we were done.
