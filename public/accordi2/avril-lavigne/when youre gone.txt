[<pre>  Sol             Re/Fa#       Mim
I always needed time on my own
                 Do                      Re
I never thought i'd need you there when i cry
        Sol              Re/Fa#           Mim
And the days feel like years when im alone
                      Do                       Re
And the bed where you lie is made up on your side


     Lam                         Sol/Si
When you walk away i count the steps that you take
       Do                             Re
Do you see how much i need you right now


            Do        Mim           Re
When you're gone the pieces of my heart
Are missing you
            Do        Mim                Re
When you're gone the face I came to know is missing to
            Lam               Do
When you're gone the words i need to hear
   Sol             Re/Fa#        Do                Re
To always get me through the day and make it okay

I miss you


     Sol               Re/Fa#  Mim
I've never felt this way before
                  Do                 Re
Everything that I do, reminds me of you
        Sol           Re/Fa#                  Mim
And the clothes you left that lie on the floor
                         Do                               Re
And they smell just like you, I love the things that you do
