         Mi
I can be tough
         Si4
I can be strong
         Do#m
But with you
                      Laadd9
It's not like that at all
          Mi
There's a girl
             Si4
That gives a shit
            Do#m
Behind this wall
                Laadd9
You just walk through it
               Mi
And I remember all those crazy things you said
    Si/Re#
You left them running through my head
       Do#m
You're always there, you're everywhere
    Laadd9
But right now I wish you were here
Mi
All those crazy things we did
 Si/Re#
Didn't think about it, just went with it
       Do#m
You're always there, you're everywhere
    La
But right now I wish you were here

Mi            Si
Damn, damn, damn

What I'd do to have you
Do#m          Laadd9
Here, here, here

I wish you were here
Mi             Si
Damn, damn, damn

What I'd do to have you
Do#m              Laadd9
Near, near, near

I wish you were here

  Mi
I love
            Si4
The way you are
           Do#m
It's who I am
              Laadd9
Don't have to try hard
        Mi
We always say
               Si/Re#
Say it like it is
        Do#m
And the truth
                 Laadd9
Is that I really miss
