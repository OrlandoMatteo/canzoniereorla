Do                 Famaj7     Do/Sol
Stay out super late tonight picking apples, making pies
Do                     Famaj7          Do/Sol
Put a little something in our lemonade and take it with us
             Lam      Famaj7     Sol
We're half awake in a fake empire
             Lam      Famaj7    Sol
We're half awake in a fake empire
Do                 Famaj7       Do/Sol
Tiptoe through our shiny city with our diamond slippers on
Do             Famaj7       Do/Sol
Do our gay ballet on ice, bluebirds on our shoulders
             Lam      Famaj7        Sol
We're half awake in a fake empire
             Lam      Famaj7       Sol
We're half awake in a fake empire

Do                 Famaj7             Do/Sol
Turn the light out say goodnight, no thinking for a little while
Do               Famaj7       Do/Sol
Let's not try to figure out everything at once
     Do           Famaj7         Do/Sol
It's hard to keep track of you falling through the sky
             Lam      Famaj7      Sol
We're half awake in a fake empire
            Lam       Famaj7     Sol
