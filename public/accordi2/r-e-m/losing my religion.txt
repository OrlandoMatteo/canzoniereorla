    Lam              Mim
Oh, life is bigger

It's bigger than you
            Lam
And you are not me.
                        Mim
The lengths that I will go to,
                     Lam      Mim
The distance in your eyes,
                     Rem
Oh no, I've said too much,
         Sol
I set it up.


                 Lam
That's me in the corner,
                 Mim
That's me in the spotlight
            Lam
Losing my religion.
          Mim
Trying to keep up with you.
      Lam                          Mim
And I don't know if I can do it.
                     Rem
Oh no, I've said too much,
                Sol
I haven't said enough.

I thought that I heard you laughing,
 Rem           Sol      Lam  Lam/Si  Lam/Do  Lam/Re
I thought that I heard you sing.
Lam   Fa               Rem   Sol   Lam     Sol
I  think I thought I saw  you try.


          Lam                   Mim
Every whisper of every waking hour
                   Lam
I'm choosing my confessions,
          Mim
Trying to keep an eye on you
       Lam                                 Mim
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool
                     Rem
Oh no, I've said too much,
         Sol
I set it up.


         Lam
Consider this, consider this,
    Mim
The hint of a century,
         Lam
Consider this: the slip
     Mim
That brought me to my knees failed.
Lam
What if all these fantasies
     Mim
Come    flailing around?
         Rem       Sol
Now I've said too much.

    Do               Rem
But that was just a dream,
Do               Rem
That was just a dream.

That was just a dream,    just a dream,
Lam              Sol
