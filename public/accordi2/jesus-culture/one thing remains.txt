[<pre>Domaj9               Sol              Re4
Higher than the mountains that I face
Domaj9               Sol           Re4
Stronger than the power of the grave
Domaj9                Sol              Re4
Constant in the trial and the change
    Do    Sol  Re4
One thing remains
    Do    Sol  Re4
One thing remains

Your love never fails, never gives up
 Sol                Re4
Never runs out on me

Your love never fails, never gives up

Never runs out on me

Your love never fails, never gives up

Never runs out on me 


Domaj9           Sol              Re4
On and on and on and on it goes
Domaj9               Sol            Re4
It overwhelms and satisfies my soul
      Domaj9          Sol           Re4
And I never, ever, have to be afraid
    Domaj9  Sol  Re4
One thing remains

In death, In life, I’m confident and
