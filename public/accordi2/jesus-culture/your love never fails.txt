Mim         Do   
Nothing can separate
Sol         Re
Even if I ran away
Mim                Do     Sol   Re
Your love never fails

Mim            Do   
I know I still make mistakes
       Sol                       Re
But You have new mercies for me everyday

Your love never fails


Do                Sol                 Re
You stay the same through the ages
Lam                Do
Your love never changes
             Sol                 
There may be pain in the night
     Re                 Lam
but joy comes in the morning

Do       Sol             Re
And when the oceans rage
        Lam               Do
I don't have to be afraid
          Sol                     Re
Because I know that You love me
Lam
Your love never fails

The wind is strong and the water's deep
       Sol                        Re
But I'm not alone here in these open seas
      Mim                Do     Sol   Re
Cause Your love never fails
Mim           Do   
The chasm is far too wide
Sol                             Re
I never thought I'd reach the other side
    Mim                Do     Sol   Re
But Your love never fails


         Do            Mim              
You make  all things  work together
