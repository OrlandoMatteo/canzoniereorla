Better stop dreaming of the quiet life,
                Mim7
'cause it's the one we'll never know
    Fa#m7
And quit running for that runaway bus
             Mim7
'cause those rosy days are few
    Sol                      Fa#m7
And stop apologizing for the things you've never done
       La
'Cause time is short and life is cruel

but it's up to us to change

This town called malice

Fa#m7
Rows and rows of disused milk floats
      Mim7
stand dying in the dairy yard
      Fa#m7
And a hundred lonely housewives clutch
     Mim7
empty milk bottles to their hearts
Sol                               Fa#m7
Hanging out their old love letters on the line to dry
      La
It's enough to make you stop believing

when tears come fast and furious
                 Re
In a town called malice, yeah

Fa#m7
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Mim7
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Fa#m7
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Mim7
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

Sol                      Fa#m7
 Struggle after struggle, year after year
    La
The atmosphere's a fine blend of ice,

I'm almost stone cold dead
                 Re
In a town called malice, ooh yeah

  Do#                      Sim7
A whole street's belief in Sunday's roast beef
     Do#m               Sim7
Gets dashed against the Co-op
          La
To either cut down on beer or the kid's new gear

       La7                              Re
It's a big decision in a town called malice, ooh yeah

Fa#m7                        Mim7
 The ghost of a steam train, echoes down my track
Fam7
 It's at the moment bound for nowhere
Mim7
Just going round and round, oh
Sol
Playground kids and creaking swings
Fa#m7
 Lost laughter in the breeze
  La
I could go on for hours and I probably will

But I'd sooner put some joy back
