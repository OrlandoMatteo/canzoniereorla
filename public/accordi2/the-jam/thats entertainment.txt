La#                 Solm7
 A police car and a screamin' siren
La#                  Solm7
 Pneumatic drill and ripped-up concrete
La#                Solm7
 A baby wailing, a stray dog howling
La#                        Solm7
 The screech of brakes and lamplight blinking
Dom7        Sol#
That's entertainment
Dom7        Sol#     La#  Solm7
That's entertainment

La#                       Solm7
 A smash of glass and the rumble of boots
La#                      Solm7
 An electric train and a ripped-up phone booth
La#                             Solm7
 Paint-splattered walls and the cry of a tomcat
La#                     Solm7
 Lights going out and a kick in the balls
      Dom7        Sol#
I say that's entertainment
Dom7        Sol#       La#
That's entertainment
Solm7           La#
La la la la la, ah
Solm7           La#
La la la la la, ah

                  Solm7
Days of speed and slow-time Mondays
La#                          Solm7
 Pissing down with rain on a boring Wednesday
La#                          Solm7
 Watching the news and not eating your tea
La#                        Solm7
 A freezing cold flat with damp on the walls
      Dom7        Sol#
I say that's entertainment
Dom7        Sol#     La#  Solm7
That's entertainment

La#                       Solm7
 Waking up at 6 A.M. on a cool warm morning
La#                      Solm7
 Opening the windows and breathing in petrol
La#                              Solm7
 An amateur band rehearsing in a nearby yard
La#                     Solm7
 Watching the telly and thinking 'bout your holidays
Dom7        Sol#
That's entertainment
Dom7        Sol#      La#

La la la la la

La#                            Solm7
 Waking up from bad dreams and smoking cigarettes
La#                       Solm7
 Cuddling a warm girl and smelling stale perfume
La#                     Solm7
 A hot summer's day and sticky black tarmac
La#                            Solm7
 Feeding ducks in the park and wishing you were far away
Dom7        Sol#
That's entertainment
Dom7        Sol#      La#  Solm7
That's entertainment

La#                         Solm7
 Two lovers kissing masks a scream of midnight
La#                         Solm7
 Two lovers missing the tranquility of solitude
La#                Solm7
 Getting a cab and travelling on buses
La#                         Solm7
 Reading the grafitti about slashed-seat affairs
Dom7        Sol#
That's entertainment
Dom7        Sol#      La#
That's entertainment...
