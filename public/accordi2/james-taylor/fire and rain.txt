[<pre>La Sol Re La  La Mi Sol  La


               Mim                  Re             La   Lasus2 La
Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone 
            Mi                      Sol
Susanne the plans they made put an end to you 
  La               Mim            Re               La   Lasus2 La
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song 
               Mi             Sol          Sol Re
I just can't remember who to send it to 



Re         Sim                 La   Lasus2 La
I've seen fire and I've seen rain 
          Re                 Sim                  La  Lasus2 La
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end 
          Re                   Sim               La      Lasus2 La
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend 
      Sol                       Mim       La   La7
But I always thought that I'd see you again 



          La                  Mim
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
              Re              La    Lasus2 La
You've got to help me make a stand 
                   Mi               Sol
You've just got to see me through another day 
La         Mim            Re          La   Lasus2 La
My body's aching and my time is at hand 
            Mi           Sol         Sol Re
And I won't make it any other way 



Re             Sim                 La   Lasus2 La
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain 
          Re                 Sim                  La  Lasus2 La
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end 
          Re                   Sim               La      Lasus2 La
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend 
      Sol                       Mim       La   La7
But I always thought that I'd see you again 



     La                     Mim            Re                       La  Lasus2 La
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun 
                    Mi                     Sol
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around 
              La                    Mim                Re                    La  Lasus2 La
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come 
                 Mi                  Sol                    Sol Re 
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground 



Re             Sim                 La   Lasus2 La
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain 
          Re                 Sim                  La  Lasus2 La
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end 
          Re                   Sim               La      Lasus2 La
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend 
      Sol                       Mim                            La   La7
But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again 



            Sol                Mim    La
Thought I'd see you one more time again 
               Sol                    Mim             La
There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now 
            Sol                    Mim               La
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you fire and rain, now . . .</pre>]
