La#m
(Turn around)

Every now and then
        Sol#
I get a little bit lonely

And you're never coming round
La#m
(Turn around)

Every now and then
        Sol#
I get a little bit tired

Of listening to the sound of my tears
Do#
(Turn around)

Every now and then
        Si
I get a little bit nervous

That the best of all the years have gone by
Do#
(Turn around)
                           Si
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified

And then I see the look in your eyes

Mi            La
(Turn around, bright eyes)

Every now and then I fall apart
Mi            La
(Turn around, bright eyes)

Every now and then  I fall apart

La#m
(Turn around)

Every now and then
        Sol#
I get a little bit restless

And I dream of something wild
La#m
(Turn around)

Every now and then
        Sol#
I get a little bit helpless

And I'm lying like a child in your arms
Do#
(Turn around)

Every now and then
        Si
I get a little bit angry

And I know I've got to get out and cry
Do#
(Turn around)

Every now and then
        Si
I get a little bit terrified

But then I see the look in your eyes

Mi            La
(Turn around, bright eyes)

Every now and then

I fall apart
Mi           La
Turn around, bright eyes

Every now and then

        Sol#
I fall apart
      Fam            Do#
And I need you now tonight
      Re#                Sol#
And I need you more than ever
           Fam          Do#
And if you only hold me tight
         Re#          Sol#
We'll be holding on forever
          Fam               Do#
And we'll only be making it right
             Re#
'Cause we'll never be wrong
  Do#/Fa                       Re#/Sol
Together we can take it to the end of the line
     Fam                         La#
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time

(all of the time)
  Sol#                           Re#/Sol
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
      Fam                        La#
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
                    Sol#/Do
I really need you tonight
  Re#/La#       Sol#/Do  Do#
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time I was falling in love
    Do                    Do#    Sol#/Do
But now I'm only falling apart
        La#m7
There's nothing I can do
  Re#                  Sol#   Fam  Do#  Re#
A total eclipse of the heart
Sol#                        Fam
Once upon a time there was light in my life
    Do                           Do#   Sol#/Do
But now there's only love in the dark

Nothing I can say
