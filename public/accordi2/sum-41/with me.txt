       Mi  Si4  Do#m7  Laadd9

Mi                 Si4   Do#m7     Laadd9
 I don't want this moment  to ever end,
Mi                  Si4       Do#m7 Laadd9
 Where everything's nothing without you
Mi               Si4          Do#m7        Laadd9
 I'd wait here forever just to, to see you smile,
            Mi         Si4       Do#m7 Laadd9
'Cause it's true, I am nothing without you
           Do#m7               Laadd9
Through it all, I've made my mistakes
              Mi                     Si4
I stumble and fall, but I mean these words

              Do#m
I want you to know,
     La                          Mi
With everything I won't let this go
Si              Sol#/Do      Do#m
These words are my heart and soul
          La                     Mi
I'll hold on to this moment, you know,
   Si         Sol#/Do      Do#m
As I bleed my heart out to show,
      La        Mi
And I won't let go

Mi  Si4  Do#m7  Laadd9

Mi                Si4   Do#m7        Laadd9
 Thoughts read, unspoken, forever in vow,
Mi             Si4           Do#m7  Laadd9
 And pieces of memories fall to the ground
Mi             Si4            Do#m7              Laadd9
 I know what I didn't have, so  I won't let this go,
            Mi         Si4       Do#m7 Laadd9
'Cause it's true, I am nothing without you
        Do#m                     Laadd9
All the streets, where I walked alone,
                Mi                  Si
With nowhere to go, have come to an end

              Do#m
I want you to know,
     La                          Mi
With everything I won't let this go
Si              Sol#/Do      Do#m
These words are my heart and soul
          La                     Mi
I'll hold on to this moment, you know,
   Si         Sol#/Do      Do#m
As I bleed my heart out to show,
      La        Mi
And I won't let go

La                Mi                      Si
 In front of your eyes, it falls from the skies,
               Do#m             Si         La
When you don't know what you're looking to find
                 Mi                      Si
In front of your eyes, it falls from the skies,
              Do#m       Si            La  Mi  Si  Do#m Si
When you just never know what you will find

La  Mi  Si  Do#m Si Mi
