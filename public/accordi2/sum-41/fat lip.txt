Mi   Re La    Mi   Re La

Mi   Re La    Mi   Re La

Mi
Storming through the party
                Si
like my name is El Ni√±o
         La
When I'm hanging out drinking

in the back of el camino
     Mi
As a kid was a skid
                      Si
and no one knew me by name
             La
I crashed my own house party cuz nobody came
      Mi
And I know I'm not the one you thought you

knew back In high school
Do#m
Never going never showing
La
up whenever we had to
      Mi
The attention that we crave

don't tell us to behave
    Do#m
I'm sick of always
                 La
hearing act your age


I don't wanna
Mi    Si Do#m
waste my time

Become another
Sol#m La    Sol#m  La
casualty of soci--ety
           Mi   Si Do#m
I'll never fall in line
               Sol#m
Become another victim
La         Sol#m La
of your conformity
         Mi Re  Mi Re  Mi Re  Mi Re
And back down


Be... Cause... You.... Don't
Mi
Know us at all
                  Si
We laugh when old people fall
    La
But what would you expect

with a conscience so small
      Mi
Heavy metal and mullets
               Si
is how we were raised
La
Maiden and Priest were

the gods that we praised
    Mi
And we like having fun at

other peoples expense and
Do#m
Cutting people down
          La
is just a minor offence
         Mi
And it's none of your concern

I guess I'll never learn
    Do#m
I'm sick of being
                La
told to wait my turn


I don't wanna
Mi    Si Do#m
waste my time

Become another
Sol#m La    Sol#m  La
casualty of soci--ety
           Mi   Si Do#m
I'll never fall in line
               Sol#m
Become another victim
La         Sol#m La
of your conformity
         Mi       La Mi
And back down

Mi      Si/Re#    Do#m
  Don't count on me
   La
To let you know when
Mi      Si/Re#    Do#m
  Don't count on me
     La
I'll do it again
Mi      Si        Do#m7
  Don't count on me
         La
It's the point your missing
Mi      Si        Do#m7
  Don't count on me
    La
Cuz I'm not listening

           Re Mi
Well I'm a no goodnick
      Re     Mi    La
lower middle class brat
     Re     Mi
Back packed and I dont
       Re    Mi   La
give a shit about nothing

You be standing on the corner

talking on that kuffufin
        Re    Mi
But you don't make sense
             Re      Mi La
from all the gas you be huffing
       Re  Mi
If the ink don't stain
          Re      Mi       La
you'll be ringing off the hook
            Re  Mi
Your on the hit list wanted
       Re  Mi    La
in the telephone book
       Re    Mi
I like songs with distortion
   Re    Mi    La
to drink in proportion

The doctor said my mom
                            Re
should've had an abortion...


I don't wanna
Mi    Si Do#m
waste my time

Become another
Sol#m La    Sol#m  La
casualty of soci--ety
           Mi   Si Do#m
I'll never fall in line
               Sol#m
Become another victim
La         Sol#m La
of your conformity back down
Mi    Si Do#m
Waste my time with them
Sol#m La    Sol#m La
Casualty in socie-ty
Mi    Si Do#m
Waste my time with them
Sol#m  La         Sol#m La
Victim of your conformity
         Mi    Re La Mi   Re La Mi
And back down

Re La Mi   Re La Mi
