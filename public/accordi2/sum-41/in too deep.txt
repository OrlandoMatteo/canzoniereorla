    Mi
The faster we're falling
      La
We're stopping and stalling
      Mi                   La
We're running in circles again
        Mi
Just as things were looking up
            La
You said it wasn't good enough
    Mi                            La
But still, we're trying one more time
Mi                           La
Maybe we're just trying too hard
                   Mi                   La
When really, it's closer than it is too far

           Mi     La            Mi        La
'Cause I'm in too deep, and I'm trying to keep
     Mi         La      Mi            La
Up above in my head, instead of going under
           Mi     La             Mi        La

Mi                       Sol#m
Seems like each time I'm with you
La
I lose my mind
            Mi                     Sol#m La
Because I'm bending over backwards to  relate
     Mi
It's one thing to complain
    Sol#m       La
But when you're driving me insane
              Mi                           Sol#m La
Well, then, I think it's time that we took a   break
Mi                          La

Instead of going under

Mi Fa#m7     La       Si      Mi
 I can't sit back and wonder why
   Fa#m7   La       Si       Mi
It took so long for this to die
      Fa#m7  La        Si    Mi
And I hate it when you fake it
          Fa#m7        La              Si
You can't hide it, you might as well embrace it
Mi     Fa#m7    La        Si   Mi
 So believe me,  it's not easy
   Fa#m7      La
It seems that something's telling me
