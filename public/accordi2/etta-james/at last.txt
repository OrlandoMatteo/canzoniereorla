At  last
Solm7  Do7#9        Fa    Rem7
    My love has come along
Solm7   Dom7   Do7  Fa       Rem7
     My lonely days   are over
Solm7   Do7            Fa    Fa7/Re# Re7b9 Do#7
    And life is like a song
Solm7/Do Do9
Oh yeah yeah
Fa       Rem7
At last
Solm7   Do7#9         Fa    Rem7
   The skies above are blue
Solm7   Dom7    Do7         Fa       Rem7
     My heart was wrapped up in clover
Solm7        Do7       Fa     La#6  Famaj9
   The night I looked at you

               Solm11
I found a dream
Do7               Faadd9
   That I could speak to
Fa6             Mi7  Fa7
   A dream that I
Mi7        Lam7     Do6
   Can call my own
             Rem11
I found a thrill
Sol7           Domaj7
   To press my cheek to
Do#dim           Rem11  Sol7
   A thrill that I
           Do7
Have never known

Oh yeah yeah

    Fa      Rem7
You smiled, you smiled
Solm7       Do7#9       Fa       Rem7
   Oh and then the spell was cast
Solm7     Dom7   Do7  Fa         Rem7
   And here we are    in heaven
Solm7              Do9
   For you are mine...
