        La  Sim7    La

La                        Sim7
 Something told me it was over
                      La
When I saw you and her talking
                           Sim7
Something deep down in my soul said, 'Cry, girl'
                            La
When I saw you and that girl walkin' out
                                          Sim7
Whoo, I would rather, I would rather go blind, boy,
                                   La
Than to see you walk away from me, child, no
                                     Sim7
Whoo, so you see, I love you so much

That I don't wanna watch you leave me, baby
                                        La
Most of all, I just don't, I just don't wanna be free, no
                                  Sim7
Whoo, whoo, I was just, I was just, I was just
                                                   La
Sitting here thinkin' of your kiss and your warm embrace, yeah
                                           Sim7
When the reflection in the glass that I held to my lips now, baby,
                               La
Revealed the tears that was on my face, yeah
                                                Sim7
Whoo, and baby, baby, I'd rather, I'd rather be blind, boy
                                                  La
Than to see you walk away, see you walk away from me, yeah
                                      Sim7
Whoo, baby, baby, baby, I'd rather be blind boy

Baby, baby, baby...
