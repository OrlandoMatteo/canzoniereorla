Sol#m          Sol#m6             Fa#
 My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why
      Si     Fa#/La# Sol#m
I got out of bed at all
            Sol#m6            Fa#
the morning rain clouds up my window
    Si      Fa#/La# Sol#m
and I can't see at all
         Sol#m6         Fa#
And even if I could it'd all be grey,
         Si      Fa#/La# Sol#m
but your picture on my  wall
    Sol#m6             Sol#m
it reminds me that it's not so bad
     Sol#m6     Sol#m  Sol#m6  Sol#m  Sol#m6
it's not so bad

Sol#m         Sol#m6             Fa#
 I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
   Si        Fa#/La#  Sol#m
my head just feels in pain
             Sol#m6             Fa#
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
    Si       Fa#/La# Sol#m
I'm late for work  again
          Sol#m6
and even if I'm there,
        Fa#              Si        Fa#/La#  Sol#m
they'll all imply that I might not last the day
             Sol#m6          Sol#m
and then you call me and it's not so bad
     Sol#m6
it's not so bad and

Si  Si/Re#  Mi                    Mi/Fa#
I   want to thank you for giving me
    Si       Si/Re# Mi    Mi/Fa#
the best day of  my life
Si  Si/Re#   Mi             Fa#
Oh   just to be with you is having
    Re#m7          Do#m7
the best day of my life...

Si  Si/Re# Mi  Mi/Fa# Si  Si/Re# Mi  Mi/Fa#

Re#m7  Do#m7  Si

                   Si/Re#   Mi
Push the door, I'm home at last
                Mi/Fa#      Si
and I'm soaking through and through
                Si/Re# Mi
then you handed me a  towel
          Mi/Fa# Si
and all I see is you
               Si/Re#      Mi
and even if my house falls down now,
           Fa#     Re#m7
I wouldn't have a clue
               Do#m7
because you're near me and

Si  Si/Re#  Mi                    Mi/Fa#
I   want to thank you for giving me
    Si       Si/Re# Mi    Mi/Fa#
the best day of  my life
Si  Si/Re#   Mi             Fa#
Oh   just to be with you is having
    Re#m7          Do#m7
the best day of my life...
