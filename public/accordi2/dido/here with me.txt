       Sol    Sim

          Sol
I didn't hear you leave
                        Sim
I wonder how am I still here
                    Sol
And I don't want to move a thing
                 Sim
It might change my memory
     Mim9
Oh I am what I am

I'll do what I want
    Fa#m9
But I can't hide

        Sol
I won't go
        Solmaj7
I won't sleep
        Re
I can't breathe
             Remaj7
Until you're resting here with me
 Sim
I won't leave I can't hide
         La4
I cannot be
             La
Until you're resting here with me

Sol   Sim

                Sol
I don't want to call my friends
                             Sim
They might wake me from this dream
            Sol
And I can't leave this bed
                           Sim
Risk forgetting all that's been
     Mim9
Oh I am what I am

I'll do what I want
    Fa#m9
But I can't hide

        Sol
I won't go
      Solmaj7
I won't sleep
        Re
I can't breathe
             Remaj7
Until you're resting here with me
 Sim
I won't leave I can't hide
         La4
I cannot be
             La
Until you're resting here

I won't go

I won't sleep
        Re
