       Fa    Lam

Rem
I know you think that I shouldn't still love you,
   Lam
Or tell you that
       Rem
But if I didn't say it, well I'd still have felt it
Lam
Where's the sense in that?
          Do
I promise I'm not trying to make your life harder
     Solm                   Lam
Or return to where we were

La#                        Fa
 But I will go down with this ship
            Solm                   Rem
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
              La#                  Fa
There will be no white flag above my door
       Do             Solm
I'm in love and always will be

Rem
I know I left too much mess and destruction
        Lam
To come back again
             Rem
And I caused nothing but trouble
                          Lam
I understand if you can't talk to me again
Do
 And if you live by the rules of "it's over"
         Solm                        Lam
Then I'm sure that that makes sense

La#                        Fa
 But I will go down with this ship
            Solm                   Rem
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
              La#                  Fa
There will be no white flag above my door
       Do           Solm
I'm in love and always will be
            Fa
And when we meet

Which I'm sure we will
             Lam
All that was there

Will be there still
            Solm7
I'll let it pass

And hold my tongue
             Do4
And you will think
                 Do
That I've moved on....

La#                        Fa
 But I will go down with this ship
            Solm                   Rem
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
              La#                  Fa
There will be no white flag above my door
       Do            Solm
I'm in love and always will be
La#                        Fa
 But I will go down with this ship
            Solm                   Rem
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
              La#                  Fa
There will be no white flag above my door
       Do            Solm
I'm in love and always will be
La#                     Fa
 I will go down with this ship
            Solm                   Rem
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
              La#                  Fa
There will be no white flag above my door
       Do             Solm
I'm in love and always will be
