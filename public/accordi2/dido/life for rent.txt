  Dom                                          Sol#
I haven't ever really found a place that I call home
  Dom                                     Sol#
I never stick around quite long enough to make it
   Dom                            Sol#
I apologize once again I'm not in love
                     Dom
But it's not as if I mind
                              Sol#
that your heart ain't exactly breaking
            Fam             La#7
It's just a thought, only a thought

          Re# La#  Sol#            Re#   La#      Sol# La#7
But if my life  is for rent and I don't learn to buy
         Re#           La#        Sol#   La#7
Well I deserve nothing more than I get
            Re#  La#        Sol#
Cos nothing I have is truly mine

     Dom
I've always thought
                                 Sol#
that I would love to live by the sea
   Dom
To travel the world alone
              Sol#
and live more simply
       Dom                             Sol#
I have no idea what's happened to that dream
            Dom                         Sol#
Cos there's really nothing left here to stop me
            Fam             La#7
It's just a thought, only a thought

While my heart is a shield and I won't let it down
         Re#            La#       Fam        La#
While I am so afraid to fail so I won't even try
             Fam        La#
Well how can I say I'm alive
