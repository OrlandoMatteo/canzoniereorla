Sol                 Doadd9     Sol
 Amazing grace how sweet the sound
     Sol                   Re  
 That saved a wretch like me
  Sol                  Doadd9   Sol
 I once was lost, but now I'm found
    Sol         Re     Sol
 Was blind but now I see


      Sol                    Doadd9    Sol
 â€™Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
    Sol               Re      
 And grace my fears relieved;
    Sol        Sol/Si      Doadd9  Sol
 How precious did that grace appear,
    Sol      Re       Sol       Doadd9 Sol
 The hour I first believed!

  
              Doadd9               Sol
 My chains are gone, I've been set free.
           Doadd9                Sol
 My God, My Saviour has ransomed me.
           Doadd9           Sol/Si
 And like a flood his mercy reigns.
          Lam7   Re       Sol     Re Sol Re
 Un-ending love, amazing grace


    Sol                 Doadd9   Sol
 The Lord has promised good to me,
    Sol               Re           
 His word my hope secures;
   Sol       Sol/Si        Doadd9   Sol
 He will my shield and portion be,
           Re      Sol     Doadd9 Sol
 As long as life endures.

 My chains are gone, I've been set free.
           Doadd9                Sol

 The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
    Sol              Re
 The sun forbear to shine;
    Sol                  Doadd9  Sol
 But God, who called me here below,
    Sol      Re    Sol     Doadd9 Sol 
 Will be forever mine.
    Sol      Re    Sol     Doadd9 Sol 
(Will be forever mine)
    Sol      Re    Sol     
(You are forever mine)</pre>]
