       Lam9  Fa  Sol  Lam9

       Lam9  Fa  Sol  Lam9

Lam9
 Here comes the rain again
Fa
Falling on my head like a memory
Sol                                   Lam9
Falling on my head like a new emotion

I want to walk in the open wind
Fa
 I want to talk like lovers do
  Sol
I want to dive into your ocean
      Lam9
Is it raining with you
        Fa
So baby talk to me
     Do
Like lovers do
Fa
Walk with me
     Do
Like lovers do
Fa
Talk to me
     Do          Re  Sol
Like lovers do

Lam9
 Here comes the rain again
Fa
Raining in my head like a tragedy
Sol                                 Lam9
Tearing me apart like a new emotion

Oooooh

I want to breathe in the open wind
Fa
 I want to kiss like lovers do
  Sol
I want to dive into your ocean
      Lam9
Is it raining with you
        Fa
So baby talk to me
     Do
Like lovers do
Fa
talk to me
     Do
Like lovers do
Fa
talk to me
     Do        Re  Sol
Like lovers do

Mim  Fa  Lam     Mim  Fa  Sol

        Fa
So baby talk to me
     Do        Re  Sol
Like lovers do

Lam9  Fa  Sol  Lam9

Lam9  Fa  Sol  Lam9

Lam9
 Here comes the rain again
Fa
Falling on my head like a memory
Sol
Falling on my head like a new emotion
 Lam9
(Here it comes again, here it comes again)

I want to walk in the open wind
Fa
 I want to talk like lovers do
  Sol
I want to dive into your ocean
      Lam9
Is it raining with you

Lam9
 Here comes the rain again

Falling on my head like a memory

Falling on my head like a new emotion...
