        Fa  Sol  Re#6  Rem7 Do

                             Rem7    Sol
No-one on earth could feel like this
                          Lam       Fa
I'm thrown and overblown with bliss
                       Sol
There must be an angel
             Re#6    Rem7  Do
Playing with my heart
                   Rem7    Sol
I walk into an empty room
                        Lam         Fa
And suddenly my heart goes "boom"!
                         Sol
It's an orchestra of angels
                         Re#6   Rem7  Do
And they're playing with my heart

Fa                             Sol#
  Must be talking to an angel
                            Do
Must be talking to an angel

Must be talking to an angel
Fa                             Sol#
  Must be talking to an angel
                            Do
Must be talking to an angel

Must be talking to an angel
Fa                             Sol#
  Must be talking to an angel
                            Do
Must be talking to an angel
                            Lam
Must be talking to an angel
Fa                            Sol
  Must be talking to an angel
                            Re#6
Must be talking to an angel
                            Do
Must be talking to an angel

                             Rem7    Sol
No-one on earth could feel like this
                           Lam     Sol Fa
I'm thrown and overblown with bliss
                       Sol
There must be an angel
              Re#6  Rem7 Do
Playing with my heart
                        Rem7     Sol
And when I think that I'm alone
                              Lam    Fa
It seems there's more of us at home
                           Sol
It's a multitude of angels
                          Re#6  Rem7 Do
And they're playing with my heart

Fa                             Sol#
  Must be talking to an angel
                            Do
Must be talking to an angel
                            Lam
Must be talking to an angel
Fa                            Sol
  Must be talking to an angel
                            Re#6
Must be talking to an angel
                            Do
Must be talking to an angel

La#            Re7
 I must be hallucinating
Solm
Watching angels celebrating
La#             Re7
 Could this be reactivating
Solm
All my senses dislocating?
La#             Re7
 This must be a strange deception
Solm
By celestial intervention
Do7
 Leavin' me the recollection
   Fa          Sol
Of your heavenly connection

And suddenly my heart goes "boom"!
