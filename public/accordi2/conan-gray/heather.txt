Do                                    Mim
I still remember, third of December, me in your sweater
                             Lam
You said it looked better on me than it did you
                  Famaj7
Only if you knew, how much I liked you
    Fam
But I watch your eyes as she
 
 
Do
Walks by
                 Mim                         Lam
What a sight for sore eyes, brighter than a blue sky
                 Famaj7         Fam
She's got you mesmerized while I die
 
 
Do
Why would you ever kiss me?
    Mim
I'm not even half as pretty
    Lam
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
    Famaj7
But you like her better
Fam
Wish I were Heather
 
 
Do
Watch as she stands with her, holding your hand
         Mim
Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder
    Lam
But how could I hate her? She's such an angel
Famaj7                 Fam
But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she

Ooh,         Wish I were Heather
