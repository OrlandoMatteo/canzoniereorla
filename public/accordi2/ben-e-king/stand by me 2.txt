[<pre>La    Fa#m   Re  Mi  La

             La
When the night has come
Fa#m
  And the land is dark
            Re         Mi                 La
And the moon is the only light we'll see
          La
No, I won't be afraid,
      Fa#m
No, I won't be afraid
            Re            Mi             La
Just as long as you stand, stand by me.

                      La
So, darling, darling, stand by me,
    Fa#m
Oh, stand by me.
    Re     Mi            La
Oh, stand, stand by me,
Stand by me.

         La
If the sky that we look upon
Fa#m
Should tumble and fall
            Re         Mi                 La
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea,
          La
I won't cry, I won't cry,
      Fa#m
No, I won't shed a tear
            Re            Mi             La
Just as long as you stand, stand by me.

                      La
And darling, darling, stand by me,
    Fa#m
Oh, stand by me.
     Re        Mi            La
Oh, stand now, stand by me,
Stand by me.

                      La
So, darling, darling, stand by me,
    Fa#m
Oh, stand by me.
     Re               Mi
Oh, stand now, stand by me,
      La
Stand by me.

                                     La                 Fa#m
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me, oh, stand by me

Oh, stand now, oh, stand, stand by me</pre>]
