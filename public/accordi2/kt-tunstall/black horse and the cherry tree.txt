       Mim  Si7  Mim  Si7 Mim

Well my heart knows me better than i know myself,
                                       Mim  Si7  Mim
so im gonna let it do all the talking

sent it away to the middle of nowhere,
                                         Mim  Si7  Mim
with a big black horse and a cherry tree

fell in fear upon my back, i said dont look back,
                      Mim  Si7  Mim
just keep on walking

but the little ole horse he looked this way and said,
                            Mim  Si7  Mim

       Mim Re      Domaj7
i said no, no, no, no, no, no
       Mim Re     Domaj7                Mim
i said no, no, you're not the one for me
           Re      Domaj7

       Mim Re                         Mim

well my heart had a problem in the early hours,
                                       Mim  Si7 Mim
so i stopped it dead for a beat or two

but i cut some cord and i shouldnt of done that,
                                            Mim  Si7  Mim
and it wont forgive me after all these years

i sent it away to the middle of nowhere,
                                         Mim  Si7  Mim
with a big black horse and a cherry tree

it wont come back cos its oh so happy,
                                            Mim  Si7  Mim
and now ive got a hole for the world to see
