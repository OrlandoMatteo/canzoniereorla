       Lam    Fa  Do

       Lam    Fa  Do

Lam
 You killed the love that was once so strong

With no regret to what you did wrong
         Fa
Should I stay and fight?
       Do
Can we make this right?
Lam
 You looked through me like an open door

Do I exist to you anymore?
Fa
 Cause when I'm talking to you
                                    Do
There's someone else that you're hearing
Lam
I gave you all the love I had

And I almost gave you one more chance
     Sol     Fa
Then you put one in the chamber
            Do
And shot my heart of glass
                            Lam
This time will be the last

Lam
 You played your game, used me like a pawn

Check mate you're done and then you were gone
      Fa
Did I move too fast?
          Do            Lam
I thought we would last

Now that you're through I can feel your soul

Where there was love lies an empty hole
Fa
 Cause when I make love to you
                              Do
It's someone else that you're feeling
Lam
I gave you all the love I had

And I almost gave you one more chance
     Sol     Fa
Then you put one in the chamber
            Do
And shot my heart of glass

This time will be the last
Lam
I gave you all the love I had

And I almost gave you one more chance
     Sol     Fa
Then you put one in the chamber
            Do
And shot my heart of glass

This time will be the last

Lam              Fa  Do
 So many nights
                          Sol   Lam
I've been standing at the wall
                  Fa         Do
Blind folded with cigarette
                Sol
Waiting for the fall

Lam    Fa  Do

Lam
I gave you all the love I had

And I almost gave you one more chance
     Sol     Fa
Then you put one in the chamber
            Do
And shot my heart of glass

This time will be the last
Lam
I gave you all the love I had

And I almost gave you one more chance
     Sol     Fa
Then you put one in the chamber
            Do
And shot my heart of glass
                             Lam
This time will be the last
