       Fa Lam Sol  Fa Lam Sol

Lam                 Sol
Dig if you will the picture
                          Lam
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
                       Sol
The sweat of your body covers me

Can you my darling
Mi6     Mi7
Can you picture this?
Lam                 Sol
Dream if you can a courtyard
                       Lam
An ocean of violets in bloom
               Sol
Animals strike curious poses

They feel the heat
    Mi6          Mi7    Lam
The heat between me and you

Lam                       Sol
How can you just leave me standing?
                           Lam
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
                     Sol
Maybe I'm just too demanding
                       Mi6    Mi7
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold
Lam                       Sol
Maybe you're just like my mother
                 Lam
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
                         Sol
Why do we scream at each other

This is what it sounds like
Mi6    Mi7
 When doves cry

Fa Lam Sol   Fa Lam Sol

Fa Lam Sol   Fa Lam Sol

Fa Lam Sol   Fa Lam Sol

Fa Lam Sol   Fa Lam Sol

Lam                  Sol
Touch if you will my stomach
                       Lam
Feel how it trembles inside
                      Sol
You've got the butterflies all tied up

Don't make me chase you
Mi6  Mi7
Even doves have pride

Lam                       Sol
How can you just leave me standing?
                           Lam
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
                     Sol
Maybe I'm just too demanding
                       Mi
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold
Lam                       Sol
Maybe you're just like my mother
                 Lam
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
                         Sol
Why do we scream at each other

This is what it sounds like
Mi6   Mi7
 When doves cry

Fa Lam Sol   Fa Lam Sol

How can you just leave me standing?
