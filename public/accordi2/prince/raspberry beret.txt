      La           Sol       Fa#m7
I was working part time in a five-and-dime,
   Sol                Re Sol La
My boss was Mr. McGee
                   Sol           Fa#m7
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind,
       Sol                    Re Sol La
'Cause I was a bit 2 leisurely
                 Sol        Fa#m7
Seems that I was busy doing something close 2 nothing,
    Sol                            Re Sol La
But different than the day before
              Sol      Fa#m7
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
           Sol
She walked in through the out door (out door)

           La  Sol      Re/Fa#
She wore a Raspberry beret
    Sol                Re   Sol  La
The kind U find in a second hand store
    Sol      Re/Fa#
Raspberry beret
    Sol                              Re   La
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
    Sol      Re/Fa#
Raspberry beret
          Mi   La
I think I love her

La             Sol         Fa#m7
Built like she was, uh, she had the nerve 2 ask me
     Sol                       Re Sol La
If I planned 2 do her any harm

So, look here,
                      Sol               Fa#m7
I put her on the back of my bike and-a we went riding
Sol                             Re Sol La
Down by old man Johnson's farm
                     Sol        Fa#m7
I said now, overcast days never turned me on
    Sol                                    Re Sol La
But something about the clouds and her mixed
           Sol         Fa#m7
She wasn't 2 bright but I could tell
                Sol
When she kissed me

She knew how 2 get her kicks

Re       La/Do#         Re               La/Do#
The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof,
Re
 And the horses wonder who U are
Re             La/Do#                 Re   La/Do#
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
  Re
U feel like a movie star
        Sol        Fa#m           Mi
Listen,  they say the first time ain't the greatest
           Re
But I tell ya, if I had the chance 2 do it all again
  Sol                             Fa#m
I wouldn't change a stroke 'cause baby I'm the most,
       Mi
With a girl as fine as she was then
