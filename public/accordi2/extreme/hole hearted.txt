Life's ambition occupies my time
                       Do#
Priorities confuse the mind
Sol#
Happiness one step behind
                             Do#
This inner peace I've yet to find
       Sol#/Do#  Fa#/Do# Do#
Rivers flow   into the  sea
    Sol#      Fa#/Sol#              Sol#
Yet even the sea is not so full of me
   Do#     Sol#/Do#   Fa#/Do# Do#
If I'm not blind why can't I see
       Sol#          Fa#/Sol#      Sol#
That a circle can't fit where a square should be
          Fa#
There's a hole in my heart
         Siadd9            Do# Re#/Do# Do# Re#/Do#
That can only be filled by you
         Fa#
And this hole in my heart
          Si9                      Do# Re#/Do#
Can't be  filled with the things I do

Hole hearted

This heart of stone is where I hide
                               Do#
These feet of clay kept warm inside
Sol#
Day by day less satisfied
                       Do#
Not fade away before I die
       Sol#/Do#  Fa#/Do# Do#
Rivers flow   into the  sea
    Sol#      Fa#/Sol#              Sol#
Yet even the sea is not so full of me
   Do#     Sol#/Do#   Fa#/Do# Do#
If I'm not blind why can't I see
       Sol#          Fa#/Sol#      Sol#

There's a hole in my heart

That can only be filled by you

Should have known from the start
         Si9                     Do# Re#/Do#
I'd fall short with the things I do
     Mi6     Re#      Do#  Re#/Do#
Hole hearted     Hole Hearted

Hole hearted     Hole Hearted
