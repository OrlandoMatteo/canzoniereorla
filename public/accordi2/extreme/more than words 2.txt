Sol          Doadd9
Saying I love you is
Lam7             Do       Re         Sol
not the words I want to hear from you
Sol                Doadd9
It's not that I want you
Lam7            Do      Re    Mim
not to say but if you only knew
   Sim7   Lam7
Ho-ow ea-sy
Re              Sol      Re/Fa#     Mim
It would be to show me how you feel
Sim7       Lam7       Re7              Sol7
More than words  is all you have to do
Sol7         Do
To make it real
Do         Dom              Sol
Then you wouldn't have to say
          Mim7
That you love me 'cos
Lam7    Re7   Sol
I'd already know


Sol              Re/Fa#   Mim          Sim      Do
What would you do if my heart was torn in two
Do                    Sol/Si    Lam7            Re7              Sol
More than words to show you feel that your love for me is real
Sol              Re/Fa#     Mim7        Sim7    Do
What would you say if I took those words away?
Do                     Sol/Si      Lam7
Then you couldn't make things new
         Re7           Sol
Just by saying I love you

Sol             Doadd9
Now that I've tried to 
Lam7             Do        Re     Sol
Talk to you and make you understand
Sol            Doadd9
All that you have to do is
Lam7            Do               Re          Mim
Close your eyes and just reach out your hands
    Sim7   Lam7
And touch me
Re                   Sol    Re/Fa#   Mim
Hold me close don't ever let me go
        Sim7  Lam7
More than words
Re7           Sol7                 Do
Is all I ever needed you to show
Do        Dom                   Sol
Then you wouldn't have to say
          Mim7
That you love me 'cos
Lam7   Re7    Sol
I'd already know


Sol              Re/Fa#     Mim        Sim      Do
What would you do if my heart was torn in two
Do                   Sol/Si     Lam7             Re7                Sol
More than words to show you feel that your love for me is real
Sol              Re/Fa#     Mim7        Sim7    Do
What would you say if I took those words away?
Do                     Sol/Si      Lam7
Then you couldn't make things new
        Re7            Sol
Just by saying I love you</pre>]
