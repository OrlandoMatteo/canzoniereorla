Oh yes, I'm the Great   Pretender,
   Do               Sol   Sol7
Pretending I'm doing well
   Do      Re         Sol      Do   Do#dim
My need is such, I pretend too much,
   Sol/Re       Re7     Sol
I'm lonely but no one can tell

Oh yes, I'm the great  pretender,
  Do                     Sol   Sol7
Adrift in a world  of my own
  Do       Re           Sol     Do   Do#dim
I play the game, but to my real shame
       Sol/Re     Re7        Sol
You've left me to dream all alone

    Do                      Sol
Too real is this feeling of make believe,
   Do           Lam7 Re7    Sol       Re7
Too real when I feel  what my heart can't conceal

   Sol         Lam7  Re7  Sol  Sol7
Oh yes, I'm the great  pretender
     Do                    Sol    Sol7
Just laughing and gay like a clown
 Do      Re            Sol      Do    Do#dim
I seem to be, what I'm not, you see,
    Sol/Re     Re          Si     Do  Do#dim
I'm wearing my heart like a crown,
   Sol/Re       Re7     Sol          Sol7
Pretending that you're still around
