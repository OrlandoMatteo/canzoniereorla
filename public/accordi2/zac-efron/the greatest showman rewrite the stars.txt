[<pre>Zac Efron
Sol
You know I want you
Sol
It's not a secret I try to hide
Sol
I know you want me
                          Sol        Do
So don't keep saying our hands are tied
Re/Fa#                     Mim
You claim it's not in the cards
                        Do
But fate is pulling you miles away
                      Re/Fa#
And out of reach from me
                      Mim
But you're here in my heart
                      Do
So who can stop me if I decide

That you're my destiny?


Zac Efron
            Mim          Do
What if we rewrite the stars?
             Sol          Re/Fa#
Say you were made to be mine
              Mim      Do
Nothing could keep us apart
             Sol                 Re/Fa#
You'd be the one I was meant to find
            Mim                Do
It's up to you, and it's up to me
            Sol              Re/Fa#
No one can say what we get to be
                 Mim         Do
So why don't we rewrite the stars?
           Sol             Re/Fa#
Maybe the world could be ours
    Sol
Tonight


Zendaya
Sol
You think it's easy
Sol
You think I don't want to run to you
Sol
But there are mountains
Sol
And there are doors that we can't walk through
Re/Fa#                    Mim
I know you're wondering why
                      Do
Because we're able to be

Just you and me
             Re/Fa#
Within these walls
                  Mim
But when we go outside
                         Do            
You're gonna wake up and see that it was 
               Re
hopeless after all


Zendaya
             Mim       Do
No one can rewrite the stars
            Sol            Re/Fa#
How can you say you'll be mine?
            Mim     Do
Everything keeps us apart
                Sol                 Re/Fa#
And I'm not the one you were meant to find
                Mim
It's not up to you
              Do
It's not up to me
              Sol                   Re/Fa#
When everyone tells us what we can be
            Mim         Do
How can we rewrite the stars?
             Sol          Re/Fa#
Say that the world can be ours

Tonight


Zac Efron and Zendaya
Mim              Do          Sol
All I want is to fly with you
                Re/Fa#       Mim
All I want is to fall with you
                Sim      Do
So just give me all of you

(Zendaya)
Do
It feels impossible
(Zac Efron)
Do
It's not impossible
(Zendaya)
Do
Is it impossible?
(Both)
              Do
Say that it's possible


Zac Efron and Zendaya
            Mim       Do
How do we rewrite the stars?
             Sol         Re/Fa#
Say you were made to be mine?
            Mim     Do
Nothing can keep us apart
                  Sol              Re/Fa#
Cause you are the one I was meant to find
            Mim
It's up to you
              Do
And it's up to me
           Sol                Re/Fa#
No one can say what we get to be
                  Mim         Do
And why don't we rewrite the stars?
              Sol        Re/Fa#
Changing the world to be ours

Zendaya
Sol
You know I want you
Sol
It's not a secret I try to hide
Sol
But I can't have you
Sol
We're bound to break and
Sol
My hands are tied</pre>]
