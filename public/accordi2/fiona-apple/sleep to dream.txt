 I tell you how I feel

But you don't care

I say tell me the truth

But you don't dare

You say love is a hell

You cannot bear

And I say gimme mine

Back and then go there

For all I care

Do
 I got my feet
       La#7
On the ground
            La7
And I don't go to

Sleep to dream
Do              La#7
 You got your head

In the clouds
            La7
And you're not at

All what you seem
Do
 This mind, this body
         La#7
And this voice cannot be
                  La7         Do
Stifled by your deviant ways
                       La#7
So don't forget what I told you

Don't come around
        La7                Solm
I got my own hell to raise

Solm
I have never been

So insulted in all my life

I could swallow the seas

To wash down all this pride

First you run like a fool

Just to be at my side

And now you run like a fool

But you just run to hide

And I can't abide

Do
 I got my feet
       La#7
On the ground
            La7
And I don't go to

Sleep to dream
Do              La#7
 You got your head

In the clouds
            La7
And you're not at

All what you seem
Do
 This mind, this body
         La#7
And this voice cannot be
                  La7         Do
Stifled by your deviant ways
                       La#7
So don't forget what I told you

Don't come around
        La7
I got my own hell to raise
Do7              Sol#
 Don't make it a big deal
          Re7
Don't be so sensitive

We're not playing
  La#7
A game anymore

You don't have
       Sol#7          Solm
To be so defensive

          Solm
Don't you plead me your case

Don't bother to explain

Don't even show me your face

'Cause it's a crying shame

Just go back to the rock

From under which you came

Take the sorrow you gave

And all the stakes you claim

And don't forget the blame

Do
 I got my feet
       La#7
On the ground

And I don't go
   La7
To sleep to dream
Do
 You got your head
       La#7
In the clouds and
               La7
You're not at all

What you seem
Do
 This mind, this body
         La#7
And this voice cannot be
        La7
Stifled by your deviant ways
Do
 So don't forget
       La#7
What I told you

Don't come around
       La7
I got my own hell to raise
Do
 I got my feet
       La#7
On the ground
            La7
And I don't go to

Sleep to dream
Do              La#7
 You got your head

In the clouds
            La7
And you're not at

All what you seem
Do
 This mind, this body
         La#7
And this voice cannot be
                  La7         Do
Stifled by your deviant ways
                       La#7
So don't forget what I told you

Don't come around
        La7
I got my own hell to raise...

Do  La#7  La7     Do  La#7  La7
