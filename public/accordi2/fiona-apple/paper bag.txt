      Mi             Do        Sol           Sim7
I was staring at the sky, just looking for a star
   Mi7         Do          Sol             Si7
To pray on, or wish on, or something like that
      Mi              Do      Sol            Sim7
I was having a sweet fix of a daydream of a boy
      Fa        Mim         La7
Whose reality I knew, was a hopeless to be had
           Mi         Do            Sol       Sim7
But then the dove of hope began its downward slope
        Mi                    Do
And I believed for a moment that my chances
    Sol                Si7
Were approaching to be grabbed
          Mi           Do          Sol    Fa
But as it came down near, so did a weary tear
  Mim              La7              Do9
I thought it was a bird, but it was just a paper bag

       Sol          Domaj7       Fa          Sol
Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh it kills
                    Domaj7          Fa
'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up
         Sol               Domaj7         Fa        Sol
I got to fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold
     Mim7               La7
Hunger hurts, but starving works,
        Fa7add6             Sol    Si7#9
when it costs too much to love

Mi           Do    Sol
 And I went crazy again today,
 Sim7          Mi
looking for a strand to climb
Do            Sol         Si7
Looking for a little hope
Mi  Do           Sol
    Baby said he couldn't stay,
Sim7             Fa
wouldn't put his lips to mine,
      Mim7              La7
And a fail to kiss is a fail to cope
         Mi             Do           Sol
I said, 'Honey, I don't feel so good,
              Sim7
don't feel justified
Mi            Do          Sol         Si7
Come on put a little love here in my void,' he said
      Mi          Do                       Sol
'It's all in your head,' and I said, 'So's everything'
              Fa       Mim7             La7
But he didn't get it I thought he was a man
           Do9
But he was just a little boy

       Sol          Domaj7       Fa          Sol
Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh it kills
                    Domaj7          Fa
'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up
         Sol               Domaj7         Fa        Sol
I got to fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold
       Mim7                La7
Hunger hurts, but starving works,
        Fa7add6             Sol
when it costs too much to love
       Domaj7                     Fa         Sol
Hunger hurts, but I want him so bad, oh it kills
                    Domaj7          Fa

         Sol               Domaj7         Fa        Sol
