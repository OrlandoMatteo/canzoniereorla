Lam                  Fa7
 I've been a bad, bad girl
Lam                        Fa7
 I've been careless with a delicate man
Lam               Fa7
 And it's a sad sad world
Lam                           Fa7
 When a girl will break a boy just because she can
Do         La#7            Fa7
 Don't you tell me to deny it
          Do                  La#          Lam
I've done wrong and I want to suffer for my sins
Do              La#             Sol#7           Sol
 I've come to you 'cause I need guidance to be true
           Fa7                      Sol#
And I just don't know where I can begin

Fa7               Dom7
 What I need is a good defense
           Fa7                Dom7
'Cause I'm feeling like a criminal
      Fa7
And I need to be redeemed
       Dom7              La#
To the one I've sinned against
             Sol#   Sol7         Fa7
Because he's all I ever knew of love

Lam                     Fa7
 Heaven help me for the way I am
Lam                             Fa7
Save me from these evil deeds before I get them done
Lam                         Fa7
 I know tomorrow brings the consequence at hand
    Lam                             Fa7
But I keep living this day like the next will never come
   Do                La#7            Fa7
Oh help me but don't tell me to deny it
            Do                La#
I've got to cleanse myself of all these lies 'till
    Lam
I'm good enough for him
Do          La#
 I've got a lot to lose
        Sol#                 Sol
and I'm bettin' high so I'm begging you
  Fa7                                  Sol#
Before it ends just tell me where to begin

Fa7               Dom7
 What I need is a good defense
           Fa7                Dom7
'Cause I'm feeling like a criminal
      Fa7
And I need to be redeemed
       Dom7              La#
To the one I've sinned against
             Sol#   Sol7         Fa7
Because he's all I ever knew of love

Dom7

Re#     Si
 Let me know the way
Sol#             Si
 Before there's hell to pay
Re#      Si              Sol#7
 Give me room to lay the law and let me go
Re#          Si
 I've got to make a play
Sol#         Si
 To make my lover stay
Re#               Si            Sol#7
 So what would an angel say the devil wants to know

Fa7               Dom7
 What I need is a good defense
           Fa7                Dom7
'Cause I'm feeling like a criminal
      Fa7
And I need to be redeemed
       Dom7              La#
To the one I've sinned against
             Sol#   Sol7         Fa7     Dom7
Because he's all I ever knew of love
