      Fa#m  Sim7  Mi  Lamaj7  Re  Do#7


Fa#m          Sim7
 The moment I wake up
             Mi    Lamaj7
Before I put on my makeup
  Re                       Do#7
I say a little prayer for you
Fa#m              Sim7
 While combing my hair, now,
                   Mi       Lamaj7
And wondering what dress to wear, now,
  Re                      Do#7
I say a little prayer for you

  Re         Mi          Do#m        Fa#m
Forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart
           La7
And I will love you
  Re        Mi       Do#m       Fa#m
Forever, forever, we never will part
             La7
Oh, how I'll love you
  Re        Mi             Do#m         Fa#m
Together, together, that's how it must be
           La7
To live without you
      Re                     Do#7
Would only be heartbreak for me

Fa#m           Sim7
 I run for the bus, dear,
               Mi       Lamaj7
While riding I think of us, dear,
  Re                      Do#7
I say a little prayer for you
Fa#m            Sim7
 At work I just take time
                   Mi     Lamaj7
And all through my coffee break-time,
  Re                      Do#7
I say a little prayer for you

  Re       Mi            Do#m        Fa#m
Forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart
           La7
And I will love you
  Re       Mi       Do#m        Fa#m
Forever, forever we never will part
             La
Oh, how I'll love you
  Re         Mi            Do#m        Fa#m
Together, together, that's how it must be
          La7
To live without you
      Re      Re/Mi          Do#7
Would only be heartbreak for me

  Re       Mi            Do#m       Fa#m
Forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart
           La7
And I will love you
  Re       Mi       Do#m       Fa#m
Forever, forever we never will part
             La7
Oh, how I'll love you
  Re         Mi            Do#m        Fa#m
Together, together, that's how it must be
          La7
To live without you
      Re      Re/Mi          Do#7
Would only be heartbreak for me

Fa#m          Sim7
