           La
There’s a girl from Brazil
                         Mi7
She was born to move her hips, can’t keep her 
feet still
                                             
Always looking for attention she uses eyes to 
  La
turn a small flame into a fire
         La
She’s a girl from a town
                        Mi7
When nobody knows your name, when nobody’s found
           Mi7
And no one ever sees the bright lights now as she 
spends every night
     La
She dance her way to a better life


         Rem                 La
I gotta leave cause it's a bad thing
           Mi7                             Fa
She bouta make me do the things that she wanna do
             Rem              La
It feels so good, when is a bad thing
              Mi7                                
But when the lights go down come on, Elita, wave 
       La
your crown


                       Mi7
And the crowd shouts Elita
                          La
Oh come up, where we can see ya
                        Mi7
Now the night is ready for ya
                        La
One dance and we'll be singing hallelujah
                          Mi7
Now the crowd they are screaming
                          La
Let it up, what they are feeling
                            Mi7
It's so hot, don't get too near
           La
No. 1 señorita, oh Elita


            La
It’s kinda hard to find somebody from this part 
of the world
              Mi7
Until you're looking at her body and you're 
starting to tell
             Mi7
That you’re falling in love and it feels like a 
drug
            La
You’ve got nothing to lose, you’ve got something 
to touch
            La
She can be cold, cold digging for gold
             Mi7
She doesn't want to keep a man, doesn't want to 
be sold
           Mi7
She had a ticket to a life that is hard to resist
     La
She rewrote the book and added a twist


         Rem                 La
I gotta leave cause it's a bad thing  (it's a 
bad thing)
           Mi7                             Fa
She bouta make me do the things that she wanna do
             Rem              La
It feels so good, when is a bad thing  (it's a 
bad thing)
              Mi7                                 
But when the lights go down come on, Elita, wave 
      La
your crown


                       Mi7
And the crowd shouts Elita (Elita)
                          La

ya)
                        Mi7

She’ll fight for her right, she’ll whatever 
    La

                       Mi7
And the crowd shouts Elita (Elita!)
