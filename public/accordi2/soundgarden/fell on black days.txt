Mim  Sim         Lam      Mim Sim     Do
 Whatsoever I've feared has   come to light
Mim        Sim       Lam      Mim Sim     Do   Mim
 And whatsoever I've fought off became my life
Sim       Lam   Mim  Sim      Do              Mim
Just when every day seemed to greet me with a smile
Sim           Lam
Sunspots have faded
    Mim     Sim   Do
And now I'm doing time
Mim     Sim   Do
Now I'm doing time

 Whomsoever I've cured
     Sim      Do
I've sickened now
Mim      Sim         Lam   Mim
 And whomsoever I've cradled
     Sim     Do  Mim
I've put you down
      Sim          Lam       Mim
I'm a search light soul they say
    Sim     Do            Mim
But I can't see it in the night
Sim      Lam    Mim    Sim    Do
I'm only faking when I get it right
Mim    Sim    Do
When I get it right
