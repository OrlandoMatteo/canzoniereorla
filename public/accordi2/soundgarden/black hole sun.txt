In my eyes, indisposed
      Famaj7            Mim
in disguise as no one knows
          Re#            Re7sus4
hides the face, lies the snake
    Sol    Fa    Sol#
the sun in my disgrace
        Sol6         Solm/La#
Boiling heat, summer stench
            Famaj7                Mim
beneath the black the sky looks dead
        Re#              Re7sus4
call my name through the cream
         Sol       Fa      Sol#
and I'll hear you, scream again

           Re#            Re7
Black hole sun, won't you come
    Sol   Fa      La#add9
And wash away the rain?
           Re#            Re7
Black hole sun, won't you come?
          Doadd9          Re7
Won't you come? won't you come?

      Sol6           Solm/La#
Stuttering, cold and damp,
          Famaj7            Mim
Steal the warm wind tired friend.
          Re#             Re7sus4
Times are gone for honest men, and sometimes,
Sol     Fa       Sol#
Far too long for snakes.

      Sol6             Solm/La#
In my shoes, a walking sleep,
       Famaj7            Mim
And my youth I pray to keep.
       Re#       Re7sus4
Heaven send Hell away,
       Sol        Fa     Sol#
No one sings like you anymore.

           Re#            Re7
Black hole sun, won't you come
