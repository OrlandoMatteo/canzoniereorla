     Sol
When all the tears are rolling down your face

And it feels like yours was the only heart to break

When you come back home and all the lights are out, ooh

And you getting used to no one else being around
Mim  Do         Sol
Oh, oh, I'll be there

          Sol
When it's Friday night and the drink don't work the same

You're alone with yourself and there's no one else to blame

When you still can't feel the rhythm of your heart

And you see your spirit fading in the dark
