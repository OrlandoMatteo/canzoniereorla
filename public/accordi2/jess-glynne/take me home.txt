        Fa#m  Re  La  Mi

  Fa#m          Re
    Wrapped up, so consumed by
  La         Mi
    All this hurt
  Fa#m     Re
    If you ask me, don't
  La              Mi
    Know where to start
  Fa#m7     Re
    Anger, love, confusion
    La               Mi
    Roads that go nowhere
  Fa#m                       Re
    I know there's somewhere better
                   La        Mi
    Cause you always take me there
  Sim11
    Came to you with a broken faith
  Fa#m7
    Gave me more than a hand to hold
  La
    Caught before I hit the ground
  Mi7sus4
    Tell me I'm safe, you've got me now

  La                    Sim7
    Would you take the wheel
                  Fa#m
    If I lose control?
                  Re
    If I'm lying here
                      La
    Will you take me home?
                    Sim7
    Could you take care
                 Fa#m
    Of a broken soul?
                      Re
    Will you hold me now?

    Will you take me home?

  Fa#m           Re
    Hold the gun to my head
         La     Mi
    Count 1, 2, 3
  Fa#m             Re
    If it helps me walk away then it's
  La       Mi
    What I need
  Fa#m7               Re
    Every minute gets easier
               La        Mi
    The more you talk to me
  Fa#m                 Re
    You rationalize my darkest thoughts
