       Sol#m La#m Si
                                                       Si  Do#
I came here with a broken heart that no one else could see
  Re#m                    Fa#           Sol#m La#m
I drew a smile on my face to paper over me
Si                                                  Si  Do#
But wounds heal and tears dry and cracks they don't show
Re#m                               Fa#  Sol#m La#m
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
Si
Let's go back to simplicity
                 Si     Do#
I feel like I've been missing me
Re#m
Was not who I'm supposed to be
Fa#                   Sol#m La#m
I felt this darkness over me
Si
We all get there eventually
                   Si   Do#
I never knew where I belonged
Re#m
But I was right and you were wrong
                    Sol#m La#m
Been telling myself all along

Simaj7                           Sol#m7
Don't be so hard on yourself, no
Re#m                            Do#  La#m7
Learn to forgive, learn to let go
Simaj7                         Sol#m7
Everyone trips, everyone falls
   Re#m                          Do#
So don't be so hard on yourself, no
           Simaj7                      Sol#m7
'Cause I'm just tired of marching on my own
        Re#m                Do#      Sol#m7
Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones
      La#m7  Simaj7                      Sol#m7
Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
   Re#m                          Do#    Sol#m7 La#m7
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

    Si                                                Si  Do#
I'm standin' on top of the world, right where I wanna be
Re#m                       Fa#             Sol#m La#m
So how can this dark cloud be raining over me
Si                                                 Si  Do#
But hearts break and hell's a place that everyone knows
Re#m                             Fa#  Sol#m La#m
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

Si
Let's go back to simplicity
                 Si     Do#

Simaj7                           Sol#m7
Don't be so hard on yourself, no
Re#m                            Do#  Sol#m7 La#m7
Learn to forgive, learn to let go
Simaj7                         Sol#m7
Everyone trips, everyone falls

Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
   Re#m                          Do#    Sol#m La#m Si
So don't be so hard on yourself, no

Sol#m          Sol#m La#m7 Re#m
Oh, oh, oh, I
                          Re#m Do#/Fa Fa#
I learned to wave goodbye
                       Fa# Sol#m7 Do#
How not to see my life
                            Do# Re#m Sol#m7
Through someone else's eyes
                      Sol#m La#m7 Re#m
It's not an easy road
                     Re#m Do#/Fa Fa#
But no I'm not alone
                 Fa# Sol#m7 Do#
So I, I won't be so         hard on myself no more

Simaj7                           Sol#m7
Don't be so hard on yourself, no
Re#m                            Do#  Sol#m7 La#m7
Learn to forgive, learn to let go
Simaj7                         Sol#m7
Everyone trips, everyone falls

Kind of frail, I feel it in my bones

Won't let my heart, my heart turn into stone
