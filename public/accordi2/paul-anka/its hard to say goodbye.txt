        Mim9
There's something in your eyes
                 Sim7
that's far too revealing
    Mim9                              Lam   Lam/Sol
Why must it be like this a love without feelin'
Famaj7                    Fa#m7b5 Si7/Re#
Something is wrong with you  I  know

     Do/Re     Re7
It's gonna be okay
  Mim9                               Sim7
I told you from the start I won't be demanding

I won't be demanding
       Mim9                              Lam

I'll be understanding
     Famaj7           Fa#m7b5 Si7/Re#
When love becomes a broken  heart
    Mim      Mim/Re  Do#m7b5
and dreams begin to die

I'll be the first to help you try

We've lost that loving touch we used to feel so much
  Mim9                             Lam
I try to hide the truth that's in my eyes
                 Lam/Sol
The love without feeling
         Famaj7         Fa#m7b5 Si7/Re#
