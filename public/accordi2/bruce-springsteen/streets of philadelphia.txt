        Fa   Lam   Fa   Lam

     Fa
I was bruised and battered I couldn't tell what I felt
     Lam
I was  unrecognizable to myself
      Fa
saw my  reflection in a window and didn't know my own face
                 Lam
oh brother are you gonna leave me wasting like this on the
            La#add9      Fa/La   Do
streets of Philadelphia

La#add9  Fa/La  Do

        Fa
I walked the avenue 'til my legs felt like stone
       Lam
I heard  voices of friends vanished and gone
          Fa
At night I  hear the blood in my veins
       Lam
just as  black and whispery as the rain on the
            La#add9       Fa/La  Do
streets of Philadelphia

La#add9  Fa/La  Do

 La#                          Rem
   Ain't no angel gonna greet me
 La#                         Fa
   It's just you and I my friend
 Lam                        La#        Do
   and my clothes don't fit me no more   I walked a

   thousand miles just to slip this skin

Fa
 The night is falling, I'm lying awake
     Lam
I can  feel my self fading away
    Fa
so receive me brother with your fateless kiss or
       Lam
will we  leave each other alone like this on the
            La#add9         Fa/La  Do
streets of Philadelphia...

La#add9  Fa/La  Do
