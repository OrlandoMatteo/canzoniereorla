You're all dressed up in blue

Honey I'm tougher than the rest

            Mim   Do
The road is dark
                Sol
And it's a thin thin line
                  Do
But I want you to know
                     Re  Sol
I'll walk it for you any time
                   Mim
Maybe your other boyfriends
                  Sol
Couldn't pass the test
                                   Do
Well if you're rough and ready for love
