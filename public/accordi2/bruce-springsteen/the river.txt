  Mim                     Sol              Re                   Do
I come from down in the valley   Where mister, when you're young
       Mim             Sol  Do               Sol
They bring you up to do like your daddy done
        Do                                 Sol           Re    Mim
Me and Mary we met in high school  When she was just seventeen
      Lam                                Sol                     Do
We'd drive out of this valley down to where the fields were green


         Mim          Do        Re                    Sol
We'd go down to the river And into the river we'd dive
    Mim          Do          Re  Do
Oh down to the river weâ€™d ride



    Mim                Sol       Re                      Do
Then I got Mary pregnant  And man, that was all she wrote
    Mim           Sol                      Do                  Sol
And for my 19th birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat
    Do                                    Sol           Re       Mim
We went down to the courthouse  And the judge put it all to rest
    Lam
No wedding day smiles, no walk down the aisle
     Sol                   Do
No flowers, no wedding dress


                   Mim          Do
That night we went down to the river
    Re                    Sol
And into the river we'd dive
    Mim          Do            Re   Do
Oh down to the river we did ride


 Mim   Sol    Re    Do  
 Mim   Sol    Do    Sol  
 Do    Do   Sol Re   Mim 
 Lam   Lam   Sol    Do  



  Mim                     Sol               Re               Do
I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company
     Mim                      Sol              Do                 Sol
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy
    Do
Now all them things that seemed so important
              Sol                 Re            Mim
Well mister they vanished right into the air
           Lam                               Sol                    Do
Now I just act like I don't remember   Mary acts like she don't care


         Mim                      Sol                       Re
But I remember us riding in my brother's car   Her body tan and wet down at
     Do               Mim                      Sol
the reservoir    At night on them banks I'd lie awake
               Do                      Sol
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
           Do
Now those memories come back to haunt me
      Sol        Re      Mim
They haunt me like a curse
       Lam                                    Sol                Do
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true    Or is it something worse


               Mim          Do                 Re                Sol
That sends me down to the river   Though I know the river is dry
               Mim          Do       Re   Do
That sends me down to the river tonight
 Mim          Do        Re       Sol
Down to the river my baby and I
    Mim          Do        Re  Do
Oh down to the river we ride     Ooh..
