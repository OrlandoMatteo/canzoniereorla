Out here the nights are long, the days are lonely
                                    Sol
I think of you and I'm working on a dream
                 Do
I'm working on a dream

Now the cards I've drawn's a rough hand, darling
                                           Sol
I straighten the back and I'm working on a dream

Rain pourin' down, I swing my hammer
                                     Sol
My hands are rough from working on a dream
