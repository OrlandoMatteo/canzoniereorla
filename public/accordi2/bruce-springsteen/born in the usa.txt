[<pre>Si
  Born down in a dead man's town
    Si
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground
Mi
End up like a dog that's been beat too much
         Mi
Till you spend half your life just covering up

Si                          Si
  Born in the U.S.A., I was   born in the U.S.A.
      Mi                    Mi
I was   born in the U.S.A.,   born in the U.S.A. now

Si
  Got in a little hometown jam
Si
  so they put a rifle in my hand
Mi
  Sent me off to a foreign land
Mi
  To go and kill the yellow man

Si                          Si
  Born in the U.S.A., I was   born in the U.S.A.
      Mi                    Mi
I was   born in the U.S.A.,   born in the U.S.A. now

Si
  Come back home to the refinery
       Si
Hiring man said "Son if it was up to me"
Mi
  Went down to see my V.A. man
        Mi
He said   "Son, don't you understand"


     Si  Si  Mi  Mi

Si
  I had a brother at Khe Sahn
Si
  Fighting off the Viet Cong
Mi
  They're still there, he's all gone


     Mi

Si
  He had a woman he loved in Saigon
Si
  I got a picture of him in her arms now


     Mi    Mi

Si
  Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
           Si
Out by the   gas fires of the refinery
    Mi
I'm   ten years burning down the road
Mi
  Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go

Si                          Si
  Born in the U.S.A., I was   born in the U.S.A.

I was   born in the U.S.A.,   born in the U.S.A. now

  Born in the U.S.A., I was   born in the U.S.A.

I was   born in the U.S.A.,   born in the U.S.A. now
