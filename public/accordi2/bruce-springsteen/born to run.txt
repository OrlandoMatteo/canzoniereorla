       Mi
In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a
La                 Si
runaway American dream
   Mi
At night we ride through mansions of glory in
La          Si
suicide  machines
La                   Sol#m            Fa#m                        Sol#m
Sprung from cages on Highway 9 chrome wheeled, fuel injected and, steppin'
             Mi   Mi9
out over the line Ohhh
La                      Sol#m
Baby this town rips the bones from your back,
       Fa#m               Sol#m
it's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
         Mi                  Do#m7
we gotta get out while we're young
       La
'Cause tramps like us
Si                   Mi   La/Mi  Si/Mi
baby we were born to run

Mi   La  Si

              Mi
Wendy, let me in, I wanna be your friend,
        La                    Si
I wanna guard your dreams and visions
     Mi
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims,
    La                         Si
And strap your hands across my engines
        La            Sol#m
And Together we could break this trap,
      Fa#m                  Sol#m             Mi
We'll run till we drop and, baby we'll never go back
Mi9         La                      Sol#m
Oh will you walk with me out on the wire?
       Fa#m                         Sol#m
'cause baby I'm just a scared and a lonely rider,
      Mi                Do#m7
But I gotta know how it feels,
          La
I want to know if love is wild, baby,
  Si                      Mi    La/Mi  Si/Mi
I want to know if love is real

Mi   La  Si

Sol4            Sol    Sol4  Sol
scream down the boulevard

Girls comb their hair in rear-view mirrors

The amusement park rises bold and stark

Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist

The highways jammed with broken heroes
     La                Si4   Si
On a last chance power drive
     Mi
everybody's out on the run tonight
            La               Si
But there's no place left to hide
  La                    Sol#m
Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness
     Fa#m                  Sol#m         Mi
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
Mi9  La                    Sol#m                  Fa#m
Oh   someday girl, I don't know when, we're gonna get to that place
         Sol#m        Mi
Where we really wanna go
                      Do#m7
And we'll walk in the sun
              La
but till then tramps like us
Si                   Mi   Do#m7  La
Baby we were born to run
Si                   Mi   Do#m7  La
Baby we were born to run
Si                   Mi   La Si   Mi   La Si Mi
Baby we were born to run
