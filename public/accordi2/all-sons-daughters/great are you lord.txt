You give life, You are love
          Mi
You bring light to the darkness

You give hope, You restore
       Mi
Every heart that is broken
Re Fa#m            Mi
  Great are You, Lord


          Re              Fa#m
It's Your breath in our lungs
      Mi
So we pour out our praise, we pour out our praise
          Re              Fa#m
It's Your breath in our lungs
      Mi            
So we pour out our praise to You only


La   Lasus2   Resus2   La


La        
All the earth will shout Your praise
Lasus
Our hearts will cry, these bones will sing
Resus2             La
Great are You, Lord
