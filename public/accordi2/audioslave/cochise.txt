            Mim
Well I been watchin'
While you been coughin'
I've been drinking life
While you've been nauseous
         Mim
And so I drink to health
While you kill yourself
And I got just one thing
That I can offer...

Go on and save yourself
                   Mi   Mim
and take it out on me..
                   Mim

               Mim
Well I'm not a martyr
I'm not a prophet
And I won't preach to you
But here's a caution
           Mim
You better understand
That I won't hold your hand
But if it helps you mend
Then I won't stop it

Si
Drown.. if you want..
And I'll see you in the bottom
Where you..
Mi
Crawl.. on my skin..
And put the blame on me
                    Re
So you don't feel a thing
