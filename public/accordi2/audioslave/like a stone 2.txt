     Lam  Sol  Mim7  Fa

     Lam  Sol  Mim7  Fa

     Lam    Sol
On a cobweb afternoon
   Mim7           Fa
In a room full of emptiness
     Lam     Sol
By a freeway I confess
      Mim7        Fa
I was lost in the pages
Lam       Sol
Of a book full of death
Mim7              Fa
Reading how we'll die alone
Lam                     Sol
And if we're good we'll lay to rest
Mim7        Fa
Anywhere we want to go

Lam     Do      Sol     Lam
In your house I long to be
Lam     Do   Sol   Lam
Room by room patiently
     Fa           Lam
I'll wait for you there
Sol    Lam        Fa           Lam
Like a stone I'll wait for you there
 Mi
Alone


     Lam  Sol  Mim7  Fa

      Lam      Sol
On my deathbed I will pray
       Mim7         Fa
To the gods and the angels
       Lam      Sol
Like a pagan to anyone
    Mim7            Fa
Who will take me to heaven
Lam        Sol
To a place I recall
Mim7           Fa
I was there so long ago
    Lam
The sky was bruised
    Sol
The wine was bled
    Mim7             Fa
And there you led me on

Lam     Do      Sol     Lam
In your house I long to be
Lam     Do   Sol   Lam
Room by room patiently
     Fa           Lam
I'll wait for you there
Sol    Lam        Fa           Lam
Like a stone I'll wait for you there
 Mi
Alone
 Mi
Alone


     Lam  Do  Sol  Lam

     Lam  Do  Sol  Lam

     Fa   Lam  Sol  Lam  Fa  Lam  Mi

    Fa   Do
And on I read
  Mi              Fa
Until the day was gone
      Fam      Re
And I sat in regret
   Mi                  Lam
Of all the things I've done
    Fa            Do
For all that I've blessed
    Mi            Fa
And all that I've wronged
   Fam             Re
In dreams until my death
       Mi
I will wonder on

Lam     Do      Sol     Lam
In your house I long to be
Lam     Do   Sol   Lam
Room by room patiently
     Fa           Lam
I'll wait for you there
Sol    Lam        Fa           Lam
Like a stone I'll wait for you there
 Mi
Alone
