Fa          Do      Sol     Lam
Pearls and swine bereft of me
Fa        Do       Sol      Lam
Long and weary my road has been

I was lost in the cities, alone in the hills

No sorrow or pity for leaving, I feel, yeah

 I am not your carpet ride – I am the sky---

Fa          Do          Sol      Lam
Friends and liars don't wait for me,

And still too close to you, I feel, yeah
