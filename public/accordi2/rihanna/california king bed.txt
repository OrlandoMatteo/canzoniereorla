 Chest to chest
Sol/Si        Dosus2
 Nose to nose
Sol/Si        Dosus2
 Palm to palm
        Sol           Re/Fa#
We were always just that close
Sol/Si         Dosus2
 Wrist to wrist
Sol/Si       Dosus2
 Toe to toe
Sol/Si               Dosus2                 Sol           Re/Fa#       
 Lips that just felt just like the inside of a rose
 
 
   Mim            Do               Mim   Do
So how come when I reach out my fingers
   Mim              Do                 Sol   Re
It feels like more than distance between us

        Sol          Re/Fa#
In this California king bed
          Mim               Do
We're ten thousand miles apart
          Sol           Re/Fa#            Mim                    
I've been California wishing on these stars for your heart
    Do
for me

Sol/Si       Dosus2
 Eye to eye
Sol/Si         Dosus2
 Cheek to cheek
Sol/Si        Dosus2
 Side by side
         Sol             Re/Fa#
You were sleeping next to me
Sol/Si       Dosus2
 Arm in arm
Sol/Si       Dosus2
 Dusk to dawn
        Sol/Si         Dosus2
With the curtains drawn
             Sol            Re/Fa#
And a little last nite on these sheets

 
   Mim            Do               Mim   Do
So how come when I reach out my fingers

Just when I felt like giving up on us
                                       Sol/Si
You turned around and gave me one last touch
                Do
That made everything feel better
Mim           Re
And even then my eyes got wetter
Do                                     
So confused wanna ask you if you love me
Do 
But I donâ€™t wanna seem so weak
Re/Fa#   Sol        Lam  Sol/Si      Do
Maybe I've been California dreaming
