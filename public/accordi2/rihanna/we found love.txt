[<pre>Lam               Fa
Yellow diamonds in the light 
Do                  Sol
And we're standing side by side 
Lam             Fa
As your shadow crosses mine 
Do                Sol        Lam   Fa
What it takes to come aliiiivvveee..

Do                        Sol             Lam   Fa
It's the way I'm feeling I just can't denyyyy 
Do                      Sol
But I've gotta let it go 


Lam                  Fa
We found love in a hopeless place 
Do                  Sol
We found love in a hopeless place 
Lam                 Fa
We found love in a hopeless place 
Do                  Sol
We found love in a hopeless place 


Lam               Fa
Shine a light through an open door 
Do                  Sol
Love and life I will divide 
Lam             Fa
Turn away cause I need you more 
Do                Sol        Lam   Fa
Feel the heartbeat in my mind 

Do                        Sol             Lam   Fa
It's the way I'm feeling I just can't denyyyy 
Do                      Sol
But I've gotta let it go 


Lam                  Fa
We found love in a hopeless place 
Do                  Sol
We found love in a hopeless place 
Lam                 Fa
We found love in a hopeless place 
Do                  Sol
We found love in a hopeless place</pre>]
