      It's unfortunate that when we feel a stone
       Sol#add9                            Do           Fam
We can roll ourselves over 'cause we're uncomfortable
   Sol#add9                  Do   Fam
Oh well, the devil makes us sin
        Sol#add9                   Do       Fam   Sol#add9
But we like it when we're spinning  in his grip

Love is like a sin, my love,
        Sol#add9               Do    Fam
For the ones that feel it the most
        Sol#add9                  Do    Fam
Look at her with her eyes like a flame
         Sol#add9                        Do      Fam     Sol#add9
She will love you like a fly will never love you again
