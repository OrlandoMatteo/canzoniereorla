  Mi            Si/Re#          Do#m           Do#m 
There are times when I just want to look at your 
    Do#m/Si  La
face
            Fa#m         Si
With the stars in the night
Mi            Si/Re#          Do#m             Do#m/Si 
There are times when I just want to feel you embrace
La
    Fa#m        Si       Si9/Do
On a cold night


  Do#m          Fa#
I just can’t believe that you are mine now.

Si La Sol#m Si7


           Mi       Sol#m     La
You were just a dream that I once knew
        Mi               Sol#m          La Sol#m Fa#m Si
I never thought I would be right for you
                Mi       Mi7        La
I just can’t compare you with anything in this world
      Sol#m   Do#m      Fa#m          Si          Mi
You’re all I need to be with forevermore

Mi           Si/Re#        Do#m          Do#m/Si     La
All those years, I’ve long to hold you in my arms
                 Fa#m       Si
I’ve been dreaming of you
Mi        Si/Re#              Do#m              
Every night, I’ve been watching all the stars 
  Do#m/Si     La
that fall down
         Fa#m           Si Si9/Do
Wishing you will be mine


  Do#m          Fa#
I just can’t believe that you are mine now.

You’re all I need to be with forevermore


Do          Sol/Si                    Mim    
Time and again, there are these changes 
Lam  Re      Sol
that we cannot end
    Mim       La              Re       Sol       Do
As sure as time keeps going on and on
     Lam              Re          Si     Mi
My love for you will be forevermore
