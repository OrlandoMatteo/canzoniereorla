       Do#m

Do#m
 She's into superstitions black cats and voodoo dolls

I feel a premonition that girl's gonna make me fall

She's into new sensations new kicks in the candle light

She's got a new addiction for every day and night
       Fa#m
She'll make you take your clothes off
       Sol#m
and go dancing in the rain
       La
She'll make you live her crazy life
           Si
but she'll take away your pain
       Sol#7
Like a bullet to your brain   Come on!

Do#m                     Si              Do#m
Upside, inside out she's living la vida loca
                               Si             Do#m
She'll push and pull you down, living la vida loca
                               Si               Do#m
Her lips are devil-red and her skin's the color mocha
                      Si             Do#m
She will wear you out living la vida loca

Come on!
Si             Do#m

She's living la vida loca

Do#m
 Woke up in New York City in a funky cheap hotel

She took my heart and she took my money

She must've slipped me a sleeping pill
    Fa#m
She never drinks the water
          Sol#m
Makes you order French Champagne
La
Once you've had a taste of her
       Si
You'll never be the same
             Sol#7
Yeah, she'll make you go insane  Alright
