[<pre>             Do
Do you ever feel like breaking down?
     Lam
Do you ever feel out of place?
   Fa
Like somehow you just don't belong,
  Sol
and no one understands you.
     Do
Do you ever wanna run away?
     Lam
Do you lock yourself in your room?
       Fa
With the radio on turned up so loud,
  Sol
and no one hears you screaming.


  Fa
No you don't know what its like
       Lam
When nothing feels alright
      Fa                                   Sol
You don't know what its like to be like me...


     Lam            Fa           Do               Sol                
To be hurt, to feel lost, to be left out in the dark
     Lam                 Fa                  Do                  Sol
To be kicked when you're down, to feel like you've been pushed around 
     Lam             Fa                   Do                 Sol 
To be on the edge of breaking down, when no one's there to save you
Rem                               
No you don't know what its like
F  -No Strings-            
Welcome to my life 
  

      Do
Do you wanna be somebody else?
       Lam
Are you sick of being so left out?
       Fa
Are you desperate to find something more,
Sol
before your life is over?
       Do
Are you stuck inside a world you hate?
       Lam
Are you sick of everyone around?
        Fa
With the big fake smiles and stupid lies,
     Sol
While deep inside your bleeding



Fa
No you don't know what its like
     Lam
When nothing feels alright
    Fa                                   Sol
You don't know what its like to be like me...

     Lam               Fa                  Do                  Sol
To be kicked when your down, to feel like you've been pushed around
     Lam             Fa                   Do                Sol
To be on the edge of breaking down, when no ones there to save you
Rem
No you don't know what its like
F -No Strings- C
Welcome to my life..


Fa     
No one ever lies straight to your face
  Lam
And no one ever stabs you in the back
Fa
You might think I'm happy 
      Do            Sol
But I'm not gonna be okay
Fa
Everybody always gave you what you wanted
  Lam
You never had to work it was always there
  Fa                                   Sol
You don't know what it's like what it's like..
Strum here
