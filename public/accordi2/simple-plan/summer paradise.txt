(Oh, Oh)
La
(Take me back, take me back)

(Oh yeah)
Sim                        Sol
(Back to summer paradise)


   Re
My heart is sinking
La              Sim
As I'm lifting up
                           Sol
Above the clouds away from you

      Re                 La
And I can't believe I'm leaving
     Sim                                Sol
Oh I don't kno-kno-know what I'm gonna do


   Sim     Sol
But someday
Re              La
I will find my way back
        Sim     Sol
To where your name
    Fa#7
Is written in the sand


Sol                       Re
Cause I remember every sunset
La                Sim      La  Sol
I remember every word you said
                    Re        La
We were never gonna say goodbye

Say la-ta-ta-ta-ta

Sol                  Re
Tell me how to get back to
La                 Sim      La   Sol
Back to summer paradise with you
La                      Sol         Re
And I'll be there in a heartbeat
  La
Oh-oh

I'll be there in a heartbeat

Oh-oh

   Re
My soul is broken
La
Streets are frozen
Sim                                  Sol
I can't stop these feelings melting through

    Re               La
And I'd give away a thousand days, oh
Sim                            Sol
Just to have another one with you

(What'd you say)


               Re
Well relax can wait
(Relax can wait)
                La
I'm crushing my ways
(Uh-huh)
               Sim
Playing in the sand
(Me and you)
             Fa#7
Holding your hand


Sol                       Re
Cause I remember every sunset
La                Sim     La  Sol

I'll be there in a heartbeat
La
Oh-oh


(Yeah - Oh)

       Re
I remember summer mornings
And summer evenings
 La
Now you're right next to me
And I am freezing
 Sim
Was it real?
Oh baby tell me, was I dreaming?
 Sol
How can you show me paradise,
When I'm leaving?

         Re
Now my heartbeat is sinking
Hope is shrinking
 La
When I try to speak no words
Lip-syncing
 Sim
Hope this is not just wishful thinking
 Sol
Tell me that you care
And I'll be there in a heartbeat

Sim   Sol
Someday
Re              La
I will find my way back
         Sim     Sol
To where your name
    Fa#7
Is written in the sand

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go)

Sol                   Re
I remember where we first kissed
La                   Sim      La   Sol
How I didn't wanna leave your lips
                         Re       La
And how I've never ever felt so high
