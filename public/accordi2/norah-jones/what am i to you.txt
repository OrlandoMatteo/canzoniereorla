       Do  Sol  Do  Sol

             Do    Sol/Si
What am I to you
               Lam    Do/Sol
Tell me darling true
                  Fa
To me you are the sea
                Sol
Vast as you can be
                        Do   Sol
And deep the shade of blue
              Do         Sol/Si
When you're feeling low
              Lam       Do/Sol
To whom else do you go
                 Fa
See I cry if you hurt
                     Sol
I'd give you my last shirt
                Do      Do7
Because I love you so

Fa    Re#6       Do    Mi7
If my sky should fall
               Lam
Would you even call
Do/Sol       Re7/Fa#
Opened up my heart
                Fa
I never want to part
                   Do     Sol
I'm giving you the ball

            Do            Sol/Si
When I look in your eyes
                  Lam      Do/Sol
I can feel the butterflies
                          Fa
I will love you when you're blue
                Sol
Tell me darlin' true
              Do    Sol
What am I to you

Do  Sol/Si  Lam  Do/Sol

Fa  Sol  Do  Do7

Fa              Re#6 Do         Mi7

                         Fa
Could you find a love in me
                        Sol
Could you carve me in a tree
                   Do          Lam
Don't fill my heart with lies
                     Re7
I will love you when you're blue
                Sol
Tell me darlin' true
             Do    Fa   Do
What am I to you
