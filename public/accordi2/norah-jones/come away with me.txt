        Do  Lam  Do  Lam

        Do  Lam  Do  Lam

Do     Lam                 Do   Lam
 Come away with me in the night
Do     Lam
 Come away with me
      Mim        Fa    Do    Sol
And I will write you a song
Do     Lam               Do   Lam
 Come away with me on a bus
Do     Lam                  Mim   Fa
 Come away where they can't tempt us
           Do     Sol
With their lies
          Faadd9        Do
I want to walk with you
                 Sol
On a cloudy day
                    Faadd9                  Do
In fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high
         Sol        Do
So won't you try to come

     Lam7                   Do
Come away with me and we'll kiss
     Lam7         Do
On a mountaintop
      Lam
Come away with me
    Mim        Fa          Do   Sol
And I'll never stop loving you

Do  Lam  Do  Lam  Do  Lam  Mim  Fa

Do  Sol  Do  Lam  Do  Lam  Do  Lam

Mim  Fa  Do

Sol            Faadd9           Do
 And I want to wake up with the rain
                        Sol
Falling on a tin roof
          Faadd9             Do
While I'm safe there in your arms
       Sol       Do
So all I ask is for you
         Lam7               Do     Lam7
To come away with me in the night
Do     Sol      Do
 Come away with me
