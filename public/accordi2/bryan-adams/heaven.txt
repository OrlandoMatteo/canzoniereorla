Do/Mi    Lam                    Sol
  Oh   thinking about our younger years
          Rem           Lam
There was only you and me
         La#                 Sol            Do
We were young and wild and free
     Lam                   Sol
Now nothing can take you away from me
           Rem               Lam
We've been down that road before
            La#     La#/La
But that's over now
            Sol
You keep me coming back for more


Fa           Sol          Lam
Baby you're all that I want
            Do                Fa
When you're lying here in my arms
Fa                Sol          Lam            Sol
I'm finding it's hard believe we're in heaven
    Fa       Sol          Lam
‘Cos love is all that I need
      Do                      Fa
And I found it there in your heart
    Fa         Sol      Lam              Sol
It isn't too hard to see we're in heaven


Do/Mi   Lam                       Sol
   Oh, once in your life, you find someone
         Rem                Lam
Who will turn your world around
          La#                      Sol    Do
Bring you up when you're feelin' down
     Lam                          Sol
Yeah, nothing can change what you mean to me
             Rem                Lam
OOh, There's lots that I could say
          La#        La#/La
But just hold me now
          Sol
‘Cos our love will light the way


Fa           Sol          Lam
Baby you're all that I want

I'm finding it's hard believe we're in heaven
    Fa       Sol          Lam
‘Cos love is all that I need
      Do                      Fa
And I found it there in your heart
    Fa         Sol      Lam              Sol
It isn't too hard to see we're in heaven


Rem                  Do/Mi    Fa
  I've been waiting for so long
     Fa        Sol   Lam
For something to arrive
                  Sol/Si
For love to come along
Do Rem                   Do/Mi      Fa
    Now our dreams are coming true
                              Do
Through the good times and the bad
              Sol4             Sol
