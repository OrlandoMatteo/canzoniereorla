Fa                    Lam                 Sol
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
Fa                    Lam                      Sol
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
Fa                         Lam                       Sol
I hope I don't run out of time, can someone call a referee?
             Fa             Lam         Sol
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
Fa                      Lam                        Sol
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
Fa                       Lam             Sol
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple hundred times
   Fa                 Lam                Sol
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem myself tonight
             Fa             Lam             Sol
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances


Fa       Lam                  Sol
  Is it too late now to say sorry?
         Fa           Lam               Sol
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Fa       Lam                  Sol
  Is it too late now to say sorry?
       Rem
Yeah I know that I let you down
   Fa                           Sol
Is it too late to say that I'm sorry now?

Fa                      Lam                        Sol
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
    Fa                         Lam                   Sol
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
Fa                    Lam                    Sol
I go, I go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
       Fa            Lam            Sol
Can we both say the words, say forget this?


Fa       Lam                  Sol
  Is it too late now to say sorry?
         Fa           Lam               Sol
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Fa       Lam                  Sol

Fa               Lam                 Sol 
   I'm not just tryna get you back on me
         Fa         Lam                 Sol
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Fa       Lam                  Sol
