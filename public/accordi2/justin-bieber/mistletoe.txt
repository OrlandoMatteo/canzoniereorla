it's the most beautiful time of the year, 
                                          Mim7
Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer, 
                                  Doadd9
I should be playing in the winter snow, 
                           Sol
But Ima be under the mistletoe.

Sol                             Re4
I don't wanna miss out on the holiday, 
                                 Mim7
But I can't stop staring at your face, 
                                  Doadd9
I should be playing in the winter snow, 
                           Sol

 With you, shawty with you,

With you, shawty with you, 
Mim7                 Doadd9
With you, under the mistletoe, yeah.


Sol                               Re4
Everyone's gathering around the fire, 
                              Mim7
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July, 
                                      Doadd9
I should be chillin' with my folks, I know, 
                            Sol
But Ima be under the mistletoe.

Word on the streets Santa's coming tonight, 
                                Mim7
Reindeer flying thru the sky so high, 
                             Doadd9
I should be making a list, I know, 
                           Sol
But Ima be under the mistletoe.

Hey love, the Wise Men followed a star, 
                      Mim7
The way I followed my heart,
       Doadd9 
And it led me to a miracle.
     Sol                     Re4
Aye love, don't you buy me nothing, 
                        Mim7    
'Cause I am feeling one thing, 
                Doadd9
Your lips on my lips, That's a Merry Merry Christmas.
