I used to believe
        Do                                Mim   Fa
We were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful
          Mim   Fa
Somethin' beautiful
          Lam
Sellin' a dream
          Do                            Mim   Fa
Smoke and mirrors keep us waitin' on a miracle
     Mim   Fa
On a miracle


     Fa
Say, go through the darkest of days
Lam
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Sol                              Rem
Never let you go, never let me down
    Fa    
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride
Lam
Driving the edge of a knife
Sol                              Rem
Never let you go, never let me down

Don't fall asleep
       Do                                 Mim   Fa
At the wheel, we've got a million miles ahead of us
       Mim   Fa
Miles ahead of us
            Lam
All that we need
     Do                            Mim  Fa
Is a rude awakening to know we're good enough
           Mim  Fa
Know we're good enough
