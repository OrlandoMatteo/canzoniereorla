For all the times that you rain on my parade
            Rem               Do        Sol/Si
And all the clubs you get in using my name
              Do                  Sol/Si         Lam
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
              Rem            Do           Sol/Si
You think I'm crying, on my own, well I ain't
                   Do           Sol/Si                  Lam
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
   Rem        Do                Sol/Si
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
                 Do        Sol/Si              Lam
And baby I'll be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
            Lam      Fa                Do
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
                 Lam          Fa               Do                Sol
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
          Lam  Fa            Sol
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own


             Do        Sol       Lam        Fa
Cause if you like the way you look that much

But when you told me that you hated my friends
         Rem               Do           Sol/Si
The only problem was with you and not them
          Do             Sol/Si            Lam
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
             Rem             Do            Sol/Si
And tried to make me forget where I came from
                   Do           Sol/Si              
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want

I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
