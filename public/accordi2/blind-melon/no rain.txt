Mi                         Re
All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
  La                         Sol      Mi      Mi7
I like watchin’ the puddles gather rain
    Mi                    Re
And all I can do is just pour some tea for two
    La                         Sol         Mi     Mi7
and speak my point of view but it’s not sane, It’s not sane

And I don’t understand why I sleep all day
      La                       Sol         Mi     Mi7 
And I start to complain that there’s no rain
    Mi                      Re 
And all I can do is read a book to stay awake
   La                           Sol           Mi 
It rips my life away, but it’s a great escape

escape, escape, escape
