Do#m
 Counting days, counting days
                         La      Mi
since my love up and got lost on me
Do#m
 And every breath that I've been taken
          Si6               La       Mi
since you left feels like a waste on me
Do#m                                           Si6
 I've been holding on to hope that you'll come back
             La        Mi
when you can find some peace
Do#m
 Cause every word that I've heard spoken
          Si4               La     Mi
since you left feels like a hollow street
La
 I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
Do#m                         Si
 But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
La                                         Do#m
 Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

Sol#m                           La Do#m
 There must be something in the wa-ter
                            Sol#m La
Cause everyday it's getting col---der
                    Si   Do#m
And if only I could hold you
                              Sol#m La
You'd keep my head from going un----der

Do#m                           Si
 Maybe I, maybe I'm just being blinded
       La       Mi     Do#m
by the brighter side

Of what we had because it's over,
           Si4               La     Mi    La
well there must be something in the tide

I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
Do#m
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
La                                        Do#m
 Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

Sol#m                           La Do#m
 There must be something in the wa-ter
                            Sol#m La
Cause everyday it's getting col---der
                    Si   Do#m
And if only I could hold you
                              Sol#m La
You'd keep my head from going un----der
                La Do#m
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooh
                Sol#m La
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooh
                Si Do#m
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooh
                Sol#m La
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooh

Fa#m
 It's your love I'm lost in
Mi
 Your love I'm lost in
Do#m
 Your love I'm lost in
        Sol#m
And I'm tired of being so exhausted
Fa#m
 Your love I'm lost in
Mi
 Your love I'm lost in
Do#m
 Your love I'm lost in
Sol#m                          La  Do#m
Even though I'm nothing to you now
                               Sol#m La
Even though I'm nothing to you now

Sol#m                           La Do#m
 There must be something in the wa-ter
                            Sol#m La
Cause everyday it's getting col---der
                    Si   Do#m
And if only I could hold you
                              Sol#m La
You'd keep my head from going un----der
                               La Do#m
There must be something in the wa-ter

Cause everyday it's getting col---der
                    Si   Do#m
And if only I could hold you
                              Sol#m La
You'd keep my head from going un----der

La Do#m    Sol#m La    Si Do#m    Sol#m La
