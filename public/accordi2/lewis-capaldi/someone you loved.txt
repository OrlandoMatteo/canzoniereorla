[<pre>Do   Sol   Lam  Fa

Do                          Sol                              Lam     Fa
  I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
Do                            Sol                        Lam     Fa
  This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
                     Do               Sol               Lam               Fa
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know, somebody to have, somebody to hold
              Do                      Sol
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
                Lam                                Fa
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain


                Do             Sol
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
                 Lam                         Fa
And you're not here to get me through it all
                  Do                          Sol
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
                    Lam                         Fa
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved


Do                            Sol                           Lam     Fa
   I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
Do                            Sol                           Lam     Fa
  This all or nothing way of lovin' got me sleepin' without you
                         Do                 Sol               
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal, somebody to have, 
Lam                          Fa
  just to know how it feels
              Do                      Sol
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
                Lam                             Fa
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape


               Do                Sol
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
                 Lam                        Fa
And you're not here to get me through it all
                  Do                          Sol
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
                    Lam                         Fa
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved


    Rem           Lam                  Sol
And I tend to close my eyes but it hurts sometimes
          Lam      Rem
I fall into your arms
         Lam                         Sol
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around


N.C.             Do                Sol
Now  the day bleeds into nightfall
                 Lam                        Fa
And you're not here to get me through it all
                  Do                          Sol
I let my guard down, and then you pulled the rug
                    Lam                         Fa
