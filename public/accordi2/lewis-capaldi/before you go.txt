Re
I fell by the wayside, like everyone else
Sim
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself
Sol
Our every moment, I start to replace
La4                              La
‘cause now that they’re gone all I hear are the words that I needed to say

When you hurt under the surface
Sim                            Sol
Like troubled water running cold
                            La4      La
Well time can heal but this won't

So

Before you go
               Sim
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
    Sol                             La
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather

So
           La
Before you go
              Sim
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
    Sol                                  
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless

Was never the right time, whenever you called
Sim
Went little by little by little, until there was nothing at all
Sol
Our every moment, I start to replay
La4                          La
When all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

Sim          Sol             Re
Would we be better off by now?
       La                 Sim
If I'd let my walls come down?
        Sol                  La
