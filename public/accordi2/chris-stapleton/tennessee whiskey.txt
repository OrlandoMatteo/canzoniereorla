[<pre> La                               Sim
Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Re               Sim               La   La Re La    
 Liquor was the only love I’ve known


 La                                       Sim
But you rescued me from reachin’ for the bottom
                Re        Sim             La   La Re La
And brought me back from being too far gone
 
   Mi        La
 You're as

            La    La Re La               Sim
You’re as smooth       as Tennessee whiskey
            Re  Sim                 La   La Re La
You’re as sweeeeet as strawberry wine
  Mi        La                  Sim
You’re as warm as a glass of brandy
                    Re             Sim           La   La Re La
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

   Mi     La


 La                                        Sim
I’ve looked for love in all the same old places
Re            Sim                            La  La Re La  
  Found the bottom of a bottle was always dry

   Mi        La

 La                                           Sim
But when you poured out your heart I didn’t waste it
                Re                 Sim             La     Mi
‘Cause there’s nothing like your love to get me high, yeah


            La    La Re La               Sim
You’re as smooth       as Tennessee whiskey
            Re  Sim                 La   La Re La
You’re as sweeeeet as strawberry wine
  Mi        La                  Sim
You’re as warm as a glass of brandy
                    Re             Sim           La   La Re La
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time


Mi  La    Sim   Re Sim   La   La Re La
Mi  La    Sim   Re Sim   La   Mi


 Mi          La    La Re La               Sim
You’re as smooth       as Tennessee whiskey
            Re  Sim                 La   La Re La
You’re as sweeeeet as strawberry wine
  Mi        La                  Sim
You’re as warm as a glass of brandy
                    Re             Sim           La   La Re La
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time


 Mi          La   La Re La               Sim
You’re as smooth      as Tennessee whiskey
               Re  Sim               La   La Re La
Tennessee whiskey,  Tennessee whiskey
 Mi          La    La Re La               Sim
You’re as smooth       as Tennessee whiskey
               Re    
Tennessee whiskey
Sim               La
