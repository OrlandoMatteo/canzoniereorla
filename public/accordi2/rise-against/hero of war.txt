[<pre>    Mi                      Sol#m
..."Son, have you seen the world?
                     La
Well, what would you say
                   Mi
If I said that you could?
                La
Just carry this gun,
                Mi
You'll even get paid.".
                           Si
I said "That sounds pretty good."


              Mi
Black leather boots,
                Sol#m
Spit-shined, so bright.
                La
They cut off my hair,
               Mi
But it looks alright.
                  La
We marched and we sang.
              Mi
We all became friends,
                     Si
As we learned how to fight.


          Do#m
A hero of war!
                       La
Yeah, that's what I'll be.
                Mi
And when I come home,
                         Si
They'll be damn proud of me.
                Do#m
I'll carry this flag;
                    La
To the  grave, if I must.
                          Mi
'Cause it's a flag that I love
                   Si
And it's flag that  I trust.


                Mi
I kicked in the door,
            Sol#m
I yelled my commands.
                   La
The children, they cried,
             Mi
But I got my man.
            La
We took him away,
               Mi
A bag over his face,
                        Si
From his family and his friends.


                  Mi
They took off his clothes,
                   Sol#m
They pissed in his hands.
               La
I told them to stop,
                   Mi
But then, I joined in.
                 La
We beat him with guns
                     Mi
And batons, not just once,
               Si
But again and again.


          Do#m
A hero of war!
                       La
Yeah, that's what I'll be.
                Mi
And when I come home,
                         Si
They'll be damn proud of me.
                Do#m
I'll carry this flag;
                    La
To the  grave, if I must.
                          Mi
'Cause it's a flag that I love
                   Si
And I flag that  I trust.


 She...


   Mi                          Sol#m
...walked through bullets and haze.
               La
I asked her to stop;
                Mi
I begged her to stay.
                La
But she pressed on,
               Mi
So I lifted my gun
            Si
And I fired away...


        Mi
And the shells
                   Sol#m
Jumped through the smoke.
             La
And into the sand,
                       Mi
That the blood now had soaked,
        La
She collapsed,
                   Mi
With a flag in her hand.
                Si
A flag white as snow.


          Do#m
A hero of war!
                  La
Is that what they see?
               Mi
Just medals and scars?
                 Si
So damn proud of me.
                        Do#m
And I brought home that flag.
               La
Now it gathers dust.
                       Mi
But it's a flag that I love.
                     Si
It's the only flag I trust.


         Mi                      Sol#m
He said "Son, have you seen the world?
                     La
Well, what would you say
                   Mi
If I said that you could?"</pre>]
