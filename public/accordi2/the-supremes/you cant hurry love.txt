       La#
I need love, love
   Re#      La#
To ease my mind
          Rem           Solm     Re#
I need to find, find someone to call mine
    Fa
But mama said
    La#
You can't hurry love
        Re#          La#
No, you just have to wait
         Rem             Solm
Re#            Fa7
It's a game of give and take
    La#
You can't hurry love
         Re#         La#
No, you just have to wait
           Rem    Solm
You got to trust, give it time
   Re#        Fa7
No matter how long it takes

    Rem
But how many heartaches
                      Solm
Must I stand before I find a love

To let me live again
              Re#
Right now the only thing

That keeps me hangin' on
       Fa
When I feel my strength, yeah

It's almost gone

I remember mama said:

    La#
You can't hurry love
        Re#          La#
No, you just have to wait
         Rem             Solm
She said love don't come easy
Re#            Fa7
It's a game of give and take
    La#
How long must I wait
         Re#        La#
How much more can I take
       Rem   Solm      Re#      Fa7
Before loneliness will cause my heart
                La#  Re#  La#   Rem Solm  Re# Fa7
Heart to break?

   Rem
No I can't bear to live my life alone
         Solm
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
           Re#
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
      Fa         Fa6          Fa7
These precious words keeps me hangin' on

I remember mama said:
    La#
You can't hurry love
        Re#          La#
No, you just have to wait
         Rem             Solm

You got to trust, give it time
   Re#        Fa7
No matter how long it takes

La#                         Re#   La#
  No, love, love don't come easy
      Rem     Solm
But I keep on waiting
Re#    Fa7             La#
Anticipating for that soft voice
           Re#   La#
To talk to me at night
         Rem    Solm
For some tender arms
   Re#      Fa7
To hold me tight
       La#
I keep waiting
          Re#      La#
I keep on waiting
             Rem   Solm
But it ain't easy
         Re#   Fa7
It ain't easy

You got to trust, give it time
   Re#        Fa7
No matter how long it takes...
