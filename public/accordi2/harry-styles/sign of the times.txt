Fa
Just stop your crying
                   Rem
It’s a sign of the times
               Do
Welcome to the final show

Hope you’re wearing your best clothes
Fa
You can't bribe the door
                   Rem
On your way to the sky
                Do
You look pretty good down here

But you ain't really good...


Fa
If we never learn we've been here before
Rem
Why are we always stuck and
                   Do
running from the bullets
       Do7
The bullets...

We gotta get away from here
              Do7
We gotta get away from here
Fa
Just stop your crying
            Rem
It’ll be alright
                      Do
They told me that the end is near
              Do7
We gotta get away from here


Fa
Just stop your crying
                      Rem
Have the time of your life
                     Do
Breakin' through the atmosphere

Things look pretty good from here

Fa                             Rem
Remember everything will be alright
               Do
We could meet again somewhere.

Somewhere far away from here.
