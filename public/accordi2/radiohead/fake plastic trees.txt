Her green plastic watering can
          Mi          Mi6        Re5
For her fake chinese rubber plant
              La     Re5
In the fake plastic earth
La                               Fa#m7 
That she bought from a rubber man
           Mi        Mi6      Re5 
In a town full of rubber plans
       La      Re5 
To get rid of itself
 

             Sim7
It wears her out..
             La        Lasus
It wears her out..
             Sim7
It wears her out..
             La        Lasus
It wears her out
 

La                         Fa#m7
She lives with a broken man
        Mi    Mi6       Re5  
A cracked polystyrene man 
          La           Re5  
Who just crumbles and burns
La                   Fa#m7
He used to do surgery
        Mi       Mi6    Re5  
For girls in the eighties
            La      Re5 
But gravity always wins
 

            Sim7
It wears him out..
             La        Lasus
It wears him out..
             Sim7
It wears him out..
             La        Lasus
It weaaaaaaarrrs
 

La                            Fa#m7
She looks like the real thing
         Mi          Mi6      Re5
She tastes like the real thing
          La     Re5    
My fake plastic love
La                         Fa#m7
But I can't help the feeling
          Mi         Mi6        Re5
I could blow through the ceiling
           La        Re5
If I just turn and run


            Sim7
It wears me out..
            La        Lasus
It wears me out..
            Sim7
It wears me out..
            La        Lasus
It wears me out


               Sim7
And if I could be who you wanted
           La   
If I could be who you wanted
       Sim7
All the time..
       La
All the time..
