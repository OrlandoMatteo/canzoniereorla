Sim
 Just as you take my hand

Just as you write my number down

Just as the drinks arrive
                                 Sol
Just as they play your favourite song
        Fa#m       Mim9
As your bad day disappears
                            La
No longer wound up  like a  spring
  Sol         Fa#m    Mim9
Before you've had too much

Come back in focus again
Sim
 The walls are bending shape

You've got a cheshire cat grin

All blurring into one

This place is on a mission
Sol   Fa#m    Mim9
 Before the night owl
                     La
Before the animal noises
          Sol   Mim9
Closed circuit cameras
                      Re6
Before you comatose

Sim
 Before you run away from me

Before you're lost between the notes

The beat goes round and round
                         Sol
The beat goes round and round
        Fa#m       Mim9
I never really got there
                         La
I just pretended that I had
          Sol   Fa#m Mim9
Words are blunt instruments

Words are sawn off shotguns

Sim
 Come on and let it out

Come on and let it out

Come on and let it out

Come on and let it out
Sol         Fa#m     Mim9
 Before you run away from me
                                La
Before your lost between the notes
        Sol Fa#m    Mim9
Just as you take the mic
            Sim
Just as you dance, dance, dance

Sim
A Jigsaw falling into place

So there is nothing to explain
    Fa#/La#
You eye each other as you pass
Remaj7
She looks back and you look back
Solmaj7  Re7+/Fa#
Not just once
Solmaj7      Re7+/Fa#
and not just twice
Sim
Wish away your nightmare

Wish away the nightmare
            Fa#/La#
You got the light you can feel it on your back
  Remaj7
A light, you can feel it on your back
Solmaj7       Re7+/Fa#
Your jigsaw falling
Solmaj7  Re7+/Fa#      Sim
into   plac
