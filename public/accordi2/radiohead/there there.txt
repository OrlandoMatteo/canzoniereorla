 In pitch dark

I go walking in your landscape

Broken branches
             Sol/Si    La
Trip me as I speak
               Fa#m
Just cause you feel it
                  Sol/Si    La
Doesn't mean it's there
               Fa#m
Just cause you feel it
                  Sol    Sim9
Doesn't mean it's there
Sim7
 There's always a siren
                Sol/Si
Singing you to shipwreck

(Don't reach out, don't reach out

Don't reach out, don't reach out)
Sim7
 Steer away from these rocks
                    Sol/Si
We'd be a walking disaster

(Don't reach out, don't reach out

Don't reach out, don't reach out)
La              Fa#m
 Just cause you feel it
                  Sol/Si
Doesn't mean it's there

(Someone on your shoulder, someone on your shoulder)
La              Fa#m
 Just cause you feel it
                  Sol/Si
Doesn't mean it's there

(Someone on your shoulder, someone on your shoulder)
Sim           Rem7 La   Mim
There, there!

Sim7             Rem7
Why so green and lonely?
 Laadd9  Mim9
Lonely, lonely?
Sim7            Rem7
Heaven sent you to me
Laadd9    Mim9
To me, to me

Sim7     Rem7  Laadd9   Mim9

Sim7             Rem7
We are accidents waiting
Laadd9     Mim9
Waiting to happen
Sim7             Rem7
We are accidents waiting
Laadd9     Mim9    Sim9
Waiting to happen
