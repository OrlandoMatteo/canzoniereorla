Sol#m
Rows of houses, all bearing down on me

I can feel their blue hands touching me
Re#m7
All these things into position
                                            Sol#m
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
    Si   Re#m7 Sol#m    Si   Re#m7
And fade out  again and fade out

Sol#m
This machine will, will not communicate

These thoughts and the strain I am under
Re#m7
Be a world child, form a circle
                 Sol#m
Before we all go under
    Si   Re#m7 Sol#m   Si   Re#m7 Sol#m
And fade out again and fade out again

Si  Re#m7  Sol#m     Si  Re#m7

Sol#m
Cracked eggs, dead birds

Scream as they fight for life

I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
Re#m7
All these things into position
                                         Sol#m
All these things we'll one day swallow whole

    Si   Re#m7 Sol#m   Si   Re#m7 Sol#m
And fade out again and fade out again

Si  Re#m7  Sol#m     Si  Re#m7  Sol#m

  Fa#        Re#7    Sol#m
Immerse your soul in love
  Fa#        Re#7    Sol#m
Immerse your soul in love
