I don't wanna be your friend
La#4   La#           Faadd9
I just wanna be your lover
   Fa
No matter how it ends
   La#4      La#    Faadd9
No matter how it starts
   Fa
Forget about your house of cards
    La#4  La# Faadd9
And I'll do mine

Forget about your house of cards
    La#4 La# Faadd9
And I'll do mine

La#4 La#     La#4 La#
Fall off the table
    La#4 La#  Faadd9
And get swept under
Solm           Faadd9
 Denial, denial

    Fa
The infrastructure will collapse
La#          Faadd9
From voltage spikes

Throw your keys in the bowl
     La#4   La#        Fa      Faadd9
Kiss your husband 'goodnight'

Forget about your house of cards
    La#4 La# Fa
And I'll do mine

La#4 La#     La#4 La#
Fall off the table
    La#4 La#  Faadd9   Fa
And get swept under
Solm            Faadd9
  Denial, denial
Solm            Faadd9
  Denial, denial
                       Solm
Your ears should be burning

Denial, denial
     Faadd9            Solm
Your ears should be burning

(Denial...)
