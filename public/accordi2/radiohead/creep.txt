[<pre>Sol Si Do Dom


                     Sol                              Si
When you were here before, couldn't look you in the eyes
                    Do                         Dom
You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry
                 Sol                      Si
You float like a feather in a beautiful world
             Do                          Dom
I wish I was special, you're so fucking special


Sol x3
          Sol            Si
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
                         Do               Dom
What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here


                   Sol                      Si
I don't care if it hurts, I wanna have control
                 Do                      Dom
I want a perfect body, I want a perfect soul
              Sol                    Si
I want you to notice when I'm not around
                  Do                     Dom
You're so fucking special, I wish I was special

Sol x3
          Sol            Si
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
                         Do               Dom
What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here

            Sol                     Si
Oooh, oooh, she's running out the door...
Do                      Dom                
She's running out, she run, run, run...
Sol     Si
Ruuuuuuuun...
Do     Dom
Ruuuuuuuuuuun...

                   Sol                   Si
Whatever makes you happy, whatever you want
                  Do                     Dom
You're so fucking special, I wish I was special


          Sol            Si
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
                         Do               Dom
What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here
          Sol
I don't belong here</pre>]
