You get a shiver in the dark, it's raining in the park but meantime
Rem                        Do            La#         La
  South of the river you stop and you hold everything
Fa                                 Do
  A band is blowing Dixie double four time
La#                                            Rem    La# - Do

              Rem                  Do         La#        La
Well now, you step inside but you don't see too many faces
Rem                      Do                La#      La
   Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
Fa                       Do
  Competition in other places
La#                                     Rem

   And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene

  He's got a daytime job, he's doin' alright
Fa                                  Do

Then a crowd of young boys, they're foolin' around in the corner
Rem                                Do              La#            La
   Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles
Fa                                        Do
  They don't give a damn about about any trumpet playin' band
La#                                   Rem     La# - Do

Rem              Do               La#        La    (La7)
   And says at last just as the time bell ring
Fa                      Do
  Goodnight, now it's time to go home
La#                                       Rem     La# - Do
   Then he makes it fast with one more thing
                   La# - Do
