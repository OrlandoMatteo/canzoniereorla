      Re#m         Mi  Fa#
These mist covered mountains
                 Si   Si4   Si
Are home now for me
       Re#m/La     Sol#m  Re#m/Fa#
But my home is the low    lands
                Mi   Fa#4   Fa#
And always will be
                 Sol#m  Re#m/Fa#
Someday you'll return to
                     Mi    Do#m7   Fa#4
Your valley and your farms
           Fa#       Sol#m
And you'll no longer burn
      Mi          Fa#4
To be brothers in arms

              Re#m         Mi  Fa#
Through these fields of destruction
            Si   Si4   Si
Baptisms of fire
     Re#m/La            Sol#m  Re#m/Fa#
I've witnessed all your suffering
                     Mi     Fa#4   Fa#
As the battles raged higher
                    Sol#m      Re#m/Fa#
And though they did hurt me so bad
                 Mi    Do#m   Fa#4
In the fear and alarm
    Fa#       Sol#m
You did not desert me
   Mi          Fa#4   Fa#
My brothers in arms


     Sol#m  Mi  Do#m  Mi  Sol#m  Mi  Do#m

     Do#m  Sol#m

           Fa#            Sol#m   Fa#
There's so many different worlds
   Si             Mi    Fa#4
So many different suns
    Fa#              Sol#m   Fa#
And we have just one world
       Si                Mi
But we live in different ones


     Sol#m  Mi  Do#m  Mi  Sol#m  Mi  Do#m

     Do#m  Sol#m

        Re#m/La       Mi   Fa#
Now the sun's gone to hell
                      Si   Si4   Si
And the moon's riding high
       Re#m/La      Sol#m   Re#m/Fa#
Let me bid your farewell
                 Mi   Fa#4
Every man has to die
        Fa#            Sol#m  Re#m/Fa#
But its written in the star...light
                       Mi    Do#m   Fa#4
ANd every line on your palm
      Fa#           Sol#m
We're fools to make war
       Mi          Fa#
On our brothers in arms
