Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies

Be-Bop-A-Lua, Baby What I Say

Here comes Johnny singing I Gotta Woman

down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay
La
 He got the action, he got the motion;
Mi
 Oh yeah, the boy can play
La
 Dedication, devotion;
Mi
turning all the night time into the day
                                      Si
He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman
          Mi                   La
He do the song about the knife
          Mi   Si                 La
He do the walk, he do the walk of life
Si                      Mi    La   Si   La  Si
Yeah, he do the walk of life

Mi
Here comes Johnny and he'll tell you the story;

hand me down mu walkin' shoes

Here come Johnny with the power and the glory

backbeat the talkin' blues
La
 He got the action, he got the motion;
Mi
 Oh yeah, the boy can play
La
 Dedication, devotion
Mi
turning all the night time into the day
                                      Si
He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman
          Mi             La
He do the song about the knife
          Mi   Si                 La

And after all the violence and double talk
               Mi                          La
There's just a song in the trouble and the strife
           Mi    Si                      La
You do the walk, yeh, you do the walk of life;
Si                  Mi    La    Si    La  Si
 you do the walk of life

Mi   La   Si   La  Si  Mi   La   Si   La  Si
