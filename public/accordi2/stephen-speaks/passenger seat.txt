Sol   Mim   Do   Re   Re4   Re   Resus2   Re  Re4


Sol
I look at her and have to smile
Mim
As we go driving for a while
Do                       Re       Re   Re4  Re   Resus2  Re  Re4
Her hair blowing in the open window of my car
Sol
And as we go the I see the lights
Mim
Watch them glimmer in her eyes
Do                Re       Re   Re4  Re   Resus2  Re  Re4
In the darkness of the evening


Sol
And I've got all that I need
Mim
Right here in the passenger seat
Do
Oh and I can't keep my eyes on the road
Re       Re   Re4  Re   Resus2   Re  Re4
Knowing that she's inches from me
Sol
We stop to get something to drink
Mim
My mind pounds and I can't think
Do                Re       Re   Re4   Re   Resus2  Re  Re4
Scared to death to say I love her
Sol
Then a moon peeks from the clouds
Mim
Hear my heart that beats so loud
Do                Re       Re   Re4   Re   Resus2  Re  Re4
Try to tell her simply


Sol
That I've got all the I need
Mim
Right here in the passenger seat
Do
Oh and I can't keep my eyes on the road
Re       Re   Re4  Re   Resus2   Re  Re4
Knowing that she's inches from me
Sol
Oh and I've got all the I need

Mim     Re4  Re Do         Re
Oh and I know this love grow
