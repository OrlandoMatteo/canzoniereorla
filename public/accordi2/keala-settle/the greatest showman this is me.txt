Sim                  La      Re
 I'm not a stranger to the dark
       Sol           Sim
Hide away, they say
                  La
'Cause we don't want your broken parts
      Sim                       La     Re
I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars
    Sol              Sim
Run away, they say
            La
No one will love you as you are


   Sol                            La      Sim
But I won't let them break me down to dust
                         La       Re
I know that there's a place for us
              La
For we are glorious


          Re
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
           Sim
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out
          Sol
I am brave, I am bruised
      La
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me
Re
 Look out 'cause here I come
          Sim
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
              Sol
I'm not scared to be seen
       La
I make no apologies, this is me

 Sim              La                Re
Another round of bullets hits my skin
           Sol             Sim           La
Well, fire away 'cause today, I won't let the shame sink in
      Sim                           La
We are bursting through the barricades
     Re                            Sol    Sim
And reaching for the sun (we are warriors)
         La
Yeah, that's what we'll become
