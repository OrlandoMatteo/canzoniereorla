Didn't know what time it was the lights were low-ow-ow.
Fa
 I lean back on my radio-o-o
Do                            Do7
 Some cat was laying down some rock'n'roll,
                     Fa  Sol# La#
'Lotta soul' he said.



Solm
 Then the loud sound did seem to fa-a-ade
Fa
 Came back like a slow voice on a wave of pha-a-ase
Do                            Do7              La    Sol
 That weren't no DJ that was hazy cosmic jive.



          Fa       Rem
There's a starman waiting in the sky
     Lam               Do
He'd like to come and meet us
       Do7
But he thinks he'd blow our minds.
          Fa       Rem
There's a starman waiting in the sky
     Lam             Do
He's told us not to blow it
          Do7
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile,

He told me,
La#          La#m             Fa         Re7
   "Let the children lose it, let the children use it,
Solm             Do 
   Let all the children boogie."

Solm
  Well I had to phone someone so I picked on you-ou-ou
Fa
  Hey that's far out, so you heard him too-oo-oo
Do                       Do7                   Fa  Sol# La#
  Switch on the TV we may pick him up on Channel 2.


Solm
  Look out your window I can see his li-i-ight,
Fa
  If we can sparkle he may land toni-i-ight,
Do                            Do7                 La    Sol
 Don't tell your papa or he'll get us locked up in fright.
