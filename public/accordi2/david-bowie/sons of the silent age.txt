[<pre>La  Sib  Si  Do  Re 
Sol 
    Sons of the silent age
Fa 
Stand on platforms blank looks and note books
Sol 
Sit in back rows of city limits
       Fa 
Lay in bed coming and going on easy terms
Sol 
    Sons of the silent age
Fa 
Pace their rooms like a cell's dimensions
     Sol 
Rise for a year or two then make war
                     Fa 
Search through their one inch thoughts
Then decide it couldn't be done
Mib        Re            Do# 
Baby, I'll never let you go
      Do           Lab 
All I see is all I know
            Sib        Mib 
Let's take another way down
(sons of sound and sons of sound)
                 Re            Do# 
Baby, baby, I'll never let you down
        Do            Lab 
I can't stand another sound
             Sib           Mib 
Let's find another way in
(sons of sound and sons of sound)
La  Sib  Si  Do  Re 
Sol 
    Sons of the silent age
Fa 
Listen to tracks by Sam Therapy and King Dice
Sol 
    Sons of the silent age
Fa 
Pick up in bars and cry only once
Sol 
    Sons of the silent age
Fa 
Make love only once but dream and dream
     Sol 
They don't walk, they just glide in and out of life
     Fa 
They never die, they just go to sleep one day
Mib           Re           Do# 
Baby, I won't ever let you go
      Do           Lab 
All I see is all I know
            Sib        Mib 
Let's take another way down
(sons of sound and sons of sound)
   Mib                       Re           Do# 
Oh baby, baby, baby, I won't ever let you down
        Do            Lab 
I can't stand another sound
             Sib           Mib 
Let's find another way in
(sons of sound and sons of sound)
Si 
(Sons of sound and sons of sound)
                  Lab 
Baby, baby, baby,
            Mib 
fire away!
