Watching them come and go The templars and the saracens
                      Sol  	      La 
They're traveling the holy land Opening telegrams oh ho

Torture comes and torture goes Knights who'd give you anything
                       Sol 
They bear the cross of coeur de lion
                  La              Fa# 
Salvation for the mirror blind oh ho
           Solm  Fa                      Dom 
But if you pray all your sins are hooked upon the sky
Lam          Mim         Re#        Re 
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear
Sol                           La 
Prayers they hide the saddest view

         Sol                           La 
And your prayers they break the sky in two

Thinking of a different time Palestine a modern problem
                Sol  	          La 
Bounty and your wealth in land Terror in a best laid plan oh ho

Watching them come and go Tomorrows and the yesterdays
                   Sol               La                Fa# 
Christians and the unbelievers Hanging by the cross and nail oh ho
