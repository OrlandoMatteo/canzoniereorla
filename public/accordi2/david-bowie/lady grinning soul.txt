             Fa#m 
She'll come,      she'll go
             Sol 
She'll lay belief on you
                La 
Skin sweet with musky oil
    Sol#m                      Si 
The lady from another grinning soul
       Fa#m 
Cologne     she'll wear
       Sol 
Silver and Americard
       La 
She'll drive a beetle car
    Sol#m                     Si 
And beat you down at cool Canasta
             Mibm                Si 
And when the clothes are strewn
           Sib         Si 
Don't be afraid of the room
                          Do# 
Touch the fullness of her breast
                 Mi 
Feel the love of her caress
                        Sol#m  Fa#m 
She will be your living end
Fa#m  Sol  La  Sol#m  Si 
             Fa#m 
She'll come,      she'll go
             Sol 
She'll lay belief on you
                        La 
But she won't stake her life on you
Sol#m                       Si 
How can life become point of view
             Mibm                Si 
And when the clothes are strewn
           Sib         Si 
Don't be afraid of the room
                          Do# 
Touch the fullness of her breast
                 Mi 
Feel the love of her caress
                        Sol#m  Sol 
She will be your living end
                        Sol#m  Si 
She will be your living end
                        Sol#m  Sol 
She will be your living end

She will be your living end
