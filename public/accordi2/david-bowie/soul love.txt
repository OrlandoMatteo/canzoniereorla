[<pre>Sol 
Stone love, she kneels before the grave
  Mim                                     Do 
A brave son who gave his life to save the slogan
                                          Sol 
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
Sim                Lam          Re 
For they penetrate her grieving
Sol 
New love, a boy and girl are talking
Mim 
New words that only they can share in
Do 
New words, a love so strong it tears their hearts
   Sol   Sim                  Lam              Re 
To sleep through the fleeting hours of morning
Lam 
Love is careless in its choosing,
Mim 
sweeping over cross and baby
Fa               Do 
Love descends on those defenseless
Re 
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Do           Re                  Sol7              Do 
Inspirations have I none just to touch the flaming dove
Dom              Sol              Re 
All I have is my love of love and love is not loving
Sol  Mim  Do  Sol  Sim  Lam  Re 
La 
Soul love, the priest that tastes the word and
Fa#m 
Told of love and how my God on high is
Re                                        La 
All love though reaching up my loneliness evolves
Do#m                  Sim           Mi 
By the blindness that surrounds him
Sim 
Love is careless in its choosing,
Fa#m 
sweeping over cross and baby
Sol              Re 
Love descends on those defenseless
Mi 
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Re           Mi                  La7               Re 
Inspirations have I none just to touch the flaming dove
Rem              La               Mi 
All I have is my love of love and love is not loving
