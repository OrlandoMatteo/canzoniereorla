Sol 
Do you remember a guy that's been
Mim 
In such an early song
Do 
I've heard a rumor from ground control
Re 
Oh no don't say it's true
Fa 
They got a message from the action man
Do        Mim               Fa 
I'm happy hope you're happy too
                           Sol 
I've loved all I've needed love
          Mi 
Sordid details following
La 
The shrieking of nothing is killing me
Mi 
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis
Sol                                         Re 
And I ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
Fa 
but i'm hoping to kick
                  Do      Mim 
but the planet is glowing aglow aglow
Fa             Sol 
Ashes to Ashes funk to funky
Do            Lam 
We know major Tom's a junky
Fa                     Sol 
Strung out in heaven's high

Hitting an all time low

Sol 
Time and again I tell myself
Mim 
I'll stay clean tonight
Do                                        Re 
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again
Fa 
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
Do        Mim               Fa 
I'm happy hope you're happy too
                   Sol               Mi 
One flash of light but no smoking pistol
La 
I've never done good things
Mi 
I've never done bad things
Sol                             Re 
I never did anything out of the blue
Fa 
I want an axe to break the ice
Do                        Mim 
I want to come down right now
Fa             Sol 
Ashes to Ashes funk to funky
Do            Lam 
We know major Tom's a junky
Fa                     Sol 
Strung out in heaven's high

My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with major Tom
