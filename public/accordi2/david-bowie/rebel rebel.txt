You've torn your dress, your face is a mess
    Resus2                   Mi                    Mi6
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
                Resus2                     Mi        Mi6
You've got your   transmission and your live wire
             Resus2              Mi               Mi6
You got your   cue line and a handful of ludes
          Resus2                  Mi                 Mi6
You wanna   be there when they count up the dudes
      Resus2             Mi   Mi6
And I love your dress
         Resus2              Mi   Mi6
You're a juvenile success
             Resus2            Mi   Mi6
Because your face is a mess
   Resus2                 Mi   Mi6

                  Mi   Mi6
Where'd you wanna go
           Resus2
What can I do for you
                  Mi             Mi6
Looks like you've been there too
             Resus2             Mi   Mi6
Cause you've torn your dress
         Resus2            Mi   Mi6
