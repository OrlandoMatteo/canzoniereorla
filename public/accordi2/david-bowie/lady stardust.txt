People stared at the makeup on his face
La             Fa#m             Mi         Do# 
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
Fa#m           Re 
The boy in the bright blue jeans
La               Do# 
Jumped up on the stage
    La            Mi 
And lady stardust sang his songs
   Re               Mi 
Of darkness and disgrace
           La Mi        Re           Mi 
And he was alright, the band was altogether
           La Mi        Re               Mi 
Yes he was alright, the songs went on forever

Really quite out of sight
            La  Mi    Re    Mi 
And he sang all night long
La          Do#                Fa#m 
The femme fatales Emerged from shadows
              Re 
To watch this creature fair
La          Fa#m 
Boys stood upon their chairs
   Mi                  Do# 
to make their point of view
Fa#m     Re          La 
I smiled sadly for a love
             Do# 
I could not obey
    La            Mi 
And Lady Stardust sang his songs
   Re              Mi 
Of darkness and dismay
           La Mi        Re           Mi
