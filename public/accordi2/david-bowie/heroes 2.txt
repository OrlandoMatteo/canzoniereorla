I.. I wish you could swim
         Re                           Sol
Like the dolphins.. like dolphins can swim
       Do                               Re
Though nothing.. nothing will keep us together
       Lam       Mim           Re
We can beat them.. forever and ever
             Do    Sol           Re
Oh we can be Heroes just for one day

I.. I will be King
    Re                Sol
And you.. you will be Queen
    Do                       Re
For nothing will drive them away
          Lam    Mim            Re
We can be Heroes.. just for one day

We can be honest.. just for one day

Re          Sol
I.. I can remember (I remember)
Re              Sol
Standing by the wall (By the wall)
        Re           Sol
And the guards shot above our heads (Over our heads)
       Re                             Sol
And we kissed as though nothing would fall (Nothing could fall)

        Do               Re
And the shame was on the other side
          Lam       Mim           Re
Oh we can beat them.. forever and ever
                 Do   Sol            Re
Then we can be Heroes.. just for one day
