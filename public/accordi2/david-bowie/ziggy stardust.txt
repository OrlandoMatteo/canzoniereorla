   Ziggy played guitar,    jamming good
               Do                         Re 
with Wierd and Gilly and the Spiders from Mars.
                  Sol                   Mim 
He played it left hand, but made it too far
           Lam                      Do 
became the special man, and we were Ziggy's band.
Sol                        Sim 
   Ziggy really sang, with screwed up eyes and
             Do                         Re 
screwed down hairdo like some cat from Japan.
                     Sol                            Mim 
He could lick 'em by smiling, he could leave 'em to hang.
              Lam                       Do 
He came on so loaded man, well hung and snow-white tan.
Lam    Sol            Fa     Sol 
   But where were the spiders,
Lam          Sol          Fa              Sol 
   while the fly tried to break our balls.
Lam         Sol           Fa 
   Just the beer light to guide us.
          Re 
And so we bitched about his fans
              Mi 
and should we crush his sweet hands.

   Ziggy played for time, jiving us that
        Do                           Re 
we were voodoo and the kids was just crass.
           Sol                 Mi 
He was the nazz with God-given ass.
           Lam                          Do 
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar.
Lam       Sol           Fa   Sol 
   Making love with his ego,
Lam      Sol        Fa          Sol 
   Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Lam       Sol      Fa   Sol 
   Like a leper messiah.
         Re 
When the kids had killed the man
         Mi 
I had to break up the band.
