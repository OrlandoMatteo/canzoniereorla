     La7  Rem  Fa  Rem

                   La7
We passed upon the stair
                        Rem
We spoke of was and when
                  La7
Although I was'nt there
                        Fa
He said I was his friend
                      Do
Which came as some surprise
                 La7
I spoke into his eyes
                    Rem
I thought you died alone
                  Do
A long long time ago

   Do     Fa
Oh no not me
  La#m          Fa
I never lost control
       Do      Fa
You're face to face
         La#m
With the man who sold the world


     La7  Rem  Fa  Rem

                        La7
I laughed and shook his hand
                         Rem
And made my way back home
                        La7
I searched for form and land
                            Fa
For years and years I roamed
                 Do
I gazed a gazley stare
                    La7
At all the millions here
                   Rem
We must have died alone
                  Do
A long long time ago

    Do         Fa
Who knows, Not me
   La#m          Fa
We never lost control
       Do      Fa
You're face to face
         La#m
With the man who sold the world


     La7  Rem  Fa  Rem

    Do         Fa
Who knows, Not me
   La#m          Fa
We never lost control
       Do      Fa
You're face to face
         La#m
With the man who sold the world
