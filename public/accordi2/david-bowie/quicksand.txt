[<pre>Sol  Lam  (X4) 
    Do 
I'm closer to the Golden Dawn
                                  Sol 
Immersed in Crowley's uniform of imagery
    Do 
I'm living in a silent film
                                     Sol 
Portraying Himmler's sacred realm of dream reality
    Mib 
I'm frightened by the total goal
     Fa 
I'm drawing to the ragged hole
      Sol           Mim       Do 
And I ain't got the power  anymore
     Do            Domaj7   Sol   Lam  Lasus2 La 
No I ain't got the power anymore
        Re 
I'm the twisted name on Garbo's eyes
                                          La 
I'm living proof of Churchill's lies, I'm destiny
    Re 
I'm torn between the light and dark
                                       La 
Where others see their targets, divine symmetry
Fa 
Should I kiss the viper's fang
   Sol 
Or herald loud the death of Man
    La             Fa#m            Re 
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
      Re            Remaj7   La 
And I ain't got the power anymore
La      Mi           Fa#m 
Don't believe in yourself
        Si7          Mi 
Don't deceive with belief
          Mim                  Sim 
Knowledge comes with death's release
Ladim   La  Fa#m  Do#m  Mi 
aaaaaahhhh aaaaaaahhh
    Re 
I'm not a prophet or a stone age man
                                                La 
Just a mortal with potential of a superman, I'm living on
    Re 
I'm tethered to the logic of Homo Sapien'
Can't take my eyes from the great salvation
   La 
of bullshit faith
     Fa 
If I don't explain what you ought to know
        Sol 
You can tell me all about it on the next Bardo
    La             Fa#m            Re 
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought

        Si7          Mi 
Don't deceive with belief
          Mim                  Sim 
Knowledge comes with death's release

Don't believe in yourself
