[<pre>       Mim                Re6add9
On the first part of the journey
       Mim                Re6add9
I was lookin at all the life
            Mim                 Re6add9
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
            Mim                Re6add9
There were sand and hills and rings

       Mim                  Re6add9
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
         Mim           Re6add9
and the sky with no clouds
     Mim                   Re6add9
the heat was hot and the ground was dry
         Mim              Re6add9
but the air was full of sound

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
        Mim9                   Remaj9
it felt good to be out of the rain
       Mim9           Remaj9
in the desert you can remember your name
              Mim9                Remaj9
'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
   Mim9    Remaj9         
La la   la la lala la lala   
Mim9    Remaj9

       Mim                Re6add9
After two days in the desert sun
    Mim                Re6add9
my skin began to turn red
       Mim              Re6add9
After three days in the desert fun
       Mim                Re6add9
I was looking at a river bed
        Mim                Re6add9
And the story it told of a river that flowed
       Mim                 Re6add9
made me sad to think it was dead


      Mim9                         Remaj9
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
        Mim9                   Remaj9

       Mim9           Remaj9

   Mim9    Remaj9         
la la   la la lala la lala   
Mim9    Remaj9         
la la la 


       Mim                Re6add9
After nine days I let the horse run free
            Mim                Re6add9
'cause the desert had turned to sea
            Mim                  Re6add9 
there were plants and birds and rocks and things
             Mim                Re6add9
there were sand and hills and rings
      Mim                        Re6add9
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground
          Mim              Re6add9
and the perfect disguise above
            Mim           Re6add9
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
         Mim                 Re6add9
but the humans will give no love
