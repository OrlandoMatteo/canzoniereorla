          Do                            Mim
Well, I tried to make it Sunday, but I got so damn depressed, 
        Fa                Do            Mim
that I set my sights on Monday and I got myself undressed 
         Fa              Rem         Lam  Mim             Fa
I ain't ready for the altar, but I do agree there's times, 
        Rem            Fa              Do   Do4 Do
when a woman sure can be a friend of mine 


         Do                                  Mim
Well, I keep on thinkin' 'bout you, Sister Golden Hair surprise, 
       Fa                   Do                  Mim
and I just can't live without you; can't you see it in my eyes? 
        Fa              Rem                  Lam      Mim      Fa
I been one poor correspondent, and I been too, too hard to find, 
        Rem               Fa                Do
but it doesn't mean you ain't been on my mind 


          Sol                               Fa              Do
Will you meet me in the middle, will you meet me in the air? 
           Sol                           Fa                 Do
Will you love me just a little, just enough to show you care? 
        Rem                  Mim                   Fa
Well I tried to fake it, I don't mind sayin', I just can't make it
