Sol           Do     
    Saying I love you 
Lam                 Do       Re             Sol 
Is not the words I want to hear from you 
              Do 
It's not that I want you 
Lam                 Do      Re    Mim
   Not to say, but if you only knew 
Sol    Lam    Re              Sol       Re       Mim
  How easy it would be to show me how you feel 
Sol         Lam       Re             Sol7     Sol7      Do
More than words is all you have to do to make it real 
         Dom                Sol       Mim   Sol   Mim  Sol
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me 
    Lam    Re     Sol
Cos I'd already know 


                 Re      Mim    Sol    Re      Do    
What would you do if my heart was torn in two 
                             Lam
More than words to show you feel 
           Re             Sol
That your love for me is real 
               Re        Mim   Sol     Re      Do          
What would you say if I took those words away 
                              Lam
Then you couldn't make things new 
           Re           Sol
Just by saying I love you 


Sol            Do       Lam        Do      Re         Sol 
  Now I've tried to talk to you and make you understand 
         Do           Lam                 
All you have to do is close your eyes 
    Do          Re        Mim   Sol   Lam 
And just reach out your hands and touch me 
Re                   Sol    Re      Mim
Hold me close don't ever let me go 
Sol         Lam       Re          Sol7             Do          
More than words is all I ever needed you to show 
           Dom               Sol     Mim   Sol   Mim  Sol
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me 
    Lam     Re    Sol   
Cos I'd already know 


                Re       Mim    Sol   Re       Do
What would you do if my heart was torn in two 
                            Lam
More than words to show you feel 
          Re              Sol
That your love for me is real 
                 Re     Mim     Sol      Re    Do
What would you say if I took those words away 
                              Lam
Then you couldn't make things new 
         Re               Sol
Just by saying I love you</pre>]
