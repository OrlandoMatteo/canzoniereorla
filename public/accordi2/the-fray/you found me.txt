[<pre>Mi Si     Sol#m
I found god
       Fa#        Si              Mi  
On the corner of first and Amistad
Mi     Si   Sol#m      Fa#  Si   Mi
Where the west was all but won
Mi   Si  Sol#m Fa#         Si    Mi
All alone smoking his last cigarette
       Mi     Si   Sol#m        Fa#  Si  Mi
I Said where you been, he said ask anything


Sol#m    Fa#  Mi
Where were you?
     Fa#         Si           Mi
When everything was falling apart
Sol#m Fa#  Mi        Fa#    Si      Mi
All my days were spent by the telephone
   Fa#  Si Mi
It never rang
    Fa#    Si      Mi
And all I needed was a call
     Fa# Si  Mi
That never came
       Sol#m       Fa#        Mi   Fa#  Si
To the corner of first and Amistad


Sol#m      Mi
Lost and insecure
Si             Fa#
You found me, you found me
Sol#m          Mi
Lying on the floor
Si           Fa#
Surrounded, surrounded
Sol#m               Mi
Why’d you have to wait?
Si               Fa#
Where were you? Where were you?
Sol#m           Mi
Just a little late
Si             Fa#  Si     Mi
You found me, you found me


Sol#m Fa# Mi   Fa#     Si      Mi   
In the end everyone ends up alone
Sol#m Fa# Mi    Fa#    Si      Mi 
Losing her, the only one who’s ever known
Si   Mi Sol#m         Fa#                 Mi
Who I am, who I’m not, who I want to be 
  Si   Fa# Mi       Fa#         
No way to know how long 
         Si         Mi
she will be next to me




Sol#m      Mi
Lost and insecure
Si             Fa#
You found me, you found me
Sol#m          Mi
Lying on the floor
Si           Fa#
Surrounded, surrounded
Sol#m               Mi
Why’d you have to wait?
Si               Fa#
Where were you? Where were you?
Sol#m           Mi
Just a little late
Si             Fa#  Si     Mi
You found me, you found me


Fa#  Si Mi        Fa# Si Mi 
Early morning, City breaks      
Fa#   Si    Mi           Fa#   Si    Mi 
I’ve been calling for years and years and 
Fa#   Si Mi
years and years
        Fa#    Si    Mi
And you never left me no messages
          Fa#   Si     Mi
You never send me no letters
                     Fa#           
You got some kind of nerve, 
Si Mi
taking all I want

Sol#m      Mi
Lost and insecure
Si             Fa#
You found me, you found me
Sol#m          Mi
Lying on the floor
Si              Fa#
Where were you where were you


Sol#m      Mi

Lying on the floor
Si           Fa#
Surrounded, surrounded
Sol#m       Mi
Why’d you have to wait?
Si               Fa#
Where were you? Where were you?
Sol#m           Mi
Just a little late
Si             Fa#  Si     Mi
You found me, you found me

Why’d you have to wait?

To find me, to find me</pre>]
