I never knew
    Mim              Sol             Do
I never knew that everything was falling through
        Mim        Sol               Do
That everyone I knew was waiting on a queue
    Mim       Sol               Lam   Mim        Re
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
                     Do
But that's how it's got to be
       Mim              Sol               Do
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
      Mim             Sol              Do
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
      Mim        Sol           Lam      Mim        Re
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears


Do    Sol    Mim        Sol
Everyone knows I'm in
Do        Sol     Mim      Re
Over my head, over my head
       Do    Sol              Mim     Sol
With eight seconds left in overtime
      Lam       Sol          Mim   Re    Do
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

Let's rearrange
   Mim              Sol                Do
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
    Mim           Sol              Do
To say that we agree and then never change
    Mim   Sol            Lam        Mim    Re
Soften a bit until we all just get along
            Do
But that's disregard
     Mim           Sol              Do
You find another friend and you discard
        Mim          Sol          Do
As you lose the argument in a cable car
     Mim   Sol            Lam    Mim     Re
Hanging above as the canyon comes between


Do    Sol    Mim        Sol
Everyone knows I'm in
Do        Sol     Mim      Re
Over my head, over my head

With eight seconds left in overtime
      Lam       Sol          Mim   Re    Do
She's on your mind, she's on your mind


       Do          Mim       Sol           Do
And suddenly I become a part of your past
       Mim          Sol              Do
I'm becoming the part that don't last
      Mim    Sol            Lam
I'm losing you and its effortless


Do                        Mim            Sol
Without a sound we lose sight of the ground 
         Do
In the throw around
         Mim              Sol         Do
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
        Mim         Sol            Lam
I won't let it go down till we torch it ourselves
