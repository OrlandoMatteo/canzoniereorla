Step one you say we need to talk
    Mim                 Re        Re/Fa#    Sol
He walks you say sit down it’s just a talk
             Re/Fa#           Mim
He smiles politely back at you
             Re       Re/Fa#      Sol
You stare politely right on through
               Re/Fa#          Mim
Some sort of window to your right
             Re       Re/Fa#      Sol
As he goes left and you stay right
              Re/Fa#             Mim
Between the lines of fear and blame
                   Re     Re/Fa#
And you begin to wonder why you came


  Do             Re                Mim
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
            Sol             Re/Fa#
Somewhere along in the bitterness
    Do                   Re                Mim
And I would have stayed up with you all night
             Sol     Re/Fa#     Sol
Had I known how to save a life

Sol                 Re/Fa#
Let him know that you know best
       Mim           Re        Re/Fa#
Cause after all you do know best
Sol                  Re/Fa#
  Try to slip past his defense
Mim               Re        Re/Fa#
Without granting innocence
Sol             Re/Fa#             Mim
   Lay down a list of what is wrong
             Re        Re/Fa#
The things you’ve told him all along
Sol                   Re/Fa#
And pray to God he hears you
    Mim             Re        Re/Fa#
And pray to God he hears you


  Do             Re                Mim
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
            Sol             Re/Fa#
Somewhere along in the bitterness
    Do                   Re                Mim
And I would have stayed up with you all night
             Sol     Re/Fa#    Sol
Had I known how to save a life

    Sol            Re/Fa#
As he begins to raise his voice
     Mim              Re       Re/Fa#          Sol
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
                 Re/Fa#
Drive until you lose the road
    Mim             Re           Re/Fa#
Or break with the ones you’ve followed
Sol             Re/Fa#
   He will do one of two things
Mim            Re   Re/Fa#
He will admit to everything
Sol                     Re/Fa#
Or he’ll say he’s just not the same
     Mim             Re/Fa#
And you’ll begin to wonder why you came
