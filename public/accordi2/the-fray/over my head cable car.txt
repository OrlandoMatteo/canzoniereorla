I never knew
  Fam7            Sol#            Do#maj9
I never knew that everything was falling through
     Fam7       Sol#              Do#
That everyone I knew was waiting on a cue
   Fam7     Sol#            La#m   Sol#     Re#
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
                    Do#maj9
But that's how it's got to be
     Fam7           Sol#               Do#
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
    Fam7           Sol#            Do#maj9
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
    Fam7      Sol#         La#m7    Sol#     Re#
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears and

Do# Sol#  Fam       Sol#
Everyone knows I'm in
Do#     Sol#
Over my head
Fam     Re#7sus4
Over my head
     Do#   Sol#             Fam Sol#
With eight seconds left in overtime

She's on your mind

She's on   your    mind

      Do#maj9
Let's rearrange
  Fam7            Sol#              Do#maj9
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
     Fam7        Sol#            Do#add9
Just say that we agree and then never change
  Fam7   Sol#          La#m7    Sol#  Re#
Soften a bit until we all just get along
           Do#maj9
But that's disregard
    Fam7         Sol#             Do#maj9
You find another friend and you discard
       Fam7         Sol#       Do#maj9
As you lose the argument in a cable car
    Fam7  Sol#        La#m   Sol#     Re#
Hanging above as the canyon comes between and

    Do#maj9      Fam7        Sol#     Do#
And suddenly I become a part of your past
      Fam7       La#m7          Do#
I'm becoming the part that don't last
      Fam7  Sol#        La#m9
I'm losing you and its effortless

  Do#maj9               Fam7         Sol#
Without a sound we lose sight of the ground
       Do#
In the throw around
       Fam7            Sol#        Do#
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
        Fam7       Sol#         La#m    7
I won't let it go down till we torch it ourselves and
