       Remaj7                  Sim9
When I met you, you were so unique
    Solmaj7                          Sim9
You had a little thing I'd love to keep
          Remaj7                     Sim7
And every movement carried much mystique
  Solmaj7
I knew right then I'd carry on
   Sim9
To you I knew my heart belonged

        Remaj7             Sim9
So know you, you give me something
Solmaj7                          Sim7
Something that nobody else can give
       Remaj7          Sim9
And my heart started thumpin'
             Solmaj7                          Sim9
You know now you're the one I truly know I dig

         Remaj7                    Sim9
Like the sunbeams from a perfect summer day
Solmaj7                     Sim9
Heaven only seems a step away
         Remaj7               Sim9
When I'm with you I just celebrate
    Solmaj7
I'm hoping my message gets through
Sim9
There's never been someone like you
Remaj7    Sim7
I had nobody
    Solmaj7      Sim9
But on you I'd lean
       Remaj7          Sim7
'Cause you got these little things
      Solmaj7               Sim9
That I, I know I've never seen

             Remaj7             Sim9
You know now you, you give me something
Solmaj7                           Sim9
Something that nobody else has got
         Remaj7                 Sim9
And this love, that I've been wanting
             Solmaj7                          Sim9
Oh baby it's turning out to be too fast to stop
             Remaj7              Sim9
You know now ooh, you give me something
Solmaj7                          Sim9
Something that nobody else can give
       Remaj7              Sim9
See my heart has started thumpin'
              Solmaj7                         Sim9
You know babe you're the one I truly know I dig
