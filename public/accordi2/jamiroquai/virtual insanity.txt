Re#m7 Sol#7  Do#9     Fa#maj7
      Ooh,  He - ey, oh
Dom7b5               Simaj7              La#5
What we're living in,    let me tell ya

       Re#m7          Sol#7
It's a wonder man can eat at all
     Do#9                Fa#maj7
When things are big that should be small
Dom7b5           Simaj7
Who can tell what magic spells
La#5         Re#m7
Will be doing for us?
        Re#m7         Sol#7
And I'm giving all my love to this world
Do#9       Fa#maj7
   Only to be told
Dom7b5      Simaj7
I can't see, I can't breathe,
La#5           Re#m7   Fa#maj7
no more will we be
    Sol#7                          Do#9
And nothing's going to change the way we live
     Fa#maj7                 Dom7b5
Cos' we can always take but never give
    Simaj7                        La#5
An' now that things're changing for the worse, see.
Re#m7
    Woah,
Sol#7              Do#9
     It's a crazy world we're living in
Fa#maj7                Dom7b5
     And I just can't see that
        Simaj7           La#5         La#7    Rem7b5
Half of us immersed in sin is all we have to give these

  Simaj7    Rem7b5 Re#m7   Fa#maj7  Sol#7   La#7
  Futures made of virtu - al    insani - ty now
  Simaj7   Rem7b5    Re#m7    Fa#maj7  Sol#7    La#7
  Always seem to be governed by this love we have for
  Simaj7     Rem7b5  Re#m7  Fa#maj7   Sol#7   La#7
  Useless, twisting of the new  techno - logy
      Simaj7            Rem7b5       Re#m7    Fa#maj7 Sol#7
  Oh, now there is no sound, for we all live under- ground

La#7    Re#m7           Sol#7
And I'm thinking what a mess we're in
Do#9               Fa#maj7
Hard to know where to begin
   Dom7b5          Simaj7
If I could slip the sickly ties
     La#5   Rem7b5 Re#m7   Fa#maj7
That earthly man has made
    Sol#7      Do#9   Fa#maj7           Dom7b5
And now every mother can choose the colour
Simaj7          La#5      Rem7b5  Re#m7   Fa#maj7
Of her child, that's not nature's way
     Sol#7                        Do#9
Well that's what they said yesterday
        Fa#maj7                 Dom7b5
There's nothing left to do but pray
  Simaj7                       La#5    Rem7b5  Re#m7   Fa#maj7
I think it's time I found  a new    religion,  wo  - ah,
     Sol#7         Do#9        Fa#maj7
it's so insane to synthesize another strain
        Dom7b5            Simaj7            La#5    Rem7
There's something in these futures that we have  to be told

  Simaj7    Rem7b5 Re#m7   Fa#maj7  Sol#7   La#7
  Futures made of virtu - al    insani - ty now

  Oh, now there is no sound, for we all live under- ground

  Simaj7         Rem7b5   Re#m7 Fa#maj7   Sol#7 La#7
  Now there is no sound, if we all live underground
  Simaj7                  Rem7b5
      And now it's virtual insanity
  Re#m7         Fa#maj7    Sol#7  La#7
    Forget your virtual real - ity
  Simaj7                     Rem7b5  Re#m7  Fa#maj7  Sol#7  La#7
       Oh, there's nothing so bad.
  Simaj7    Rem7b5    Re#m7   Fa#maj7   Sol#7  La#7
                   I know    yeah
