          Mim7
I must've died and gone to heaven
              Fa#m7         Si7b9
'Cause it was quarter past eleven
     Mim7           Fa#m7  Si7b9
On a Saturday in 1999
      Mim7
Right across from where I'm standing
       Fa#m7               Si7b9
On the dance floor she was landing
       Mim7                            Fa#m7  Si7b9
It was clear that she was from another time
          Mim7
Like some baby Barbarella
         Fa#m7            Si7b9
With the stars as her umbrella
    Mim7                         Fa#m7  Si7b9
She asked me if I'd like to magnetize
     Mim7
Do I have to go star-trekking
                Fa#m7        Si7b9
'Cause it's you I should be checking
       Mim7                            Fa#m7 Si7b9
So she laser beamed me with her cosmic eyes

Sol#m7 Fa#m7                    La/Si Do#m
         ...She's just a cosmic girl
             Sol#m7 Fa#m7
From another galaxy
                   La/Si Do#m
My heart's at zero gravity
                    Sol#m7 Fa#m7
She's from a cosmic world
              La/Si  Do#m
Putting me in ecstasy
                   Sol#m7  Fa#m7
Transmitting on my frequency
              La/Si Do#m
She's cosmic

Mim7  Fa#m7 Si7b9    Mim7  Fa#m7 Si7b9

Mim7  Fa#m7 Si7b9    Mim7  Fa#m7 Si7b9

    Mim7
I'm scanning all my radars
         Fa#m7             Si7b9
Well she said she's from a quasar
      Mim7                         Fa#m7  Si7b9
Forty thousand million light years away
       Mim7
It's a distant solar system
         Fa#m7                Si7b9
Tried to phone but they don't list 'em
     Mim7                             Fa#m7  Si7b9
So I asked her for her number all the same
           Mim7
She said, "step in my transporter
   Fa#m7    Si7b9
So I can teleport ya
Mim7                   Fa#m7 Si7b9
All around my heavenly body"
               Mim7
Oh, This could be a close encounter
         Fa#m7            Si7b9
I should take care not to flounder
Mim7
Sends me into hyperspace
Fa#m7          Si7b9
when I see her pretty face

Sol#m7 Fa#m7                    La/Si Do#m
         ...She's just a cosmic girl
             Sol#m7 Fa#m7
From another galaxy
                   La/Si Do#m
My heart's at zero gravity
                    Sol#m7 Fa#m7
She's from a cosmic world
              La/Si  Do#m
Putting me in ecstasy
                   Sol#m7  Fa#m7
Transmitting on my frequency
              La/Si Do#m
She's cosmic

Sol#m7        Fa#m7
Sends me into hyperspace

when I see her pretty face...
La/Si         Do#m
Sends me into hyperspace

when I see her pretty face...
Sol#m7        Fa#m7
Sends me into hyperspace

when I see her pretty face...
La/Si         Do#m
Sends me into hyperspace

when I see her pretty face...

Sol#m7 Fa#m7                    La/Si Do#m
         ...She's just a cosmic girl
             Sol#m7 Fa#m7
From another galaxy
                   La/Si   Do#m
Transmitting on my frequency
              Sol#m7 Fa#m7
Yeah cosmic, oh
                           La/Si Do#m
Can't you be my cosmic woman?
                    Sol#m7 Fa#m7
I need you, I want you
                                    La/Si Do#m
To be my cosmic girl, for the rest of time
                    Sol#m7 Fa#m7
Oh, I'm loosing my love
                    La/Si Do#m
Oh, my cosmic girl yeah
                    Sol#m7 Fa#m7
She, Incomprehensible
