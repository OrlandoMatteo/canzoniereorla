And I never thought I'd feel this way, and as far as I’m concerned
           Sol7sus4  Sol7      Dom7       Sol#          Sol#6/La#
I'm glad I got the chance to say that I do believe I love you

And if  I should ever go  away, well then close your eyes and try
            Sol7sus4 Sol7  Dom7         Sol#          Sol#6/La#
To feel the way we do  today and then if you can remember

(Well you) came and opened me
                Sol7sus4  Sol7   Dom7        Sol#          Sol#6/La#
And now there's so much more I see, and so by the way I thank you
    Re#          Solm7      Dom7    Fam7
And then for the times when we're apart
                              Rem7b5
Well then close your eyes and know
