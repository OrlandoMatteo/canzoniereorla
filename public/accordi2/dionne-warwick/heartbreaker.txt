Mi
 I got to say it and it's hard for me
Do#m7
 You got me crying like I thought I would never be
Fa#m7
 Love is believing, but you let me down
                           Si
How can I love you when you ain't around
     Mi
And I get to the morning and you never call
 Do#m7
Love should be everything or not at all
Fa#m7
 And it don't matter whatever you do
                    Si
I made a life out of loving you
Sol#m7   Do#m     Sol#m7       Do#m     Sol#m7
Only to find any dream that I follow is dying
    Fa#m7  Si     Sol#m7
I'm crying in the rain
            Do#m         Sol#m7      Do#m    Sol#m7
I could be searching my world for a love everlasting
Lamaj7
Feeling no pain
          Lam
When will we meet again

Mi                      Fa#m7  Si
 Why do you have to be a  heartbreaker
Sol#m7                La     Si
 Is it a lesson that I never knew
Sol#m7      Do#m       Sol#m7         Do#m
Got to get out of the spell that I'm under
La            Sol#m7   Si
  My love for you
Mi                      Fa#m7  Si
 Why do you have to be a  heartbreaker
Sol#m7                     La         Si
 When I was being what you want me to be
Sol#m7     Do#m       Sol#m7 Do#m
Suddenly, everything I ever wanted
La              Sol#m7
  Has passed me by
               Fa#m7
This world may end
            Mi
Not you and I

Mi
 My love is stronger than the universe
 Do#m7
My soul is crying for you and that cannot be reversed
Fa#m7
 You made the rules and you could not see
                      Si
You made a life out of hurting me
Sol#m7     Do#m       Sol#m7      Do#m    Sol#m7
Out of my mind, I am held by the power of you, love
        Lamaj7
Tell me when do we try
          Lam
Or should we say goodbye

Mi                      Fa#m7  Si
 Why do you have to be a  heartbreaker
Sol#m7                     La         Si
 When I was being what you want me to be
Sol#m7     Do#m       Sol#m7 Do#m
Suddenly, everything I ever wanted
La              Sol#m7
  Has passed me by

Sol#m   Do#m Sol#m  Fa# Mi  Si6/Do#

Fa#                     Sol#m7 Do#
 Why do you have to be a  heartbreaker
La#m7                 Si      Do#
 Is it a lesson that I never knew
La#m7      Re#m       La#m7  Re#m
Suddenly, everything I ever wanted
Si            La#m7   Do#7sus4
  My love for you
Fa#                     Sol#m7 Do#
 Why do you have to be a  heartbreaker
La#m7                      Si         Do#
 When I was being what you want me to be
La#m7      Re#m       La#m7  Re#m
Suddenly, everything I ever wanted
Si              La#m7
  Has passed me by...
