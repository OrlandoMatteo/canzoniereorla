  Re                 Sim
You looked inside my fantasies
    Sol               Readd9/Fa#
And made each one come true
Solmaj7            La9       La/Sol Fa#m7        Sim
Something no one else had ever  found a way to do
     Mim7              Readd9/Fa#
I've kept the memories one by one
Solmaj7              Sol6
Since you took me in
Sol6/La                            Re
I know I'll never love this way again

I know I'll never love this way again
   Fa#7/La# Sim       Mi9          Sol/La La/Sol Re/Fa#
So I keep   holding on  before the good is    gone
Mim7 Re       Sim7   Mim7          La7sus4
I   know I'll never love this way again

A fool will lose tomorrow
         Sol          Readd9/Fa#
Reaching back for yesterday
  Solmaj7         La9         La/Sol
I won't turn my head in sorrow
   Fa#m7          Sim7
If you should go away
     Mim7           Readd9/Fa#
I'll stand here and remember
Solmaj7               Sol6
Just how good it's been
