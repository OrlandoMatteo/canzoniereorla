I played the ones you know
  Fa+
I took you all the way
                La#m     La#
But that was yesterday
  Fa#maj7
I wore your favorite clothes
  Fa+
I said the things you'd say
         La#madd9    La#/Re
That was yesterday

          Re#m9
So if you loved me so much
                             Fa#9Â 
Why'd you go? (Why'd you go?)
La#m
Keep yourself back
                Fa#maj7
Keep on lying, oh
             Fa+         La#m
I can only be what I am
   
Dive in, smiling

                Fa#maj7
Life is not the same
         Fa+ Fa   La#m  La#/Re
If we're miles away
           Fa#maj7
I was your champion
      Fa+   Fa          La#m  La#/Re
I did everything your way

   Fa#maj7
We both swim out to sea
    Fa+
You lost me willingly
             La#m
But that was yesterday
          La#
(That was yesterday)
    Fa#maj7
You knew it would get dark
    Fa+
You made sure I would need you
   La#m        La#/Re
In every way

          Re#m9
So if you loved me so much
          La#4/Fa#
Why'd you go? (Why'd you go?)
Do#                    La#7sus4
   Keep yourself back
