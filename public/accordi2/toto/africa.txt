Si                   Re#m     Sol#m
I hear the drums echoing tonight
Si/Fa#              La/Mi         Do#m      Sol#m   La Sol#m Do#m
She hears only whispers of some quiet conversa - tion
Si                 Re#m           Sol#m
She's coming in, twelve thirty flight
Si/Fa#              La/Mi                 Do#m7          Sol#m   La Sol#m Do#m
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me toward salva-tion
Si              Re#m             Sol#m
I stopped an old man along the way
Si/Fa#                La/Mi            Do#m         Sol#m   La Sol#m Do#m
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melo-dies
Si              Re#m       Sol#m                  La                Do#m
He turned to me as if to say “hurry boy, it's waiting there for you”


Fa#m          Re               La        Mi
Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
Fa#m                     Re             La               Mi
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
Fa#m          Re           La   Mi
I bless the rains down in  Africa
Fa#m             Re               La             Do#m Mi Fa#m Mi La
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had...

Ooo Ooo

Si             Re#m            Sol#m
The wild dogs cry out in the night
Si/Fa#               La/Mi             Do#m     Sol#m   La Sol#m Do#m
As they grow restless longing for some solitary compa-ny
Si           Re#m              Sol#m
I know that I must do what's right
Si/Fa#                   La/Mi        Do#m       Sol#m    La Sol#m Do#m
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
Si         Re#m                Sol#m
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Sol#m                La                   Do#m
Frightened of this thing that I've become


     Fa#m          Re               La        Mi
It’s gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
