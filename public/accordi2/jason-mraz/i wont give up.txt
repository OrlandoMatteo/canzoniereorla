When I look into your eyes, It's like watching the night sky,
             Re4  Re                        La4  La
Or a beautiful sunrise. There's so much they hold.
                 Re4   Re                     Re4     Re
And just like them old stars, I see that you've come so far,
                Re4  Re                   La4  La
To be right where you are. How old is your soul?


             Sol     Re                 Sim       La
I won't give up on us, even if the skies get rough.
               Sol       Re                     La4  La
I'm giving you all my love. I'm still looking up.

And when you're needing your space, to do some navigating,
            Re4       Re                       La4  La
I'll be here patiently waiting, to see what you find.


                  Sol         Re               Sim          La
'Cause even the stars they burn. Some even fall to the earth.
             Sol      Re                    La4     La
We've got a lot to learn. God knows we're worth it.

No, I won't give up.

I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily,
                                              La
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make.
    Mim
Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use
                                            La
the tools and gifts we got, yeah, we got a lot at stake.
           Do
And in the end you're still my friend, at least we did intend

for us to work, we didn't break, we didn't burn.

     We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in.
Do                          Do#dim              N.C.      Re
  I had to learn what I got, and what I'm not and who I am.


             Sol     Re                 Sim       La
I won't give up on us, even if the skies get rough.
               Sol       Re                     Sim7
I'm giving you all my love. I'm still looking up.
              La
Still looking up.

I won't give up on us (no I'm not... giving up)
               Sim     La
God knows I'm tough enough (I am tough... I am loved)
             Sol      Re
We've got a lot to learn (we're alive... we are loved)
                 La
God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it)
