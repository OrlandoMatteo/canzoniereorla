Now do ya hear me talking to you
           Rem7                Sol        Mi7
Across the water, across the deep blue ocean
           Lam         Rem7
Under the open sky, oh my
          Sol
Baby I'm trying


      Do                Lam
Boy I hear you in my dreams
            Rem7                Sol        
I feel your whisper across the sea
           Mi7            Lam
I keep you with me in my heart
            Rem7         Sol         Sol#dim
You make it easier when life gets hard


Lam           Rem7                Sol
Lucky I'm in love with my best friend

Rem7                 Lam            Sol
They don't know how long it takes
              Rem7
Waiting for a love like this
              Lam          Sol              Rem7
Every time we say goodbye, I wish we had one more kiss
                     Lam              Sol   Lam7 Do/Si  
I'll wait for you, I promise you, I will

And so I'm sailing, through the sea
      Rem7              Sol
To an island, where we'll meet
                Mi7              Lam
You'll hear the music, fill the air
        Rem7    Sol
I put a flower in you hair


               Do                   Lam
And though the breezes through the trees
        Rem7                  Sol
Move so pretty, you're all I see
        Mi7                  Lam
As the world keep spinning round
    Rem7            Sol
You hold me right here, right now
