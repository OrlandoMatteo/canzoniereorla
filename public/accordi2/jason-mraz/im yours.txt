[<pre>Sol   Re   Mim   Do

     Sol
Well you done done me an' you bet I felt it
  Re
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
  Mim
I fell right through the cracks
            Do
And now I'm tryin' to get back

           Sol
Before the cool done run out, I'll be givin it my bestest
    Re
and nothin's gonna stop me but divine intervention
  Mim
I reckon it's again my turn
   Do
To win some or learn some

    Sol           Re
But I won't hesitate
            Mim
No more, no more
          Do            Sol   Re   Mim   Do
It cannot wait; I'm yours


Sol                                    Re
Well, open up your mind and see like me
                                   Mim
Open up your plans and damn you're free
                                     Do
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love

Sol                                               Re                                Mim
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family
                                      Do                           La7
And it's our god-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved


Sol              Re  Re4
So I won't hesitate
            Mim
No more, no more
          Do
It cannot wait, I'm sure
           Sol             Re 
There's no need to complicate
            Mim
Our time is short
            Do
This is our fate,
         Sol
I'm yours


Sol                     Re             Mim
Doo do do doo doo do, doo do doo do doo do
                       Re               Do
Do you want to come on, scooch on over closer, dear
                       La7
And I will nibble your ear

| Sol  Sim  | Mim  Re  | Do     | La7    |


                   Sol
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
    Re
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
    Mim
But my breath fogged up the glass
         Do
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
  Sol
I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
   Re
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
   Mim
It's what we aim to do
    Do
Our name is our virtue


    Sol           Re Re4
But I won't hesitate
            Mim
No more, no more
          Do            Sol
It cannot wait; I'm yours
                                     Re
Well, open up your mind and see like me
             Re                      Mim
Open up your plans and damn you're free
                                         Do
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
   Sol
So please don't, please don't, please don't
           Re        Re4
There's no need to complicate
           Mim
'Cause our time is short
                              Do
This oh, this oh, this is our fate
        La7
I'm yours</pre>]
