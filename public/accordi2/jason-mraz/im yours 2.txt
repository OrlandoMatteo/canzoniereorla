       Si  Fa#  Sol#m  Mi

      Si
Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
  Fa#
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
  Sol#m
I fell right through the cracks
        Mi
Now I'm trying to get back
           Si
Before the cool done run out

I'll be giving it my bestest
    Fa#
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
  Sol#m
I reckon, it's again my turn
   Mi
To win some or learn some
    Si          Fa#
But I won't hesitate
            Sol#m
No more, no more
          Mi            Si  Fa#  Sol#m  Mi
It cannot wait,  I'm yours

Si                                     Fa#
 Well, open up your mind and see like me,
                                    Sol#m
Open up your plans and damn you're free
                                     Mi
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love
Si
Listen to the music of the moment,
                   Fa#                         Sol#m
people dance and sing, we're just one big family

And it's our God-forsaken right
      Mi                          Do#7/Fa
to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved

   Si          Fa#
So I won't hesitate
            Sol#m
No more, no more
          Mi
It cannot wait,  I'm sure
           Si            Fa#
There's no need to complicate
            Sol#m
Our time is short
            Mi
This is our fate   I'm yours

Si  Fa#/La#  Sol#m

                      Fa#                  Mi
Do you want to come on, scooch on over closer, dear
                       Do#7/Fa
And I will nibble your ear

Si  Fa#/La#  Sol#m  Fa#  Mi    Do#7/Fa

                   Si
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
    Fa#
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
     Sol#m
But my breath fogged up the glass
         Mi
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
  Si
I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
   Fa#
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
    Sol#m
It's what we aim to do
    Mi
Our name is our virtue

    Si          Fa#
But I won't hesitate
            Sol#m
No more, no more
          Mi
It cannot wait,  I'm yours
    Si                                Fa#
Well, open up your mind and see like me,
                                    Sol#m
Open up your plans and damn you're free
                                        Mi
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
   Si
So please don't, please don't, please don't...
           Fa#
There's no need to complicate
            Sol#m
'Cause our time is short
                              Mi
This oh, this oh, this is our fate
           Do#7/Fa
I'm yours
