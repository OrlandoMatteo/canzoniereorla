        La/Mi Mi     La/Mi Mi

        La/Mi Mi     Si4  Si

                 La/Mi Mi
When I look into your  eyes
                       La/Mi Mi
It's like watching the night sky
               La/Mi Mi
Or a beautiful sun--rise
                           Si4   Si
Well, there's so much they hold
                   La/Mi Mi
And just like them old  stars
                  La/Mi   Mi
I see that you've come so far
                  La/Mi Mi
To be right where you  are
                Si4    Si
How old is your soul?

                   La    Mi
Well, I won't give up on us
            Do#m7     Si
Even if the skies get rough
               La     Mi
I'm giving you all my love
                  Si4   Si
I'm still looking up

                        La/Mi Mi
And when you're needing your  space
           La/Mi Mi
To do some navigating
             La/Mi     Mi
I'll be here patiently waiting
                Si4   Si
To see what you find

                La         Mi
'Cause even the stars they burn
          Do#m7       Si
Some even fall to the earth
            La     Mi
We've got a lot to learn
                Si4      Si
God knows we're worth it
                 Lamaj7  La6  Lamaj7  La6
No, I won't give up
        Fa#m7
I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
                                              Si4        Si
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
    Fa#m7
Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use

The tools and gifts we got, yeah,
         Si4          Si
we got a lot at stake
           Re
And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend
                                               Si7/Re#
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
                                                        Re
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
                             Si7/Re#
I had to learn what I've got, and what I'm not,
          Mi  Mi4  Mi
and who I am

             La    Mi
I won't give up on us
            Do#m7     Si
Even if the skies get rough
               La     Mi
I'm giving you all my love
                  Do#m7                 Si
I'm still looking up, I'm still looking up
                   La    Mi
Well, I won't give up on us (no I'm not giving up)
              Do#m7   Si
God knows I'm tough enough (I am tough, I am loved)
            La     Mi
We've got a lot to learn (we're alive, we are loved)
                Si4                         Si
God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it)
             La    Mi
I won't give up on us
            Do#m7     Si
Even if the skies get rough
               La     Mi
I'm giving you all my love
                  Si
I'm still looking up
