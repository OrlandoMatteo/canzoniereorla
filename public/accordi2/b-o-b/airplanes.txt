Can we pretend that airplanes
         Mim
In the night sky
             Do            Sol
Are like shooting stars
                    Mim            Mim             Do           Sol
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
                       Mim
Can we pretend that airplanes
         Mim
In the night sky
             Do            Sol
Are like shooting stars
                    Mim            Mim             Do           Sol
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)


Mim
I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
   Do                       Sol
To go back to a place much simpler than this
      Mim
Cause after all the partyin’ and smashin’ and crashin’
Do                           Sol
 And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
 
Mim
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
Do                              Sol
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
Mim
And when you’re staring at that phone in your lap
        Do                            Sol
And you hoping but them people never call you back

Mim
But that’s just how the story unfolds
    Do                     Sol
You get another hand soon after you fold
Mim
And when your plans unravel in the sand
                Do           Sol
What would you wish for if you had one chance?

Mim
So airplane, airplane, sorry I'm late
    Do                   Sol
I'm on my way so don't close that gate
   Mim
If I don’t make that then I’ll switch my flight
    Do                               Sol
And I’ll be right back at it by the end of the night

         Mim
In the night sky
             Do            Sol
Are like shooting stars
                   Mim             Mim             Do            Sol
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)

         Mim
Somebody take me back to the days
                  Do                 Sol
Before this was a job, before I got paid
               Mim
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
                     Do                         Sol
Yeah back when I was tryin’ to get a tip at subway

                    Mim
And back when I was rappin’ for the hell of it
                  Do                       Sol
But now a days we rappin’ to stay relevant
                            Mim
I’m guessin that if we can make some wishes outta airplanes
              Do                         Sol
Then maybe yo maybe I’ll go back to the days

             Mim
Before the politics that we call the rap game
                      Do                       Sol
And back when ain’t nobody listened to my mix tape
                  Mim
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
                     Do                      Sol
But this is for the hater, what's up Bobby Ray

               Mim
So can I get a wish to end the politics
                    Do                       Sol
And get back to the music that started this shit
           Mim
So here I stand and then again I say
                  Do                          Sol
I’m hopin’ we can make some wishes outta' airplanes
