        Mi

Mi
 Dark in the city, night is a wire

Steam in the subway, earth is afire
      Re                          Mi
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo

Woman, you want me, give me a sign

And catch my breathing even closer behind
      Re                          Mi
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo

Do                 Sol
 In touch with the ground
           Fa              La#add9
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
             Do                   Sol
Smell like I sound, I'm lost in a crowd
        Fa              Re
And I'm hungry like the wolf
             Do                  Sol
Straddle the line in discord and rhyme
           Fa              La#add9
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
          Do                    Sol
Mouth is alive with juices like wine
        Fa              Re    Mim
And I'm hungry like the wolf

Mi
 Stalked in the forest, too close to hide

I'll be upon you by the moonlight side
      Re                          Mi
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo

High blood drumming on your skin, it's so tight

You feel my heat, I'm just a moment behind
      Re
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo

Do                 Sol
 In touch with the ground
           Fa              La#add9
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
            Do                      Sol
Scent and a sound, I'm lost and I'm found
        Fa              Re
And I'm hungry like the wolf
           Do                     Sol
Strut on a line, it's discord and rhyme
             Fa               La#add9
I howl and I whine, I'm after you
          Do                  Sol
Mouth is alive, all running inside
        Fa              Re     Mim
And I'm hungry like the wolf

Mim
Hungry like the wolf

Hungry like the wolf

Hungry like the wolf

            Do                       Sol
Burning the ground, I break from the crowd
           Fa              La#add9
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
               Do                      Sol
I smell like I sound, I'm lost and I'm found
        Fa              Re
And I'm hungry like the wolf
           Do                     Sol
Strut on a line, it's discord and rhyme
           Fa              La#add9
I'm on the hunt, I'm after you
          Do                    Sol
Mouth is alive with juices like wine
        Fa              Re
And I'm hungry like the wolf

            Do                       Sol
