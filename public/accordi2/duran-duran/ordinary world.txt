Do#m7
Came in from a rainy thursday
Mi            Fa#4
on the avenue
Do#m7                              Mi   Fa#4
thought I heard you talking softly
Do#m7
I turned on the lights, the tv
Mi            Fa#4
and the radio
Do#m                              Mi   Fa#4
still I can't escape the ghost of you

Do#m
What is happened to it all?
Sol#m7
Crazy, some say
Re#m7                        Mi    Fa#4
Where is the life that I recognize? Gone away

Si                          Fa#m7
  But I won't cry for yesterday
                    Readd9
there's an ordinary world
        La/Do#    Mi
somehow I have to find
Si                        Fa#m7
  And as I try to make my way
                Readd9
to the ordinary world
       La/Do#      Do6
I will learn to survive


     Do#m  La/Do#  Fa#/Do#

Do#m7
Passion or coincidence
     Mi                  Fa#4
once prompted you to say
Do#m                            Mi   Fa#4
"Pride will tear us both apart"
           Do#m
Well now pride's gone out the window
          Mi            Fa#4
cross the rooftops, runaway
Do#m                          Mi    Fa#4
  left me in the vacuum of my heart

Do#m
What is happening to me?
Sol#m7
Crazy, some say
Re#m7                     Mi          Fa#4
Where is my friend when I need you most? Gone away

Si                          Fa#m7
  But I won't cry for yesterday
                    Readd9
there's an ordinary world
        La/Do#    Mi
somehow I have to find
Si                        Fa#m7
  And as I try to make my way
                Readd9
to the ordinary world
       La/Do#      Mi7
I will learn to survive


     Si  Fa#m7  Readd9  La/Do#  Mi

     Si  Fa#m7  Readd9  La/Do#  Do6

Do#m7                          Mi               Fa#4
Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed
Do#m7                        Mi   Fa#4
Fear today, forgot tomorrow
Do#m7                      Mi           Fa#4
  Besides the news of holy war and holy need
Do#m7                          Mi   Fa#4
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk

Si                          Fa#m7
  But I won't cry for yesterday
                    Readd9

to the ordinary world
       La/Do#      Mi7
I will learn to survive
      Si    Fa#m7       Readd9
Every world...... is my world
        La/Do#      Mi7
(I will learn to survive)
    Si    Fa#m7       Readd9
Any world...... is my world
        La/Do#      Mi7
(I will learn to survive)
    Si    Fa#m7       Readd9
Any world...... is my world...
