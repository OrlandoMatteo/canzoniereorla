        Dom  La#6 La#  Sol#6 Sol#  La#

        Dom  Re#  Sol#  La#

Dom     La#6      La#       Sol#6       Sol#
Mine, immaculate dream made breath and skin
          La#
I've been waiting for you
Dom           La#6    La#
Signed with a home tattoo,
      Sol#6        Sol#        La#
Happy Birthday to You was created for you
Dom                               La#4    La#
Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams
Sol#                                  La#
Can't I believe you're taking my heart to pieces
Dom       La#6          La#
Oh, it'll take a little time,
      Sol#6          Sol#
Might take a little crime
   La#
To come undone now
Sol#
We'll try to stay blind
Sol4            Sol
To the hope and fear outside
Fam7             La#9   Solm7
Hey, child, stay wilder than the wind
    La#           Dom
And blow me in to cry

Re#              Sol#
Who do you need, who do you love
La#              Dom
 When you come undone?
Re#              Sol#
Who do you need, who do you love
La#              Dom
 When you come undone?

Dom            La#6    La#
Words, playing me deja vu
       Sol#6   Sol#   La#
Like a radio tune I swear I've heard before
Dom       La#6         La#
Chill, is it something real
       Sol#6       Sol#    La#
Or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers?
Dom                               La#4      La#
Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams
Sol#                                La#
Can I believe you're taking my heart to pieces?
Dom       La#6        La#
Lost in a snow filled sky,
      Sol#6      Sol#
We'll make it alright
   La#
To come undone now
Sol#
We'll try to stay blind
Sol4            Sol
To the hope and fear outside
Fam7             La#9   Solm
Hey, child, stay wilder than the wind
    La#           Dom
And blow me in to cry...

Re#              Sol#
Who do you need, who do you love
La#              Dom
 When you come undone?
Re#              Sol#
Who do you need, who do you love
La#              Dom
 When you come undone?
