       Do#m  Si  Fa#  Do#m  Si

Do#m                  Si        Fa#       Do#m
Once was a man who consumed his place and time
                         Si        Fa#
He thought nothing could touch him
Do#m                    Si         Fa#  Do#m
But here and now it’s a different storyline
                      Si       Fa#
Like the straw he is clutching
Mi                     Sol#m
Why has the sky turned grey
Do#m7               Sol#m
Hard to my face and cold on my shoulder
    Mi                   Sol#m
And why has my life gone astray
Do#m7                  Si            Laadd9
Scarred by disgrace, I know that its over

  Do#m       Mi     Si    Fa#
Because I’m falling down
     Do#m   Mi       Si    Fa#
With people standing round
     Do#m    Mi      Si
But before I hit the ground
         Fa#
Is there time Could
  Do#m         Mi            Si     Fa#  Do#m7  Si
I find someone out there to help me?

Do#m                     Si      Fa#    Do#m
Howl at the wind rushing past my lonely head
                      Si    Fa#
Caught inside its own motion
Do#m                  Si        Fa#
How I wish it was somebody else instead
Do#m                   Si     Fa#
Howling at all this corrosion
Mi                   Sol#m
Why did the luck run dry
Do#m7                 Sol#m
Laugh in my face, so pleased to desert me
Mi                     Sol#m
Why do the cruel barbs fly?
Do#m7                 Si        Laadd9
Now when disgrace can no longer hurt me

  Do#m       Mi     Si    Fa#
Because I’m falling down
     Do#m   Mi       Si    Fa#
With people standing round
     Do#m    Mi      Si
But before I hit the ground
         Fa#
Is there time Could
  Do#m         Mi           Si     Fa#
I find someone out there to help me?

Mi  Sol#m  Do#m  Si La

  Do#m       Mi     Si    Fa#
Because I’m falling down
     Do#m   Mi       Si    Fa#
With people standing round
     Do#m    Mi      Si
But before I hit the ground
         Fa#
Is there time Could
  Do#m
I find someone out there to help me?
        Do#m  Mi  Si  Fa#
I don’t know…

Do#m  Mi  Si  Fa#
        Do#m  Mi  Si  Fa#
I don’t know…

Do#m  Mi  Si  Fa#

Do#m  Mi  Si  Fa#   Do#m  Mi  Si  Fa#
