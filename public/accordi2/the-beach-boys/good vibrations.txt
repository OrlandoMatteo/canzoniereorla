 I, I love the colourful clothes she wears,
        Si6                             La#7
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
Re#m                  Do#6
I hear the sound of a gentle word,
       Si6                 Do#                 La#7  Do#7
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air

Close my eyes; she's somehow closer now,
Si            Do#                La#7
Softly smile; I know she must be kind
Re#m           Do#6
When... I look in her eyes,
         Si           Do#           La#7 Do#7
She goes with me to a blossom world
