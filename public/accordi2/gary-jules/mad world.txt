Mim                     Sol
   All around me are familiar faces
Re                La
Worn out places, worn out faces
Mim                            Sol
   Bright and early for their daily races
Re              La
Going nowhere, going nowhere
Mim                         Sol
   Their tears are filling up their glasses
Re              La
No expression, no expression
Mim                         Sol
   Hide my head, I want to drown my sorrow
Re            La
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

   And I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad
                        La                            Mim
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
                  La                           Mim
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take
                   La
When people run in circles, it's a very, very
Mim      La
   Mad world

Mim                          Sol
   Children waiting for the day they feel good
Re               La
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Mim                           Sol
   Made to feel the way that every child should
Re               La
Sit and listen, sit and listen
Mim                           Sol
   Went to school, and I was very nervous
Re               La
No one knew me, no one knew me
Mim                         Sol
   Hello, teacher, tell me what's my lesson
Re                      La
Look right through me, look right through me
