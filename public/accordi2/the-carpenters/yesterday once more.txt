When I was young
                  Sol#m/Re#
I'd listen to the radio
        Do#m            Do#m/Si
Waitin' for my favorite songs
          Lamaj7              Sol#m7
When they played I'd sing along
   Fadim   Fa#m7   Si/Re#  La/Si
It made me smile
                Mi
Those were such happy times
           Sol#m/Re#
And not so long ago
      Do#m     Do#m/Si      Lamaj7
How I wondered where they'd gone
Re#m7b5 Sol#7   Do#m
But      they're back again
            Do#m/Si
Just like a long lost friend
        La      Fa#m7    Si7sus4
All the songs I loved so well

La/Si Si7 Mi
E---very  Sha-la-la-la
      Do#m
Every Wo-o-wo-o
      Mi      Do#m
Still shines
      Mi
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
             Do#m
That they're startin' to sing's
   Fa#m7    Si
So fine
          Do#m
When they get to the part
           Sol#/Do
Where he's breakin' her heart
       Mi/Si          La#m7b5
It can really make me cry
            Mi/Si   La/Si
Just like before
                  Mimaj7   La6/Mi
It's yesterday once more...

Mimaj7    La6/Si

        Mi
Lookin' back on how it was
   Sol#m/Re#
In years gone by
        Do#m              Do#m/Si
And the good times that I had
        Lamaj7            Sol#m7
Makes today seem rather sad
            Fa#m7    La/Si Si7
So much has changed
       Mi
It was songs of love that
        Sol#m/Re#
I would sing to then
        Do#m Do#m/Si  Lamaj7
And I'd memorize each word
Re#m7b5 Sol#7 Do#m
Those    old   melodies
               Do#m/Si
Still sound so good to me
        La       Fa#m7  Si7sus4
As they melt the years away

La/Si Si7  Mi
E---very   Sha-la-la-la
      Do#m
Every Wo-o-wo-o
      Mi      Do#m
Still shines
      Mi
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
             Do#m
That they're startin' to sing's
   Fa#m7    Si
So fine
          Do#m
When they get to the part
           Sol#/Do
Where he's breakin' her heart
       Mi/Si          La#m7b5
It can really make me cry
            Mi/Si   La/Si
Just like before
                  Mimaj7   La6/Mi
It's yesterday once more
Si7   Mi
Every Sha-la-la-la
      Do#m
Every Wo-o-wo-o
      Mi      Do#m
Still shines
      Mi
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
             Do#m
That they're startin' to sing's
   Fa#m7    Si
So fine
La/Si Si7  Mi
E---very   Sha-la-la-la
      Do#m
Every Wo-o-wo-o
      Mi      Do#m
Still shines
      Mi
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
             Do#m
That they're startin' to sing's
   Fa#m7    Si
So fine...
