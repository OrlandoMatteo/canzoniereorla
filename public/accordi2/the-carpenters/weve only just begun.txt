 We've only just begun  to live
               Sim7     Fa#m
White lace and promises
                    Sim7         Re/Mi  Mi
A kiss for luck and we're on our way
             Lamaj7
We've only begun
                Remaj7    Do#m7  Fa#m
Before the rising sun we fly
        Sim7           Fa#m
So many roads to choose
                         Sim7       Mi7sus4
We start out walking and learn to run
                      Lamaj7  Remaj7  Lamaj7  Remaj7 Mi Fa#
And yes, we've just begun

         Si               Fa#        Si
Sharing horizons that are new to us
Fa#           Si              Fa#  Si
 Watching the signs along the way
La#         Re#            Simaj7     Re#
 Talking it over just the two of us
La#         Re#          Sim11
 Working together day to day

Together

Lamaj7                 Remaj7      Do#m7  Fa#m
 And when the evening comes we smile
           Sim7       Fa#m
So much of life ahead
                                 Sim7     Mi7sus4 Mi7
We'll find a place where there's room to grow
