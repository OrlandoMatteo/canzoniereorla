Fam    Sol#/Re#   Do#     Sol#/Do
Long ago and oh so far away
       La#7          Do#           Dom
I fell in love with you before the second show
Fam        Sol#/Re#      Do#          Sol#/Do
Your guitar, it sounds so sweet and clear
           La#7         Do#
But you're not really here
              Dom
It's just the radio

Do#                    Dom         La#m     Sol#
Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby
    Do#                  Dom       La#m      Sol#
You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
Do#         Dom   La#m    Sol#
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby,
  Fa#     Do#maj7       Fam  Sol#/Re#  Do#  Sol#/Do
I love you I really do

Loneliness   is  such a sad affair
      La#7         Do#           Dom
And I can hardly wait to be with you again
Fam       Sol#/Re#   Do#         Sol#/Do
What to say to make you come again
        La#7      Do#
Come back to me again
              Dom
And play your sad guitar

Do#                    Dom         La#m     Sol#
Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby
    Do#                  Dom       La#m      Sol#
You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
Do#         Dom   La#m    Sol#
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby,
  Fa#     Sol#
I love you I really do
Do#                    Dom         La#m     Sol#
Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby
    Do#                  Dom       La#m      Sol#
You said you'd be coming back this way again baby

Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby,

I love you I really do
