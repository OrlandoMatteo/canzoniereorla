Sol                        Re
The moon and stars they wept
                     Mim
The morning sun was dead
                    Do
The Savior of the world was fallen
 Sol                Re
His body on the cross
                         Mim
His blood poured out for us
                      Do
The weight of every curse upon Him


Sol   Re   Mim   Do


Sol                    Re
One final breath He gave
                  Mim
As Heaven looked away
                    Do
The Son of God was laid in darkness
Sol                 Re
A battle in the grave
                      Mim
The war on death was waged
                     Do
The power of hell forever broken


Sol                     Re
The ground began to shake
                      Mim
The stone was rolled away
                        Do
His perfect love could not be overcome
Sol/Si                       Re
Now death where is your sting
                 Mim
Our resurrected King 
                    Do
Has rendered you defeated


   Sol               Re
Forever, He is glorified
Mim               Do
Forever, He is lifted high
   Sol             Re
Forever, He is risen
       Mim            Do
He is alive; He is alive
