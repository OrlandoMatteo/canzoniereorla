You know people when you do find that somebody

Hold that woman, hold that man

Love him, hold him, squeeze her, please her, hold her

Squeeze and please that person, give em all your love

Signify your feelings with every gentle caress

Because its so important to have that special somebody

To hold, kiss, miss, squeeze and please
