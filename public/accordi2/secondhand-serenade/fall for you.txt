[<pre>    Lam                                        Fa
The best thing about tonight’s that we’re not fighting
            Do                               Sol
It couldn’t be that we have been this way before
  Lam                             Fa
I know you don’t think that I am trying
  Do                                    Sol
I know you’re wearing thin down to the core


    Fa         Sol
But hold your breath
          Do                                   Lam
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
       Fa
Over again
                       Sol
Don’t make me change my mind

        Do
I won’t live to see another day
  Lam
I swear it’s true
          Fa                              Sol
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
                      Lam Fa Do Sol
You’re impossible to find


Lam                    Fa
 This is not what I intended
          Do                                      Sol
 I always swore to you that I would never fall apart
 Lam                            Fa
 You always thought that I was stronger
            Do
 I may have failed
                                 Sol
 But I have loved you from the start


        Fa         Sol
Oh, but hold your breath
          Do                                   Lam
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
       Fa
Over again
                       Sol
Don’t make me change my mind

        Do
I won’t live to see another day
  Lam
I swear it’s true
          Fa                              Sol
Because a girl like you is impossible to find

It's impossible


   Lam      Fa      Do
So breathe in so deep
  Sol        Lam
Breathe me in
    Fa         Do
I’m yours to keep
    Sol               Lam
And hold onto your words
       Fa         Do
‘Cause talk is cheap
      Sol           Fa
And remember me tonight

When you’re asleep


          Do                                   Lam
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
       Fa
Over again
                       Sol
Don’t make me change my mind
           Do
Or I won’t live to see another day
  Lam
I swear it’s true
          Fa                              Sol
Because a girl like you is impossible to find

  Do                                   Lam
Tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
       Fa
Over again
                       Sol
Don’t make me change my mind
        Do
I won’t live to see another day
  Lam
I swear it’s true
          Fa                              Sol
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
                     (Do)
You’re impossible to find</pre>]
