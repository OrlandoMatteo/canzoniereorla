Re            La          Re
  Oh, it's a mystery to me
          Re          Sol              La
We have a greed with which we have agreed
        Sol                 La                  Sim
And you think you have to want more than you need
  Sol               La                 Sim
Until you have it all, you won't be free


     Sol                  Re
Society, you're a crazy breed
                La              Sim
Hope you're not lonely without me


         Re                  La                   Re
When you want more than you have, you think you need
             Re                   Sol                     La
And when you think more than you want, your thoughts begin to bleed
  Sol               La             Sim
I think I need to find a bigger place
                Sol                  La                    Sim
'Cause when you have more than you think, you need more space

Hope you're not lonely without me
     Sol           Re
Society, crazy indeed
                La              Sim
Hope you're not lonely without me

There's those thinking, more-or-less, less is more
       Re             Sol               La
But if less is more, how you keeping score?
          Sol               La                Sim
Means for every point you make, your level drops
Sol                   La                 Sim
  Kinda like you're starting from the top, you can't do that

Society, have mercy on me

Hope you're not angry if I disagree
