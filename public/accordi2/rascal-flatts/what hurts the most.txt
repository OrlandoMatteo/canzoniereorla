 I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house,
             Re
That don't bother me,
Mim7                Re                          Do
 I can take a few tears now and then and just let em out,
     Re         Doadd9
I'm not       afraid to cry every once in a while,
 Re          Mim7                                 
Even though goin on with you gone, still upsets me,

There are days every now and again, I pretend I'm ok,
              Re
But that's a not what gets me

   What hurts the most,      was being so close,
Sol                          Do Re
 And having so much to say,    and watching you walk away,
Mim                Re   Doadd9
   And never knowin',        what could've been,
Sol                         Re4         Re         
 And not seein that lovin you, is what I was

tryin' to do

   It's hard to deal with the pain of losin you everywhere I go
          Re
But I'm doin' it,
Mim7                          Re                    
   It's hard to force that smile when I see our 
     Doadd9
old friends and I'm alone,
        Re
Still harder,
Doadd9                                  Re 
Gettin up, gettin dressed, livin with this regret,
    Mim7                       Re    Doadd9
But I know if I could do it over,     I would trade, give away
                                                 Re
All the words that I saved in my heart that I left unspoken
