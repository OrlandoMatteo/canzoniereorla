[<pre>Do Sol Lam Fa Sol Do (x2)

Do             Sol     Lam  Fa   Sol      Do
I set out on a narrow way many years ago
Do             Sol       Lam     Fa      Sol     Do
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
    Lam            Sol
But I got lost a time or two
    Fa                   Do
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
Do                Sol    Lam   Fa      Sol         Do
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you


       Fa         Do                 Sol        Do
Every long lost dream lead me to where you are
            Fa        Do                    Fa      Sol
Others who broke my heart they were like northern stars
             Fa      Do             Sol     Lam
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
            Fa        Do
This much I know is true..
     Do              Sol   Lam       Fa       Sol        Do
That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you

  Do                Sol       Lam    Fa      Sol        Do
I think about the years I spent just passing through
     Do                Sol      Lam   Fa          Sol    Do
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
     Lam                  Sol
But you just smile and take my hand
Fa                      Do
You've been there you understand
Do                   Sol        Lam   Fa       Sol     Do
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true


       Fa         Do                 Sol        Do
Every long lost dream lead me to where you are
            Fa        Do                     Fa        Sol
Others who broke my heart they were like northern stars
             Fa      Do             Sol     Lam
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
            Fa        Do
This much I know is true..
      Do                Sol   Lam       Fa        Sol      Do
That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you


Fa Do Sol Do Fa Do Sol Do


                  Fa       Do            Sol      Do
And now I'm just rolling home into my lover's arms
             Fa       Do
This much I know is true..
   Do             Sol    Lam       Fa       Sol        Do  Fa  Sol  Do
That God blessed the broken road that led me straight to you
      Do                            Fa      Sol      Do  Fa  Sol  Do
