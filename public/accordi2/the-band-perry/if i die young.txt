If I die young
           Re
Bury me in satin
        La               Re6/La
Lay me down on a bed of roses
               Sol          Re
Sink me in the river at dawn
        La                        Re6add9/La
Send me away with the words of a love song
Sol       Re      La
  Oh oh, oh oh
  
  
               Sol                             Re
Lord make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
                          La                         Re6add9/La
She'll know I'm safe with You when she stands under my colors
   Sol                                 Re
Oh and life ain't always what you think it ought to be
   La                     Re6add9/La
No, ain't even grey, but she buries her baby


 Sol             Re          La  Re6add9/La
The sharp knife of a short life
     Sol         Re          Re6add9/La
Well, I've had just enough time


         Sol
If I die young

Sink me in the river at dawn
        La                             Re6add9/La
Send me away with the words of a love song


    Sol                Re       La  Re6add9/La
The sharp knife of a short life
     Sol         Re           La 
Well, I've had just enough time


                    Sol                Re          
And I'll be wearing white when I come into Your kingdom
       La                      Re6add9/La
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
    Sol                Re          
I've never known the loving of a man 
       La                         Re6add9/La
but it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
         Sol                            Re          
There's a boy here in town says he'll love me forever
La                        Re6add9/La
Who would have thought forever could be severed by


   Sol             Re          La  Re6add9/La
The sharp knife of a short life
     Sol         Re           La 
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best boys
    Re
And I'll wear my pearls
La
What I never did is done

               Sol                
A penny for my thoughts
        Re          
Oh no, I'll sell them for a dollar
  La                         Re6add9/La
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
     Sol                         Re          
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singing
La                          Re6add9/La
Funny when you're dead how people start listening

Sol            Re
 Oh oh, the ballad of a dove
La        Re6add9/La
  Go in peace and love
 Sol
Gather up your tears
Re
Keep them in your pocket
  La                               Re6add9/La
Save them for a time when you're really gonna need them

          Sol                Re       La    Re6add9/La
Oh oh, the sharp knife of a short life
