Re
He's got a smile that it seems to me
  Doadd9
Reminds me of childhood memories
      Sol                                         Re
Where everything was as fresh as a bright blue sky
Re
Now and then when I see his face
   Doadd9
He takes me away to that special place
    Sol                                                 Re
And if I stared too long I'd probably break down and cry

Re
He's got eyes of the bluest skies
   Doadd9
As if they thought of rain
  Sol                                Re
I hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Re
His hair reminds me of a warm safe place
       Doadd9
Where as a child I'd hide
    Sol
And pray for the thunder and the rain
   Re
To quietly pass me by
