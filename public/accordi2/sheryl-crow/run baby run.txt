        Mi
She was born in November 1963
               Sol#m
The day Aldous Huxley died
        Fa#m7
And her mama believed that every man could be free
       Mi/Sol#  La7
So her mama got high, high, high
Si      Do7
And her daddy marched on Birmingham, singing mighty protest songs
       La7
And he pictured all the places that he knew that she belonged
Sol     Fa7
 But he failed and taught her young
    La#7                           Si7
The only thing she'd need to carry on...
   Si7
He taught her how to

Mi                Do#m7
Run baby run baby run baby run
     Sol#m7   Si
Baby run
Mi                Do#m7
Run baby run baby run baby run
     Sol#m7   Si  La#
Baby run
         La7
Past the arms of the familiar
          Do7
And their talk of better days
       La7
To the comfort of the strangers
         Do7
Slipping out before they say
   Re     Si
So long
              Mi
Baby loves to run

    Mi
She counts out all her money
                                   Sol#m
In the taxi on the way to meet her plane
       Fa#m7
Stares hopeful out the window at the workers fighting
Mi/Sol#     La7
Through the pouring rain
Si        Do7
And she's searching through the stations for an unfamiliar song
        La7
And she thinks about the places where she knows she still belongs
Sol     Fa7
And she smiles the secret smile
            La#7
Because she knows exactly how
         Si7
To carry on

Mi                Do#m7
Run baby run baby run baby run
     Sol#m7   Si
Baby run
Mi                Do#m7
Run baby run baby run baby run
     Sol#m7   Si  La#
Baby run
         La7
Past the arms of the familiar
          Do7
And their talk of better days
       La7
To the comfort of the strangers
         Do7
Slipping out before they say
   Re     Si
So long
              Mi

     Mi   Sol#m   Fa#m7   La7

Si        Do7
And she's searching through the stations for an unfamiliar song
        Lam7
And she pictures all the places where she knows she still belongs
Sol     Fa7
And she smiles the secret smile
            La#7
Because she knows exactly how
         Si7
To carry on

Mi                Do#m7
Run baby run baby run baby run

Baby run
