I've been long, a long way from here
Sol              Lam/Sol
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitos,
     Sol                      Do4  Do
And drank til I was thirsty again
        Sol      Lam/Sol               Sol      Lam/Sol
We went searching through thrift store jungles
        Sol             Lam/Sol
Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo
    Sol                        Do4
And Benny Goodman's corset and pen
      Do               Re
Well, o.k. I made this up
  Do                          Re
I promised you I'd never give up

                Lam9   Do
If it makes you happy
                 Sol   Re
It can't be that bad
                Lam9  Do
If it makes you happy
                          Sol    Lam/Sol
Then why the hell are you so sad

Sol  Lam/Sol

        Sol  Lam/Sol Sol     Lam/Sol
You get down,  real low down
    Sol                 Lam/Sol
You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train
     Sol                     Do4    Do
Well who hasn't been there before?
       Sol  Lam/Sol      Sol       Lam/Sol
I come round, around the hard way
          Sol                       Lam/Sol
Bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread
    Sol                     Do4
And serve you french toast again
      Do               Re
Well, o.k. I still get stoned
    Do                              Re
I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home

                Lam9   Do
If it makes you happy
                 Sol   Re
It can't be that bad
                Lam9  Do
If it makes you happy
                          Sol
Then why the hell are you so sad

If it makes you happy
                 Sol   Re
It can't be that bad
                Lam9  Do
If it makes you happy
                           Mim    Lam
Then why the hell are you so sad

           Sol Lam/Sol         Sol
We've been far,  far away from here
Sol              Lam/Sol
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitos
    Sol               Do4
And everywhere in between
      Do           Re
Well, o.k. we get along
   Do                             Re
So what if right now everything's wrong?

It can't be that bad
