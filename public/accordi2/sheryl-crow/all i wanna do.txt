"Hit it!
                   La#maj7  La7
 This ain't no disco
                               La#maj7  La7
 It ain't no country club either

 This is L.A.!"

"All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die,"
          Do                 Re
 Says the man next to me out of nowhere
Mi
 It's apropos of nothing
                           Do
 He says his name's William but I'm sure,
                       Re
 He's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
Mi
 And he's plain ugly to me
                      Do                        Re
 And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
Mi
 We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
      Do                  Re
 In a bar that faces a giant car wash
Mi
 The good people of the world are washing their cars
                   Do
 On their lunch break, hosing and scrubbing
    Re
 As best they can in skirts in suits"

           "They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
La#maj7  La7
            Back to the phone company, the record store too
La#maj7  La7
           Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, cause"

Mi
 I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
    Do7                                     Re
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
Mi
 He shreds them on the bar then he lights every match
                Do7               Re
In an oversized pack letting each one burn
        Mi
Down to his thick fingers before blowing and cursing them out
Do7                    Re
 And he's watching the bottles of Bud

 As they spin on the floor
     La7
        And a happy couple enters the bar
La#maj7  La7
        Dangerously close to one another
La#maj7  La7
        The bartender looks up from his want ads

La7
 Otherwise the bar is ours
La#maj7 La7
        The day and the night and the car wash, too
La#maj7 La7                                          La#maj7
        The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
La7
  The sun and the moon
