Livin' my life in a slow hell 
  Do
Different girl every night at the hotel 
  Re                         Do      Sol
I aint seen the sun shine in 3 damn days 
  Sol
Been fuelin' up on cocaine and whisky 
  Do
Wish I had a good girl to miss me 
  Re                       Do           Sol
Lord I wonder if I'll ever change my ways 
            Mim

              Sol
Sat down and cried today 
        Re                 Do            Sol

  Sol
I called you lastnight in the hotel 
  Do
Everyone knows but they wont tell 
         Re
But their half hearted smiles tell me 
         Do           Sol
Somethin' just ain't right 
       Sol
I been waitin' on you for a long time 
  Do
Fuelin' up on heartaches and cheap wine 
  Re                       Do      Sol

I wonder where you been

It was the same old same "how have you been"  


 Re                                 Do      Sol
