Do#
What else should I be?

All apologies

What else should I say?

Everyone is gay
Do#7
What else should I write?

I don't have the right

What else should I be?

All apologies

Fa#
In the sun

In the sun I feel as one

In the sun

In the sun
Sol#
Married  ...Buried

Do#
I wish I was like you

Easily amused

Find my nest of salt

Everything is my fault
Do#7
I'll take all the blame

Aqua seafoam shame

Sunburn, freezer burn
Do#                             Fa#
Choking on the ashes of her enemy

In the sun

In the sun I feel as one

In the sun

In the sun
Sol#
Married  Buried  Married   Buried

Do#
All in all is all we are...
