[<pre>Mim  Do  (x4) 
Mim            Do 
Underneath the bridge
Mim                   Do 
The tarp has sprung a leak
         Mim         Do 
And the animals I've trapped
Mim           Do 
All become my pets
        Mim           Do 
And I'm living off of grass
        Mim                Do 
And the drippings from the ceiling
    Mim            Do 
But it's OK to eat fish
            Mim            Do 
'Cause they don't have any feelings
Mim              Do 
Something in the way
Mim    Do 
Mmmm......
Mim              Do 
Something in the way
Mim    Do 
Mmmm......
