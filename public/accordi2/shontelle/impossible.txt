I remember years ago
Sol 
Someone told me I should take
Re
Caution when it comes to love
Do
I did, I did
Mim
And you were strong and I was not
Sol 
My illusion, my mistake
Re
I was careless, I forgot
Do
I did


     Lam7
And now when all is done
                     Sim7
There is nothing to say
                                Do
You have gone and so effortlessly

You have won
                  Re4
You can go ahead tell them


                 Mim
Tell them all I know now
                   Sol
Shout it from the rooftops
                  Re
Write it on the skyline
               Do
All we had is gone now
                 Mim
Tell them I was happy
                Sol
And my heart is broken
                  Re
All my scars are open
                  Do
Tell them what I hoped would be
        Mim          Sol
Impossible, impossible
        Re            Do
Impossible, impossible


Mim
Falling out of love is hard
Sol
Falling for betrayal is worst
Re
Broken trust and broken hearts
Do
I know, I know
Mim
Thinking all you need is there
Sol
Building faith on love is worst
Re
Empty promises will wear
Do
I know (I know)


     Lam7
And know when all is gone
                     Sim7
There is nothing to say
                                Do
And if you're done with embarrassing me
                             Re4
On your own you can go ahead tell them


                 Mim
Tell them all I know now
                   Sol
Shout it from the rooftops

        Mim          Sol
Impossible, impossible
        Re            Do
Impossible, impossible
        Mim          Sol
Impossible, impossible
        Re            Do
Impossible, impossible
        Re            Do
Impossible, impossible
