Rem                 Do                 Sol
  A little late for all the things you didn't say
Rem               Do  Sol
  I'm not sad for you
Rem               Do             Sol
  But I'm sad for all the time I had to waste
Rem                    Do   Sol
  'Cause I learned the truth
Rem                             Do           Sol
  Your heart is in a place I no longer wanna be
Rem                             Do      Sol
  I knew there'd come a day I'd set you free, ´cause
Rem                      Do           Sol
  I'm sick and tired, of always being sick and tired

  Your love isn't fair
    Rem       Lam         Do         Sol
You live in a world where you didn't listen
    Rem        Lam   Do       Sol
And you didn't care... so I'm floating
    Rem         Fa  Sol
I'm floating on aaaair......

Rem          Do        Sol
  No warning of such a sad song
Rem         Do    Sol
  Of broken hearts
Rem            Do              Sol
  My dreams of fairy tales and fantasy, oh
Rem          Do   Sol
  Were torn apart oohhh
Rem                            Do              Sol
  I lost my peace of mind, somewhere along the way
Rem                                 Do      Sol
  I knew there's come a time, you'd hear me say
Rem                      Do           Sol
  I'm sick and tired, of always being sick and tired
