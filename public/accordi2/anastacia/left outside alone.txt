All my life I've been waiting
                  Rem
For you to bring a fairy tale my way
                 La#             Do
Been living in a fantasy without meaning

  Left broken empty in despair

Wanna breath can't find air

  Thought you were sent from up above
                         La#
But you and me never had love
                       La
So much more I have to say
               Rem
Help me find a way
                    La#                      Doadd9
And I wonder if you know, how it really feels
                     Rem
To be left outside alone, when it's cold out here
                       La#                   Doadd9
Well maybe you should know, just how it feels
                     La4                      La
To be left outside alone, to be left outside alone

I´ll tell you...

It's not okay, I don't feel safe,
          Rem
I need to  pray

  Rem
Why do you play me like a game?
                         Solm7
Always someone else to blame

Careless, helpless little man
                         La#
Someday you might understand
                         La
There's not much more to say
                      Rem
But I hope you find a way

                       La#                   Doadd9
Still I wonder if you know, how it really feels
                     Rem
To be left outside alone, when it's cold out here
