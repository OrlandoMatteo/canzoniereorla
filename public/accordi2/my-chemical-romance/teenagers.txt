              Mi
They're gonna clean up your looks

With all the lies in the books
                          Si
To make a citizen out of you
             La
Because they sleep with a gun
            Mi
And keep an eye on you, son
            Si                       Mi
So they can watch all the things you do

Because the drugs never work

They're gonna give you a smirk
                                        Si
'Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
              La
They're gonna rip up your heads,
         Mi
Your aspirations to shreds
        Si                   Mi
Another cog in the murder machine

              Mi
They said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me
                                Si
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
   La                              Mi
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
              Si                       Mi
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me

             Mi
The boys and girls in the clique

The awful names that they stick
                                 Si
You're never gonna fit in much, kid
              La
But if you're troubled and hurt
             Mi
What you got under your shirt
               Si                           Mi
Will make them pay for the things that they did

              Mi
They said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me
                                Si
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
   La                              Mi
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
              Si                       Mi
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
Mi  Fa#m Mi/Sol#
Ohhh yeah!

La   Mi   La   Si

              Mi
They said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me
                                Si
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
   La                              Mi
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
              Si                       Mi
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me

All together now!
Mi
Teenagers scare the living shit out of me
                                Si
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
   La                              Mi
So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
              Si                       Mi
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
