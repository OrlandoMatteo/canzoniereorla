Do                                      
Well when you go
                               Lam
don't ever think i'll make you try to stay
                         Sol                  
and maybe when you get back
                             Do           
I'll be off to find another way
                     Do                      
And after all this time that you still owe
                            Lam             
you're still the good for nothing i don't know
                             Sol                  
so take your gloves and get out, better get out
             Do                                 
while you can      


Fa         Sol                                     
When you go
Sol/Sol#       La5    Sol5       Fa5          
would you even turn to say
Fa/Mi      Fa                        
i don't love you
         Sol

       Do               
yesterday
       
           
             Do                     
sometimes i cry so hard from pleading
                      Lam                  
so sick and tired of all the needless beating
                     Sol                         
but baby when they knock you down and out
                        Do                 
it's where you oughta stay
                    Do               
and after all the blood that you still owe
                  Lam                        
another dollar's just another blow
                      Sol             
so fix your eyes and get up, better get up
           Do                               
while you can
