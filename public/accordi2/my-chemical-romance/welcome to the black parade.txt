When I was a young boy, 
Mim             Re
My father took me into the 
Do      Sol/Si              Lam     Re 
city to see a marching band. 

            Sol             Re/Fa#
He said, "Son when you grow up, 
      Mim          Re             Do  
would you be the saviour of the broken,
Sol/Si      Lam       Re
the beaten and the damned?" 
        Sol         Re/Fa# 
He said "Will you defeat them, 
    Mim            Re          Do            
your demons, and all the non believers, 
Sol/Si         Lam          Re
the plans that they have made?" 
        Sol            Re/Fa#
Because one day I'll leave you, 
   Mim        Re             
A phantom to lead you in the
Do          Sol/Si             Lam      Re
summer, to join the black parade."

[Instrumental 2]
Sol  Re/Fa#  Mim  Re   Do      Re


Sol                   Re/Fa#          
Sometimes I get the feeling she's 
Mim             Do
watching over me. 
       Do          Sol                   Re  
And other times I feel like I should go. 
Sol                        Re/Fa#            
And through it all, the rise and fall, 
      Mim          Do
the bodies in the streets. 
Do                       Sol               Re
And when you're gone we want you all to know.


             Sol
We'll carry on, 
     Re/Fa#   Mim
We'll carry on
       Re          Do           Sol 
And though you're dead and gone believe me 
      Re
Your memory will
      Sol  Re/Fa#
carry on 
            Mim  Re
We'll carry on 
          Do             
And in my heart I can't contain it 
         Re
The anthem won't explain it. 


Sol                Re/Fa#           Mim      Do
A woman sends you reeling from decimated dreams
                 Sol                 Re
Your misery and hate will kill us all. 
Sol                     Re/Fa#
So paint it black and take it back 
Mim                     Do
Lets shout it loud and clear 
Do               Sol
Defiant to the end 
              Re
We hear the call 


             Sol
We'll carry on, 
     Re/Fa#   Mim
We'll carry on
       Re          Do           Sol 
And though you're dead and gone believe me 
      Re
Your memory will
      Sol  Re/Fa#
carry on
            Mim  Re
We'll carry on
                  Do           
And though you're broken and defeated 
       Re              Do
Your weary widow marches 


Si                               Mim
On and on we carry through the fears 

Ooh oh ohhhh 
Si                          Mim
Disappointed faces of your peers 

Ooh oh ohhhh 
Do                         Dom
Take a look at me cause I could not care at all

Sol
Do or die 
Re/Fa#
You'll never make me 
Mim                 Re
Because the world, will never take my heart 
Do           Sol
You can try, you'll never break me 
Do                Re                    Sol
You want it all, you wanna play this part 

Sol                 
I won't explain or
Re/Fa#
Say I'm sorry
Mim             Re 
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scars 
Do             Sol             
Give a cheer, for all the broken 
Do            Re 
Listen here, because it's who we are 

La                Mi/Sol#
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero 
Fa#m              Mi
I'm just a boy, who's meant to sing this song 
Re                La
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero 
Mi    Mi        Mi
I -- don't -- care

We'll carry on 
       Fa#m        Mi
We'll carry on
