       Mim   Do   Lam  Re

    Mim
Its hard to believe that it came to this

You paralysed my body with a poisoned kiss
    Do
For 40 days and nights I was chained to your bed

You thought that was the end of the story
Lam                                      Re
Something inside me called freedom came alive
                    Mim
Living in a world without you

You told me my darling
Do         Fa#m7b5
 Without me you're nothing
Mim                            Do
 You taught me to look in your eyes
          Fa#m7b5
And fed me your sweet lies

Mim
Suddenly someone was there in the window
                                               Sim
Looking outside at the sky that had never been blue
Mim Do Lam Mim Re
    Oh...
Sim       Do    Sim Mim
there's a world without you
Do Lam Mim Re     Sim
I  see the light
Do          Sim      Mim
Living in a world without you
Do Lam Mim Re
Oh...
Sim      Do   Sim Mim
there is hope to guide me
Do Lam  Mim Re   Sim
I  will survive
Do          Sim      Mim
Living in a world without you

                     Mim
Living in a world without you

You put me together
Do              Fa#m7b5       Mim
 Then trashed me for pleasure
                       Do
You used me again and again
         Fa#m7b5
Abused me, confused me

Mim
Suddenly naked I run through your garden
                                                    Sim
Right through the gates of the past and I'm finally free
Mim Do Lam Mim Re
    Oh...
Sim       Do    Sim Mim
there's a world without you
Do Lam Mim Re     Sim
I  see the light
Do          Sim      Mim
Living in a world without you
Do Lam Mim Re
Oh...
Sim      Do   Sim Mim
there is hope to guide me
Do Lam  Mim Re   Sim
I  will survive
