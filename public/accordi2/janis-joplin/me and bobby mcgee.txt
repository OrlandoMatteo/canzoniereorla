Sol               Sol          Sol                Sol
Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waitin' for a train
         Sol                Sol        Re7      Re7
When I's feelin' near as faded as my jeans
Re7               Re7        Re7               Re7
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
     Re7              Re7            Sol - Do/Sol    Sol
And rode us all the way into New Orleans

  Sol             Sol             Sol             Sol
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
    Sol                   Sol7              Do    Do
I's playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues
Do                   Do                 Sol                Sol
Windshield wipers slappin' time, I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
Re7             Re7               Re7   Re7
We sang every song that driver knew


Do                Do             Sol                 Sol
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Re7                 Re7                          Sol    Sol
Nothin', it ain't nothin' honey, if it ain't free
    Do                Do              Sol                 Sol
And feelin' good was easy, lord, oh, when he sang the blues
         Re7               Re7               Re7  Re7
You know feelin' good was good enough for me
Re7               Re7               Sol    Sol    La    La
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee


         La         La                La          La
From the Kentucky coal mines to the California sun
     La                 La          Mi7      Mi7
Yeah Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
        Mi7            Mi7              Mi7             Mi7
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
     Mi7         Mi7               La     La
Yeah Bobby baby kept me from the cold

    La              La            La                 La
One day up near Salinas, lo-ord, I let him slip away
     La                 La7                 Re        Re
He's lookin' for that home and I hope he finds it
         Re               Re              La            La
Well I'd trade all my tomorrows for one single yesterday
      Mi7               Mi7           Mi7   Mi7
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine


Re                Re             La                 La
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Mi7                   Mi7             La       La
Nothin', and that's all that Bobby left me
      Re                Re          La                     La

And feelin' good was good enough for me
