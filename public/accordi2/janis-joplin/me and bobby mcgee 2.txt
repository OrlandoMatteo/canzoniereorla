     Sol   Do/Sol   Sol   Do/Sol

Sol
Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waitin' for a train
                                     Re7
When I's feelin' near as faded as my jeans

Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
                                   Sol   Do/Sol
And rode us all the way into New Orleans

  Sol
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
                       Sol7           Do
I's playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues
                                       Sol
Windshield wipers slappin' time, I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
Re7
We sang every song that driver knew

Do                              Sol
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Re7                                          Sol
Nothin', it ain't nothin' honey, if it ain't free
    Do                              Sol
And feelin' good was easy, lord, oh, when he sang the blues
         Re7
You know feelin' good was good enough for me
                                  Sol
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee


     La

         La
From the Kentucky coal mines to the California sun
                                    Mi7
Yeah Bobby shared the secrets of my soul

Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
                                 La
Yeah Bobby baby kept me from the cold

    La
One day up near Salinas, lo-ord, I let him slip away
                      La7                Re
He's lookin' for that home and I hope he finds it
                                        La
Well I'd trade all my tomorrows for one single yesterday
      Mi7
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Re                              La
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Mi7                                     La
Nothin', and that's all that Bobby left me
      Re                            La
Well, feelin' good was easy, lo-o-ord, when he sang the blues
    Mi7
And feelin' good was good enough for me
