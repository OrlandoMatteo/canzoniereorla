            Sol#add9         La#
Though I've tried before to tell her
        Dom7           La#/Re      Sol#add9  La#  Dom7  La#7/Re
Of the feelings I have for her in my  heart
      Sol#add9          La#
Every time that I come near her
       Dom7                  La#7/Re       Re#
I just lose my nerve as I've done from the start

             La#               Re#
Every little thing she does is magic
               La#               Re#
Everything she do just turns me on
               La#             Re#
Even though my life before was tragic
              La#               Si  Fa#maj7  Sol#add9  La#7sus4
Now I know my love for her goes on

     Sol#add9          La#
Do I have to tell the story
     Dom7           La#7/Re          Sol#add9 La#  Dom7  La#7/Re
Of a thousand rainy days since we first   met
       Sol#add9      La#
It's a big enough umbrella
         Dom7           La#/Re          Re#
But it's always me that ends up getting wet

Now I know my love for her goes on

Si             La#m7
 I resolved to call her up
Sol#m7               La#m7
 A thousand times a day
Sol#m7                  La#m7
 And ask her if she'll marry me
Si                      La#m7
 In some old fashioned way
       Si                Do#add9
But my silent fears have gripped me
       Si                Do#add9
Long before I reach the phone
        Si                 Do#add9
Long before my tongue has tripped me
       Si     Do#add9  Re#
Must I always be      alone?
