Sol                
Every breath you take
               Mim
Every move you make
               Do
Every bond you break
               Re
Every step you take
                 Sol 
I'll be watching you
                        
             Sol
Every single day
                   Mim
And every word you say
               Do
Every game you play
                Re
Every night you stay
                 Sol
I'll be watching you


             Do                  Sol 
Oh can't you see, you belong to me
                  La7                         Re
How my poor heart aches, with every step you take

                   Sol
And every move you make
                  Mim
And every vow you break
                Do
Every smile you fake
                Re
Every claim you stake
                 Sol
I'll be watching you

Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace
                                      Re#
I dream at night, I can only see your face
                                     Fa
I look around but it's you I can't replace
                                     Re#
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
                          Sol
I keep crying baby, baby, please
