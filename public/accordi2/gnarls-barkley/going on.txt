Fam                       Dom
 I’ve seen it with my own eyes
                       Re#
How we’re gettin’ otherwise
                      La#
Without the luxury of leavin’
Fam                       Dom
 The touch and feeling of free is
                Re#
Untangible technically
                          La#
Something you’ve got to believe in
Fam                     Dom
Connect the cause and effect
                         Re#
One foot in front of the next
                        La#
This is the start of a journey
Fam                    Dom
And my mind is already gone
                              Re#
And though there are other unknowns
                        La#
Somehow this doesn’t concern me
            Sol#
And you can stand right there if you want

              Re#m  La#m
But I’m going on
           Do#             Sol#
And I’m prepared to go it alone
          Re#m  La#m
I’m going on
                  Do#                 Sol#
To a place in the sun that’s nice and warm

           Fam
I’m going on
        Dom                 Re#            La#       Fam
And I’m sure they’ll have a place for you too oohoohoo

                            Dom
Anyone that needs what they want,
                           Re#
and doesn’t want what they need
                  La#
I want nothing to do with
Fam               Dom
 And to do what I want
                 Re#
And to do what I please
                   La#
Is first of my to-do list
Fam                  Dom                      Re#
 But every once in a while I think about her smile
                        La#
One of the few things I do miss
Fam                Dom
 But baby I‘ve to go
                 Re#
Baby I’ve got to know
                  La#
Baby I’ve got to prove it
         Sol#
And I’ll see you when you get there

              Re#m  La#m
But I’m going on
           Do#             Sol#
And I’m prepared to go it alone
          Re#m  La#m
I’m going on
                  Do#                 Sol#
To a place in the sun that’s nice and warm

           Fam
I’m going on
         Dom          Re#          La#
And I promise I’ll be waiting for you oohoohoo
