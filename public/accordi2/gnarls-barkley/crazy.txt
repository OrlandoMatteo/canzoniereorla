I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
                                             Fa
There was something so pleasant about that place.

Even your emotions had an echo
               Mi4   Mi
In so much space
Lam
And when you're out there, without care,
                     Domaj7
Yeah, I was out of touch
                                       Fa
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
                       Mi4  Mi
I just knew too much


                  Lam
Does that make me crazy?
                  Do
Does that make me crazy??
                  Fa
Does that make me crazy???
                  Mi4     Mi
Possibly.


La                                                Fa
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
            Domaj7                    Mi4   Mi
But think twice, that's my only advice
Lam                                                                     Do
Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are,
                      Fa
Ha ha ha bless your soul
                             Mi4       Mi
You really think you're in control


                  Lam
Well, I think you're crazy!
                  Domaj7
I think you're crazy!
                  Fa
I think you're crazy,
                  Mi4     Mi
Just like me.


La                                                Fa
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
            Domaj7                    Mi4   Mi
And all I remember is thinking, I want to be like them
Lam                                                                     Do
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun
                      Fa
And it's no coincidence I've come
                             Mi4       Mi
And I can die when I'm done


          Lam
Maybe I'm crazy
             Domaj7
Maybe you're crazy
            Fa
Maybe we're crazy
            Mi4     Mi
Probably
