Have you seen the old man in the closed-down market
Fa              Do/Sol            Rem/Fa     Sol
Kicking up the paper with his worn-out shoes?
Do               Sol             Lam               Mim
In his eyes you see no pride, and held loosely at his side
Fa             Do/Sol           Sol7          Do       Do
  Yesterday's paper telling yesterday's news


   Fa           Mim             Do    Sol/Si  Lam   Lam/Sol
So how can you tell me you're lo - ne - ly
Re7/Fa#                                Sol    Sol7
  and say for you that the sun don't shine?
Do               Sol               Lam                   Mim
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London,
Fa               Do/Sol          Sol7                   Do
  I'll show you something to make you change your mind

Do                 Sol            Lam                   Mim
Have you seen the old girl who walks the streets of London
Fa           Do/Sol          Rem/Fa       Sol
Dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags?
Do                 Sol            Lam                  Mim
She's no time for talking, she just keeps right on walking
Fa            Do/Sol     Sol7          Do       Do
Carrying her home in two carrier bags


   Fa           Mim             Do    Sol/Si  Lam   Lam/Sol
So how can you tell me you're lo - ne - ly

In the all-night cafe at a quarter past eleven
Fa        Do/Sol         Rem/Fa         Sol
Same old man sitting there on his own
Do              Sol              Lam         Mim
Looking at the world over the rim of his tea-cup
Fa                 Do/Sol          Sol7            Do       Do
Each tea lasts an hour, and he wanders home alone


   Fa           Mim             Do    Sol/Si  Lam   Lam/Sol
So how can you tell me you're lo - ne - ly
Re7/Fa#                                  Sol       Sol7
  Don't say for you that the sun don't shine
Do/Sol             Sol               Lam                   Mim

Do/Sol               Sol          Lam                Mim
Have you seen the old man outside the seaman's mission?
Fa             Do/Sol            Rem/Fa            Sol
Memory fading with the medal ribbons that he wears
Do             Sol             Lam             Mim
In our winter city the rain cries a little pity
    Fa                  Do/Sol        Sol7                 Do    Do
For one more forgotten hero and a world that doesn't care


   Fa           Mim             Do    Sol/Si  Lam   Lam/Sol
So how can you tell me you're lo - ne - ly

Fa               Do/Sol          Sol7                   Do      Fa/Do     Do
  I'll show you something to make you change your mind</pre>]
