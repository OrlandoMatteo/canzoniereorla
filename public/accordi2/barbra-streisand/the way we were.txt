La        Re/La
 Mem'ries,
             Fa#m     Fa#m/Mi  Remaj7
Light the corners of my mind
Do#7        Fa#m         Mi  Re
Misty water-colored memories
Re/Mi      La       Re/La  Re/Mi
Of the way we were
La                 Re/La
 Scattered pictures,
               Fa#m      Fa#m/Mi  Remaj7
Of the smiles we left behind
Do#7                Fa#m      Mi Re Re/Mi
Smiles we gave to one another
            La       Sol6/La
For the way we were

Remaj7                   Do#m   Sim7
 Can it be that it was all so simple then?
Do#m7                       Fa#7sus4   Fa#7
 Or has time re-written every line?
Sim    Sim7             Re/Mi
 If we had the chance to do it all again
Lamaj7               Re6/Mi
Tell me, would we?    Could we?

La       Re/La              Fa#m    Fa#m/Mi  Remaj7
 Mem'ries, may be beautiful and yet
       Do#7       Fa#m      Mi Remaj7
What's too painful to remember
        Do#7      Fa#m     Fa#m/Mi  Re
We simply choose to forget
            Do#m7  Re
So it's the laughter
        Do#m7   Remaj7
We will remember
            Do#m7   Sim11
Whenever we remember...
Re/Mi   La      Lamaj7  Re6/La
The way we were...
            La
The way we were...
