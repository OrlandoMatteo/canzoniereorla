Re#m      Sol#m     Re#m
Life is a moment in space
         Sol#m    Si
When the dream is gone
       Do#      Fa#
It's a lonelier place
Do#m           Do#m/Sol#   Si
  I kissed the morning goodbye
    Si/La#  Simaj7
But down  inside
            Sol#m      La#
You know we never know why

Re#m          Sol#m      Re#m
  The road is narrow and lone
     Sol#m     Si
When eyes meet eyes
        Do#        Fa#
And the feeling is strong
Do#m                   Fa#
  I turn away from the wall
  Si          Fa#
I stumble and fall
      Si          La#7
But I give you it all

Re#m     La#7     Re#m
  I am a woman in love
        La#7  Re#m
And I'd do anything
           La#7    Re#m
To get you into my world
    La#7         Re#m
And hold you within
       Do#       Sol#m
It's a right I defend
               Fa#
Over and over again
Re#m          Re#m   Simaj7
What do I do.....

Re#m        Sol#m    Re#m
  With you eternally mine
   Sol#m      Si
In love there is
   Do#        Fa#
No measure of time
Do#m            Do#m/Sol#  Si
  We planned it all at the start
     Si/La#  Simaj7
That you and I
     Sol#m           La#
Live in each other's heart

Re#m        Sol#m   Re#m
  We may be oceans away
    Sol#m   Si
You feel my love
  Do#           Fa#
I hear what you say
Do#m               Fa#
No truth is ever a lie
  Si          Fa#
I stumble and fall
      Si          La#7
But I give you it all

Re#m     La#7     Re#m
  I am a woman in love
        La#7  Re#m
And I'd do anything
           La#7    Re#m
To get you into my world
    La#7         Re#m
And hold you within
       Do#       Sol#m
It's a right I defend
               Fa#
Over and over again
Re#m         Re#m   Si7
What do I do........  Oh, oh, oh, oh ...

Mim      Si7      Mim
  I am a woman in love
        Si7        Mim
And I'm talking to you
           Si7          Mim
You know I know how you feel
       Si7       Mim
What a woman can do
       Re        Lam
It's a right I defend
               Si7
Over and over again

Mim      Si7      Mim

And I'm talking to you
