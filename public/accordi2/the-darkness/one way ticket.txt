         Si5                                    Do#5  Mi5 Si5 La5
It was a dusty old night and I'm the first to admit it
    Si5                                    Do#5  Mi5 Si5 La5
I'm sure I upset someone but my memory has chosen to omit it
  Si5                                    Do#5  Mi5 Si5 La5
A tiny voice telling me I really should cool it
Si5                               Do#5  Mi5 Si5 La5
Chewing my face off talking absolute rubbish
    Si5                                  La
The first line hit me like a kick in the face
  Si5                                          La
I thought "I'd better have another one just in case"
Si5
Next thing i knew, my heart was under attack
  Laadd9        Sol#m7    Fa#m7
I bought a one way ticket to hell...and back

Mi      Laadd9    Si
One way ticket to hell and back
         Mi/Sol# Laadd9    Si
Bought a one way ticket to hell and back
Mi      Laadd9    Si
One way ticket to hell and back
         Mi/Sol# Laadd9    Si
Bought a one way ticket to hell...

     Si                                     Do#m  Mi5 Si5 La5
I've always tried to keep my vices under wraps
      Si                                         Do#m  Mi5 Si5 La5
But a coach-load of mutes would appear talkative chaps
            Si                                 Do#m  Mi5 Si5 La5
If they had seen fit to join me for a couple of hits
       Si                                          Do#m  Mi5 Si5 La5
Now my septum is in tatters and I've still got the runs
Si5                                        La
Burned for a moment, then it kicked like a mule
    Si5                                         La
The strangers I recruited thought it was rocket fuel
Si5
Several massive choking lines of glorius gack
           Laadd9  Sol#m7    Fa#m7
I bought a one way ticket to hell...and back

Mi  Laadd9        Si
One way ticket to hell and back
         Mi/Sol# Laadd9    Si
Bought a one way ticket to hell and back
Mi  Laadd9        Si
One way ticket to hell and back
         Mi/Sol# Laadd9    Si       Do#m
Bought a one way ticket to hell...

                         Do#5    Fa#5 Mi5 Si5 Do5
Stick it up your f***ing nose!

Do#5 Sol#5 Fa#5 Mi5 Si5 Do5

Do#5   Fa#5 Mi5 Si5 Do5

Do#5 Sol#5 Fa#5 Mi5 Si5 La5

Si5                                                       La
Holding court, repeating myself, each repetition slightly louder
Si5                                         La
Pausing just long enough to snort the white powder
Si5
The wheels came off but I'm still on track
           Laadd9  Sol#m7    Fa#m7
I bought a one way ticket to hell...and back

Mi  Laadd9        Si
One way ticket to hell and back

Bought a one way ticket to hell and back
Mi  Laadd9        Si
One way ticket to hell and back
         Mi/Sol# Laadd9    Si
Bought a one way ticket to hell...
Mi  Laadd9        Si
One way ticket to hell and back
         Mi/Sol# Laadd9    Si
Bought a one way ticket to hell and back
Mi  Laadd9        Si
One way ticket to hell and back
         Mi/Sol# Laadd9    Si
Bought a one way ticket to hell...
