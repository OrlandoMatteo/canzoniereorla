The first flush of youth was upon you when our eyes first met
                             Re                    La
And I knew that to you and into your life I had to get
  Sol                      Re                       La    Sol
I felt light-headed at the touch of this stranger's hand
                            Re                    La
An assault my defenses systematically fail to withstand
                     Mim
'Cause you came at a time
                             La
When the pursuit of one true love in which to fall
Mim      Re             Sim
 Was the be-all and end-all

Love is only a feeling

Drifting away

When I'm in your arms I start believing
La        Mi  Sim
It's here to stay
            Sol     Re      La
But love is only a feeling

Oh, the state of elation that this unison of hearts achieved
                                 Re                   La
I had seen, I had touched, I had tasted and I truly believed
                     Mim
That the light of my life
                                     La
Would tear a hole right through each cloud that scudded by
Mim      Re              Sim
 Just to beam on you and I
