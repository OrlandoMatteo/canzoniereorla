Do#
 Sail on, down the line
    Re#m
About half a mile or so
                                Do#
And I don't really wanna know ah

Where you're going
                           Re#m
Maybe once or twice you see

Time after time I tried

Hold on to what we got
   Do#
But  now you're going

Fa#maj7       Sol#
 And I don't mind
          Do#           Sol#   La#m  Si/Do#
About the things you're gonna say
    Fa#maj7          Sol#          Do# Sol# La#m  Si/Do#
Lord, I gave all my money and my time
Fa#maj7         Sol#
 I know it's a shame
        Do#        Sol#       La#m   Sol# Fa#
But I'm giving you back your name
              Do#/Fa Re#m  Fa#/La
Guess I'll be on my  way
  Fa#     Do#/Fa  Re#m  Fa#/Sol#
I won't be back to stay
  Fa#       Do#/Fa Re#m
I guess I'll move  along
    Fa#/Sol#      Do#  Sol#    Do#   Re#m   Do#
I'm looking for a good time

Do#
 Sail on down the line
        Re#m
Ain't it funny how the time can go

All my friends say they told me so
      Do#
But it doesn't matter

It was plain to see
      Re#m
That a small town boy like me

Just I wasn't your cup of tea
     Do#
I was  wishful thinking

Fa#maj7         Sol#
 I gave you my heart
      Do#      Sol#      La#m   Si/Do# Fa#maj7
And I tried to make you happy
                Sol#          Do# Sol# La#m
And you gave me nothing in return
Si/Do#      Fa#maj7           Sol#
You know it ain't so hard to say
          Do#         Sol# La#m   Sol# Fa#
Would you please just go away
             Do#/Fa  Re#m   Fa#/Sol#
I've thrown away the blues
    Fa#     Do#/Fa Re#m  Fa#/Sol#
I'm tired of being used
       Fa# Do#/Fa Re#m
I want everyone to know
    Fa#/Sol#      Do#  Sol#
I'm looking for a good time
Si   Fa#  Sol#
Good time
