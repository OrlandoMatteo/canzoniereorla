Simaj7             La#m7          Simaj7
 I may be just a foolish dreamer
       La#m7     La#7  Simaj7
But I don't care
                La#m7
Cause I know my happiness
          Sol#m7      Si/Do#    La#m7 Simaj7
Is waiting out there, somewhere
                       La#m7         Simaj7
I'm searching for that silver lining
                   La#m7       La#7 Simaj7
Horizons that I've never seen
                  La#m7
Whoa, I'd like to take just this moment
Sol#m7            Si/Do#           Re#maj9   Re#m11
And dream my dream,  whoa dream my dream

      Sol#m9  Do#         La#m7         Sol#m9
Whoa, zoom, I'd like to fly far away from here
         Do#   La#m7       Sol#m9
Where my mind, oh Lord, is fresh and clear
    Do#           La#m7       Sol#m9
And I'll find the love that I long to see
Do#              La#m7           Sol#m9    La#m7 Simaj7
Where everybody can be what they wanna be

                         La#m7               Simaj7
Whoa, I'd like to greet the sun each morning
               La#m7           La#7  Simaj7
And walk amongst the stars at night
                   La#m7
I'd like to know the taste of honey
   Sol#m7      Si/Do#   La#m7 Simaj7
In my life, in my life
                     La#m7      Simaj7
Well, I've shared so many pains
                 La#m7         Simaj7
And I've played so many games
                           La#m7
Ah, but everyone finds the right way
    Sol#m7  Si/Do#      Re#maj9    Re#m11
Somehow, somewhere, someday

      Sol#m9  Do#         La#m7         Sol#m9
Whoa, zoom, I'd like to fly far away from here
         Do#   La#m7       Sol#m9
Where my mind, oh Lord, is fresh and clear
    Do#           La#m7       Sol#m9
And I'll find the love that I long to see
Do#              La#m7           Sol#m9    Re#maj9  Re#m11
Where everybody can be what they wanna be

        Simaj7   La#m7   Sol#m7   Si/Do#

       La#m7 Simaj7
Ooh, ooh...
                            La#m7        Simaj7
Whoa, I wish the world were truly happy
          La#m7  La#7 Simaj7
Living as one
                La#m7               Sol#m7
I wish the world they call freedom
                   Si/Do#          Re#maj9    Re#m11
Someday would come, some day would come, baby

      Sol#m9  Do#         La#m7         Sol#m9
Whoa, zoom, I'd like to fly far away from here
         Do#   La#m7       Sol#m9
Where my mind, oh Lord, is fresh and clear
    Do#           La#m7       Sol#m9
And I'll find the love that I long to see
Do#              La#m7           Sol#m9
Where everybody can be what they wanna be

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, baby

Do#  La#m7  Sol#m9    Do#  La#m7  Sol#m9

Do#  La#m7  Sol#m9    Do#  La#m7  Sol#m9
