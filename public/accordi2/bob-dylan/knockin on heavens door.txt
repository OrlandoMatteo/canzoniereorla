Mama take this badge off of me
Sol       Re         Do
I can't use it anymore
Sol            Re                        Lam
It's getting dark, too dark to see
Sol          Re                   Do
I feel I'm knockin on heaven's door


Sol             Re                    Lam
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Sol             Re                    Do
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Sol             Re                    Lam
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Sol             Re                    Do
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door


Sol           Re           Lam
Mama put my guns in the ground
Sol       Re             Do
I can't shoot them anymore
Sol               Re               Lam
That long black cloud is comin' down
Sol          Re                    Do
I feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door


Sol             Re                    Lam
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Sol             Re                    Do
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Sol             Re                    Lam
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Sol             Re                    Do
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door


Sol    Re    Lam
 Oo - oo - oo - oo
