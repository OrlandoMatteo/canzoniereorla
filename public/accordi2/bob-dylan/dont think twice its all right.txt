[<pre>   Do               Sol              Lam
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
Fa                       Do   Sol
 If'n you don't know by now
       Do               Sol              Lam
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
Re7                   Sol    Sol7
  It'll never do somehow
          Do                    Do7
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Fa                         Re7
 Look out your window and I'll be gone
Do          Sol          Lam        Fa
You're the reason I'm trav'lin' on
Do           Sol               Do
Don't think twice, it's all right


       Do               Sol               Lam
And it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
     Fa             Do      Sol
That light I never knowed
       Do               Sol               Lam
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
Re7                           Sol      Sol7
 I'm on the dark side of the road
        Do                                  Do7
But I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
   Fa                         Re7
To try and make me change my mind and stay
Do        Sol            Lam             Fa
We never did too much talkin' anyway
Do            Sol              Do
Don't think twice, it's all right


       Do               Sol              Lam
No, it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
Fa                     Do    Sol
 Like you never did before
       Do               Sol              Lam
And it ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal
Re7                   Sol     Sol7
 I can't hear you anymore
      Do                        Do7
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' walkin'
all the way down the road
  Fa                     Re7
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
  Do           Sol             Lam           Fa
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
Do           Sol               Do
Don't think twice, it's all right


   Do   Sol            Lam
So loooooong, honey babe
          Fa              Do    Sol 
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
    Do         Sol          Lam
But goodbye's too good a word, babe
Re7                          Sol      Sol7
 So I'll just say fare thee well
Do                          Do7
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
    Fa                          Re7
You could have done better but I don't mind
Do              Sol        Lam        Fa
You just kinda wasted my precious time
    Do           Sol               Do
But don't think twice, it's all right</pre>]
