Do                   Rem7
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
    Mim                   Fa            Sol
You threw the bums a dime in your prime,  didn't you?
Do                     Rem7
  People'd call, say, "Beware doll,
       Mim                        Fa            Sol
you're bound to fall" You thought they were all   kiddin' you

Fa            Sol
  You used to   laugh about
Fa                   Sol
  Everybody that was   hangin' out

Fa   Mim       Rem7    Do
 Now you don't talk so loud
Fa        Mim  Rem7    Do
 Now you don't seem so proud

 Rem7                         Fa            Sol
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.

                Do  Fa  Sol
How does it feel
                Do  Fa  Sol
How does it feel
                    Do  Fa  Sol
To be without a home
                       Do  Fa  Sol
Like a complete unknown
                     Do  Fa  Sol
Like a rolling stone


     Do  Fa  Sol

    Do                         Rem7                   Mim
Aww, You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
                      Fa          Sol
But you know you only used to get   juiced in it
Do                 Rem7                        Mim
 Nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
               Fa                     Sol
And now you're just gonna have to get   used to it

Fa                    Sol
  You said you'd never  compromise
Fa                                   Sol
  With the mystery tramp, but now you  realize

Fa        Mim        Rem7  Do
 He's not selling any  alibis
        Fa             Mim     Rem7   Do
 As you stare into the vacuum  of his eyes

    Rem7               Fa     Sol
And say do you want to make a deal?

                Do  Fa  Sol
How does it feel
                Do  Fa  Sol
How does it feel
                    Do  Fa  Sol
To be without a home
                       Do  Fa  Sol
Like a complete unknown
                     Do  Fa  Sol
Like a rolling stone


     Do  Fa  Sol

         Do                     Rem7
Aww, You never turned around to see the frowns
       Mim                    Fa                  Sol
On the jugglers and the clowns  when they all did tricks for you
    Do                       Rem7
You never understood that it ain't no good
Mim             Fa                        Sol
  You shouldn't let other people get your   kicks for you

Fa                                               Sol
  You used to ride on the chrome horse with your   diplomat
Fa                              Sol
  Who carried on his shoulder a   Siamese cat

Fa             Mim         Rem7    Do
 Ain't it hard  when you discover that
Fa         Mim     Rem7       Do
 He really wasn't  where it's at
Rem7                              Fa       Sol
After he took from you everything he could steal.

                Do  Fa  Sol
How does it feel
                Do  Fa  Sol
How does it feel
                    Do  Fa  Sol
To be without a home
                       Do  Fa  Sol
Like a complete unknown
                     Do  Fa  Sol
Like a rolling stone


     Do  Fa  Sol

     Do              Rem7                Mim
Aww, Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
Fa                                        Sol
 They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they   got it made
Do              Rem7          Mim
 Exchanging all precious gifts
Fa                                 Sol
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe

Fa               Sol
  You used to be  so amused
Fa                            Sol
  At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used

Fa                 Mim            Rem7    Do
 Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
Fa            Mim              Rem7       Do
 When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose
       Rem7                               Fa    Sol
 You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.

                Do  Fa  Sol
How does it feel
                Do  Fa  Sol
How does it feel
                    Do  Fa  Sol
To be without a home
                       Do  Fa  Sol
Like a complete unknown
                     Do  Fa  Sol
Like a rolling stone
