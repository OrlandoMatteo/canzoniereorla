   And another man named Bello, movin’ around mysteriously

  The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance

  The judge made Rubin’s witnesses drunkards from the slums
Lam                                           Fa
  To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum

  And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger

  Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
Lam                                 Fa
  While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
Lam                    Fa
  An innocent man in a living hell

      But it won’t be over till they clear his name
Rem                               Do
  And give him back the time he’s done

  Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
