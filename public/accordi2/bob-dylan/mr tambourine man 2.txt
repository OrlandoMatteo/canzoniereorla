Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
        Re               Sol/Re          La       La4  La
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.

In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you.

         Sol/Re             La           Re          Sol/Re
Though I know that evenings empire has returned into sand,
Re               Sol/Re
Vanished from my hand,
        Re              Sol/Re              La
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping.
   Sol/Re     La            Re            Sol/Re
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
  Re             Sol/Re
I have no one to meet
        Re            Sol/Re                La
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.

Sol/Re       La             Re             Sol/Re
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship,
   Re               Sol/Re       Re                  Sol/Re
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip,
   Re               Sol/Re     Re          Sol/Re
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
      La
To be wandering.
    Sol/Re      La            Re           Sol/Re
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Re          Sol/Re            Re               Sol/Re
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way,
                La
I promise to go under it.

           Sol/Re               La                 Re               Sol/Re
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
         Re          Sol/Re           Re            Sol/Re
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escaping on the run
        Re                Sol/Re        La
And but for the sky there are no fences facing.
    Sol/Re            La        Re                Sol/Re
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
        Re            Sol/Re            Re             Sol/Re
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind,
           Re         Sol/Re            Re
I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're
Sol/Re           La
Seeing that he's chasing.

Sol/Re   La              Re              Sol/Re  Sol6  Sol/Re

     Sol/Re       La                  Re                Sol/Re
Then take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind,
         Re             Sol/Re    Re              Sol/Re
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,
    Re                  Sol/Re     Re           Sol/Re
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,
    Re               Sol/Re         La
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
        Sol/Re            La               Re              Sol/Re
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
    Re             Sol/Re       Re            Sol/Re
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,
         Re         Sol/Re      Re               Sol/Re
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,
          Re          Sol/Re      La
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.

Sol/Re   La              Re              Sol/Re  Sol6  Sol/Re
