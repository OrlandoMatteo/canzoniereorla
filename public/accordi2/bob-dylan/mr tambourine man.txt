Sol        La               Re               Sol
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
        Re                Sol               La
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Sol        La               Re               Sol
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
       Re             Sol                 La         Re
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you.  


Sol                           La          Re             Sol
Though I know that evenings empire has returned into sand,
Re                Sol
Vanished from my hand,
        Re               Sol                   La
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping.
   Sol          La             Re             Sol
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
  Re              Sol
I have no one to meet
        Re             Sol                     La
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.


Sol        La               Re               Sol
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
        Re                Sol               La
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Sol        La               Re               Sol
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
       Re             Sol                 La         Re
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you.


Sol            La              Re              Sol
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship,
   Re                Sol            Re                   Sol
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip,
   Re                Sol          Re           Sol
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
      La
To be wandering.
    Sol           La             Re            Sol
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
  Re           Sol               Re                Sol
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way,
                La
I promise to go under it.


Sol        La               Re               Sol
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
        Re                Sol               La
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Sol        La               Re               Sol
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
       Re             Sol                 La         Re
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you.



Sol                               La                  Re                Sol
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
         Re           Sol                Re             Sol
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escaping on the run
        Re                 Sol             La
And but for the sky there are no fences facing.
    Sol                 La         Re                 Sol
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
        Re             Sol                 Re              Sol
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind,
           Re          Sol                 Re
I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're
Sol                La
Seeing that he's chasing.


Sol        La               Re               Sol
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
        Re                Sol               La
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Sol        La               Re               Sol
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
       Re             Sol                 La         Re
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you.


     Sol            La                   Re                 Sol
Then take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind,
         Re              Sol         Re               Sol
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,
    Re                   Sol          Re            Sol
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,
    Re                Sol              La
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
        Sol                 La                Re               Sol
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
    Re              Sol            Re             Sol
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,
         Re          Sol           Re                Sol
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,
          Re         Sol             La
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.


Sol        La               Re               Sol
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
        Re                Sol               La
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Sol        La               Re               Sol
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
       Re             Sol                 La         Re
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you.</pre>]
