La                    Sol/La
Early one morning the sun was shining
La              Sol/La
I was laying in bed
La                 Sol/La
Wondering if she'd changed at all
       Re
If her hair was still red
La                      Sol/La
Her folks they said our lives together
La                 Sol/La
Sure was gonna be rough
     La                    Sol/La
They never did like mama's homemade dress
       Re
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
    Mi                    Fa#m
And I was standing on the side of the road
La                  Re
Rain falling on my shoes
Mi                   Fa#m
 Heading out for the East Coast
     La                   Re
Lord knows I've paid some dues
        Mi
Getting through
Sol     Re    La   La4  La  La4  La  La4  La  La4
Tangled up in blue

La                   Sol/La
She was married when we first met
La             Sol/La
 Soon to be divorced
La                     Sol/La
 I helped her out of a jam I guess
      Re
But I used a little too much force
   La                Sol/La
We drove that car as far as we could
La               Sol/La
Abandoned it out West
La             Sol/La
 Split up on a dark sad night
     Re
Both agreeing it was best
Mi                   Fa#m
She turned around to look at me
   La             Re
As I was walking away
Mi                    Fa#m
 I heard her say over my shoulder
       La             Re
"We'll meet again someday
          Mi
on the avenue"
Sol     Re    La   La4  La  La4  La  La4  La  La4
Tangled up in blue

La                 Sol/La
I had a job in the great north woods
La                      Sol/La
Working as a cook for a spell
      La                 Sol/La
But I never did like it all that much
        Re
And one day the ax just fell
     La              Sol/La
So I drifted down to New Orleans
     La                 Sol/La
so I lucky was to be employed
La                        Sol/La
Working for a while on a fishing boat
          Re
Right outside of Delacroix
Mi                  Fa#m
But all the while I was alone
    La               Re
The past was close behind
Mi               Fa#m
I seen a lot of women
        La               Re
But she never escaped my mind
           Mi
And I just grew
Sol     Re    La  La4  La  La4  La  La4  La  La4
Tangled up in blue

La                   Sol/La
She was working in a topless place
    La                 Sol/La
And I stopped in for a beer
   La                      Sol/La
I just kept looking at the side of her face
       Re
In the spotlight so clear
    La                Sol/La
And later on when the crowd thinned out
      La                   Sol/La
I was just about to do the same
        La                Sol/La
She was standing there in back of my chair
             Re
Said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
Mi                        Fa#m
I muttered something underneath my breath
    La                      Re
She studied the lines on my face
  Mi                  Fa#m
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
        La                    Re
When she bent down to tie the laces
      Mi
Of my shoe
Sol     Re    La  La4  La  La4  La  La4  La  La4
Tangled up in blue

La                 Sol/La
She lit a burner on the stove
    La           Sol/La
and offered me a pipe
   La                         Sol/La
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said,
     Re
"You look like the silent type"
         La          Sol/La
Then she opened up a book of poems
    La           Sol/La
And handed it to me
La             Sol/La
Written by an Italian poet
         Re
From the thirteenth century
    Mi                Fa#m
And every one of them words rang true
    La                  Re
And glowed like burning coal
Mi             Fa#m
Pouring off of every page
        La                Re
Like it was written in my soul
           Mi
From me to you
Sol     Re    La  La4  La  La4  La  La4  La  La4

  La                 Sol/La
I lived with them on Montague street
La                     Sol/La
In a basement down the stairs
          La             Sol/La
There was music in the caf√©s at night
        Re
And revolution in the air
     La                  Sol/La
Then he started into dealing with slaves
    La                      Sol/La
And something inside of him died
La                   Sol/La
She had to sell everything she owned
    Re
And froze up inside
    Mi                  Fa#m
And when it finally the bottom fell out
La            Re
I became withdrawn
    Mi                Fa#m
The only thing I knew how to do
    La                 Re
Was to keep on keeping on
                 Mi
Like a bird that flew
Sol     Re    La  La4  La  La4  La  La4  La  La4
Tangled up in blue

   La            Sol/La
So now I'm going back again
         La             Sol/La
I got to get to her somehow
La                Sol/La
All the people we used to know
             Re
They're an illusion to me now
La              Sol/La
Some are mathematicians
La                   Sol/La
Some are carpenter's wives
       La                 Sol/La
Don't know how it all got started
             Re
I don't know what they do with their lives
    Mi           Fa#m
But me I'm still on the road
  La                  Re
A-heading for another joint
   Mi         Fa#m
We always did feel the same
        La                  Re
We just saw it from a different point
   Mi
Of view
