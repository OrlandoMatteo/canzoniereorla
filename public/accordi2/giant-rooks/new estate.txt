[<pre>Fa#                                    Do#
 She's been out for a week or a little more
 Fa#                                         Do#
Again and again and again counting all these hours at night
Fa#                       La#m
 A single cloud is passing by
             Do#                        Fa#      Do#
Right in the moon behind the way she always said
Fa#                                   Do#
You spin fast in a road that i didn't count?
     Fa#                               Do#
From time to time it felt like we have chosen different roads
Fa#                     La#m      Do#               Fa#
 Oh the future is gonna be a new estate for you and me
                         Do#
At least, at least in your eyes

Oh I swear

Fa#                             Do#   Re#m
Down to the upper side I can see ghost towns
             La#m
Oh until the morning glows
Re#m            La#m     Fa7               La#m
Read it in your eyes I believe in my whole lies
Fa#  Do#
Oh

Fa#                         Do#
She's been out for sick and change
     Fa#
In a land where milk and honey flows
             Do#      Fa#
Through all our veins
                             La#m
What does an old picture tell
               Do#               Fa#
I thought i've always stayed the same

At least in your eyes

Fa#                             Do#   Re#m
Down to the upper side I can see ghost towns
             La#m
Oh until the morning glows
Re#m            La#m     Fa7               La#m
Read it in your eyes I believe in my whole lies

Re#m            La#m     Fa7               La#m
Read it in your eyes I believe in my whole lies
Fa#  Do# Re#m  La#m  Re#m  La#m  Fa7
Huh

Fa#  Do# Re#m  La#m  Re#m  La#m  Fa7  La#m

            La#m
Nothing can hold us

Same way as you can't leave us alone

It's easy one more step and my head is gone
  Fa#  Do#                  Fam      La#m
Serena, all I need and all I want you to
  Fa#     Do#            Fam     La#m     Fa7
Believe me all I need and want you to

Oh i swear

Down to the upper side I can see ghost towns
             La#m
Oh until the morning glows
Re#m            La#m     Fa7               La#m
Read it in your eyes I believe in my whole lies

Oh oh

Fa#   Re#m La#m  Re#m  La#m  Fa7  La#m

      Fa#            La#m
Can't read it in your eyes
       Fa7          La#m
In the dead of the night
        Fa#            La#m
I can't read it in your eyes
    Fa7               La#m
I believe in my whole lies
