Sol               Lam   Re     Re7
I’m dreaming of a white Christmas,
Do                 Lam           Sol        Sol4  Sol
Just like the ones I used to know.
 Sol              Sol             Sol7
Where the tree tops glisten,
      Do              Dom
And children listen,
  Sol              Mim             Lam      Re   Re7
To hear the sleigh bells in the snow.

Do            Lam             Sol      Sol4  Sol
With every Christmas card I write.
         Sol        Sol7        Do     Dom
May your days be merry and bright,
      Sol    Mim    Lam      Re       Sol
And may all your Christmases be white.
