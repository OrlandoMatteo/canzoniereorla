 Lam                    Mim   Fa   Do
Bury all your secrets in my skin
 Lam                        Mim  Fa                   Do
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
 Lam                         Mim       Fa   Do
The air around me still feels like a cage
 Lam                           Mim   Fa                     Do
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again…

So if you love me, let me go. And run away before I know.
                             Sol                               Lam
My heart is just too dark to care. I can't destroy what isn't there.
                    Sol                            Lam
Deliver me into my Fate - If I'm alone I cannot hate
                       Sol
I don't deserve to have you…
    Fa                                                     Lam
My smile was taken long ago / If I can change I hope I never know

    Lam                   Mim      Fa   Do 
I still press your letters to my lips
     Lam                        Mim     Fa              Do
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
   Lam                         Mim    Fa    Do
I couldn't face a life without your light
    Lam                            Mim   Fa                   Do
But all of that was ripped apart… when you refused to fight


                                Sol                              Lam 
So save your breath, I will not hear. I think I made it very clear.
                          Sol                                 Lam
You couldn't hate enough to love. Is that supposed to be enough?
                            Sol                                   Lam
I only wish you weren't my friend. Then I could hurt you in the end.
                          Sol
I never claimed to be a Saint…
    Fa                                                            Lam
My own was banished long ago / It took the Death of Hope to let you go

So Break Yourself Against My Stones
                         Lam
And Spit Your Pity In My Soul
                     Sol
You Never Needed Any Help
                         Lam
You Sold Me Out To Save Yourself
                       Sol
And I Won't Listen To Your Shame
                            Lam
You Ran Away - You're All The Same
                   Sol
Angels Lie To Keep Control…

My Love Was Punished Long Ago
