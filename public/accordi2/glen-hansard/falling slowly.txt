Do                 Fa              Do                Fa
I don't know you, but I want you all the more for that
Do                         Fa               Do             Fa
Words fall through me and always fool me, and I can't react


Lam      Sol      Fa       Sol                Lam        Sol              Fa
Games that never amount to more than they're meant will play themselves out


Do                 Fa                 Lam                     Fa
Take this sinking boat and point it home, we've still got time
Do                  Fa                 Lam                     Fa
Raise your hopeful voice, you had the choice, you've made it now


Do               Fa               Do              Fa
Falling slowly, eyes that know me, and I can't go back
Do                  Fa             Do               Fa
Moods that take me and erase me, and I'm painted black


Lam       Sol        Fa        Sol              Lam        Sol            Fa
You have suffered enough and warred with yourself, it's time that you won


Do                 Fa                 Lam                    Fa
Take this sinking boat and point it home, we've still got time
Do                  Fa                  Lam                     Fa
Raise your hopeful voice, you had the choice, you've made it now



Lam Sol Fa Sol Lam Sol Fa


Do                 Fa                 Lam                    Fa
Take this sinking boat and point it home, we've still got time
Do                  Fa                  Lam                     Fa
Raise your hopeful voice, you had the choice, you've made it now
Do              Fa             Lam             Fa
Falling slowly sing your melody, I'll sing along
