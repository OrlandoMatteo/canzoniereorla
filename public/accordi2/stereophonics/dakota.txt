Mi                           Do#m
 Thinking back, thinking of you

Summertime think it was June
                   Mi
Yeah think it was June
                          Do#m
Laying back, head on the grass

Chewing gum having some laughs

 Drinking back, drinking for two

Drinking with you
                   Mi
When drinking was new
                            Do#m7
Sleeping in the back of my car
               Laadd9
We never went far
                   Mi
Didn't need to go far

  Wake up call, coffee and juice
             La
Remembering you
                  Mi
What happened to you?
                         Do#m
I wonder if we’ll meet again
                       La
Talk about life since then
                       Mi
Talk about why did it end
