I should have stayed at home
Mi7                                               
'Cause right now I see all these people that love 
                La
me but I still feel alone
               La6       Si
Can't help but check my phone
Mi
I could have made you mine
          Mi7                                     
But no it wasn't meant to be and see I wasn't made
                         La
for you and you weren't made for me
          La6        Si
Though it seemed so easy...

You need to be yourself
       Mi7                             
Love someone for loving you instead of 
                                    La
someone really cool that makes your heart melt
                La6       Si
Who knows what you truly felt
                Mi
You're still my favourite girl
           Mi7                                      
You better trust me when I tell you there ain't no
