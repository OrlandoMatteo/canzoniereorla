       Do#m Si  La Si    Do#m Si  Fa#m7 La

Do#m      Si                La       Si
 One more kiss could be the best thing
Do#m          Si               La    Si
 But one more lie could be the worst
Do#m           Si                 La      Si
 And all these thoughts are never resting
Do#m        Si                La    Si
 And you're not something I deserve
Do#m  Si           Sol#m La
In my head there's only  you now
Mi         Fa#m7   La
This world falls on me
Do#m    Si            Sol#m    La
In this world there's real and make believe
    Mi         Fa#m7  Readd9
And this seems real  to me

Mi   Si              Do#m       La     Do#m
 You love me but you don't know who I am
            Si               Do#m     La
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
Mi       Si              Do#m       La      Do#m
 And you love me but you don't know who I am
   Si     Sol#m
So let me go
La      Do#m Si  La Si   Do#m Si  Fa#m7 Sol#m7 La
Let me go

Do#m       Si              La    Si
 I dream ahead to what I hope for
Do#m           Si             La   Si
 And I turn my back on loving you
Do#m     Si              La    Si
 How can this love be a good thing
Do#m         Si          La    Si
 When I know what I'm goin through
Do#m  Si           Sol#m La
In my head there's only  you now
Mi         Fa#m7   La
This world falls on me
Do#m    Si            Sol#m    La
In this world there's real and make believe
    Mi         Fa#m7  Readd9
And this seems real  to me

Mi   Si              Do#m       La     Do#m
 You love me but you don't know who I am
            Si               Do#m     La
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
Mi       Si              Do#m       La      Do#m
 And you love me but you don't know who I am
   Si     Sol#m
So let me go
La      Do#m Mi  Si La  Do#m Mi  Si La
Let me go...

    Do#m          Mi
And no matter how hard I try
  Si                  La            Do#m  Mi
I can't escape these things inside I know
 Si    La
I knowww..
     Do#m           Mi
When all the pieces fall apart
    Si           La       Do#m     Mi
You will be the only one who knows
 Si    La  Mi
Who knows

    Si              Do#m       La     Do#m
You love me but you don't know who I am
            Si               Do#m     La
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
Mi       Si              Do#m       La      Do#m
 And you love me but you don't know who I am
   Si     Sol#m
So let me go

And you love me but you don't
    La                Do#m
You love me but you don't

You love me but you don't know me
