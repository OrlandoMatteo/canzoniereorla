       Lam   Do Sol    Lam   Do Sol

         Lam
There's another world inside of me
      Do           Sol
That you may never see
          Lam
There are secrets in this life
             Do   Sol
That I can't hide
Lam
Somewhere in this darkness
          Do                 Sol
There's a light that I can't find
Lam                 Do  Sol
Maybe it's too far away
                  Lam    La4
Or maybe I'm just blind
                  Lam
Or maybe I'm just blind

                    Lam
So hold me when I'm here

Right me when I'm wrong
                 Re5
Hold me when I'm scared
            Sol
And love me when I'm gone
             Lam
Everything I am

And everything in me
                Re5
Wants to be the one
           Sol
You wanted me to be
                   Lam
I'll never let you down

Even if I could
                 Re5
I'd give up everything
          Sol
If only for your good
                    Lam
So hold me when I'm here

Right me when I'm wrong
                         Re5
You can hold me when I'm scared
             Sol
You won't always be there
                Lam      Do Sol
So love me when I'm gone
             Lam     Do Sol
Love me when I'm gone

          Lam
When your education X-Ray
       Do         Sol
Cannot see under my skin
  Lam
I won't tell you a damn thing
       Do              Sol
That I could not tell my friends
Lam7
Roaming through this darkness
    Do              Sol
I'm alive but I'm alone
Lam7
Part of me is fighting this
    Do            Sol
But part of me is gone

                    Lam
So hold me when I'm here
