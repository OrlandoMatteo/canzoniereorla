          Sim
A hundred days have made me older
          La                                      Sim  Sol  La
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face
           Sim
A thousand lies have made me colder
      La                                        Sim  Sol  La
And I don't think I can look at this the same
Sim                          La
But all the miles that seperate
Sim                           Sol                La
They dissapear now, when I'm dreaming of your face


Re                              La
I'm here without you, baby
                                    Sim
But you're still on my lonely mind
                         Sol           La                       Re
I think about you, baby, and I dream about you all the time
                            La
I'm here without you, baby
                               Sim
But you're still with me in my dreams
        Sol    La                    Sim   La    Sim  Sol  La
And tonight, there's only you and me, yeah


    Sim
The miles just keep rollin'
       La                                    Sim  Sol  La
As the people leave their way to say hello
                Sim
I've heard this life is overrated
      La                              Sim      Sol    La
But I hope that it gets better as we go, ohh yeah yeah

Sim                 Re
Everything I know, and anywhere I go
La                         Sol
It gets hard but it won't take away my love
Sim                           Re
And when the last one falls, and when it's all said and done
La                           Sol            Sol
It gets hard, but it won't take away my love, whoa
