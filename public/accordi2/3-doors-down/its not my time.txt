       Lam Domaj7  Fa    Lam Domaj7  Fa

       Lam Sol Fa  Do  Sol

       Lam Sol Fa  Do  Sol

Faadd9
 Looking back at the beginning of this
Lam                 Faadd9
 And how life was

Just you and me in love and all of our friends
Lam                          Faadd9
Living life like an ocean

But now the current's only pulling me down
Lam                             Faadd9
It's getting harder to breathe

It won't be too long and I will be going under
Lam
 Can you save me from this?

            Lam Sol Fa           Do
'Cause it's not my  time I'm not going
                  Sol
There's a fear in me it's not showing
     Lam   Sol    Fa
This could be the end of me
    Do           Sol
And everything I know
               Famaj7   Lam
Oh but I won't go

Faadd9
 I look ahead to all the plans that we made
Lam                         Faadd9
 And the dreams that we had

I'm in a world that tries to take them away
 Lam                         Faadd9
Oh but I'm taking them back

'Cause all of this time
                                  Lam
I've just been too blind to understand
                           Faadd9
What should matter to me

My friend, this life we live, it's not what we have
Lam
  It's what we believe in

            Lam Sol Fa           Do
'Cause it's not my  time I'm not going
                  Sol
There's a fear in me it's not showing
     Lam   Sol    Fa
This could be the end of me
    Do           Sol
And everything I know
            Lam Sol Fa           Do
'Cause it's not my  time I'm not going
                  Sol
There's a fear in me it's not showing
     Lam   Sol    Fa
This could be the end of me
    Do           Sol
And everything I know
               Famaj7  Do  Sol
Oh but I won't go
         Fa  Do  Sol
I won't go

Fa               Do             Sol
 There might be more than you believe
                                Fa
(There might be more than you believe)
                Do            Sol
There might be more than you can see

                   Fa           Do
'Cause it's not my time I'm not going
                  Sol
There's a fear in me it's not showing
     Lam   Sol    Fa
This could be the end of me
    Do           Sol
And everything I know
            Lam Sol Fa           Do
'Cause it's not my  time I'm not going
                  Sol
There's a fear in me it's not showing
     Lam   Sol    Fa
This could be the end of me
    Do           Sol
And everything I know
Fa               Do             Sol
 There might be more than you believe
                                Fa
(There might be more than you believe)
                Do            Sol
There might be more than you can see
            Famaj7
But I won't go
     Lam       Famaj7    Lam
No I won't go down...
