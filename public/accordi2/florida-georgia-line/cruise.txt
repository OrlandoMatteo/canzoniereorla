Baby you a song 
    Re                         Mim7               Do

When I first saw that bikini top on her 
Mim7                                   Do
She's poppin' right out of the South Georgia water 
Sol                                     Re
Thought ol' good lord she had them long tanned legs 
Mim7                          Do
Couldn't help myself so I walked up and said

Down a back road blowin stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you

Sol                        Re
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit

She was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker 
Mim7                                   Do
We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer 
Sol                                       Re
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said 
Mim7                                    Do

Sol                                 Re
When that summer sun fell to it's knees
Mim7                           Do
I looked at her and she looked at me 
Sol                               Re
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night 

Cuz it felt so right, her and I, man we felt so right

Sol
I put it in park 
Re
and grabbed my guitar 
Mim7
and strummed a couple chords 
 Do
and sang from the heart

Sol                                 Re
Girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin' 
Mim7                               Do
Hell I can't get you out of my head
