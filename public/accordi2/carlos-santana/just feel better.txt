         Fam7
part of me says let it go
          Sol#
that life happens for a reason
La#

         Fam7
'cause i never went before

                     Fam7

      La#
and i can't find my way
             Fam7

         Sol#
and i'll do anything to just feel better
      Dom

                       Re#
she said i need you to hold me
             Fam
i'm a little far from the shore
    Sol#                   Dom
and i'm afraid of sinking
                        Re#
you're the only one who knows me
        Fam
and who doesn't ignore
Sol#
that my soul is weaping
La#
i know i know i know
        Fam7
part of me says let it go
     Sol#
everything must have it's season
 La#
'round, and 'round it goes
          Fam7
and every day's the one before
     Sol#
but this time, this time
                                        Re#

                     Fam7
you know i can't see through the haze around me

         Sol#
and i'll do anything to just feel better

   Re#                         La#    Solm
