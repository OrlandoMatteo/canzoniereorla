        Lam  Doadd9  Sol  Re

        Lam  Doadd9  Sol  Re

       Lam                           Do
Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell,
       Sol                         Re
It was love from above, that could save me from hell,
        Lam                     Do
She had fire in her soul it was easy to see,
        Sol                    Re
How the devil himself could be pulled out of me,
           Lam                     Do
There were drums in the air as she started to dance,
      Sol                      Re
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands,

And we sang...

Lam         Do
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay,
        Sol                  Re
And the voices rang like the angels sing,

We're singing...
Lam         Do
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay,
       Sol         Re
And we danced on into the night,
         Lam
Ay oh ay oh,
         Do
Ay oh ay oh,
       Sol         Re
And we danced on into the night,

       Lam                      Do
Like a piece to the puzzle that falls into place,
          Sol                       Re
You could tell how we felt from the look on our faces,
        Lam7                         Do
We were spinning in circles with the moon in our eyes,
   Sol                     Re
No room left to move in between you and I,
      Lam                      Do
We forgot where we were and we lost track of time,
       Sol                    Re
And we sang to the wind as we danced through the night,

And we sang...

Lam         Do
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay,
        Sol                  Re
And the voices rang like the angels sing,

We're singing...
Lam         Do
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay,
       Sol         Re
And we danced on into the night,
         Lam
Ay oh ay oh,
         Do
Ay oh ay oh,
       Sol         Re
And we danced on into the night,
         Lam
Ay oh ay oh,
         Do
Ay oh ay oh,
       Sol         Re
And we danced on into the night,

Lam  Do  Sol  Re    Lam  Do  Sol  Re

Lam  Do  Sol  Re    Lam  Do  Sol  Re

Lam  Do

       Lam
Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell,

It was love from above, that could save me from hell,
    Lam7
She had fire in her soul it was easy to see,

How the devil himself could be pulled out of me,
           Lam                     Do
There were drums in the air as she started to dance,
       Sol                     Re
Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands,

         Do
Ay oh ay oh,
       Sol         Re
And we danced on into the night,

Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay,

(Ay oh ay oh),
Sol         Re
Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay,

(Ay oh ay oh),
        Lam         Do
Singing ay oh ay oh ay oh ay,

(Ay oh ay oh),
       Sol         Re            Lam
And we danced on into the night...
