Si    Fa#4       Sol#m7
 This time, This place
  Miadd9   Si
Misused, Mistakes
    Fa#4      Sol#m7
Too long, Too late

Just one chance
         Sol#m7
Just one breath
         Miadd9                Do#
Just in case there's just one left

I keep dreaming you'll be with me
                  Si

     Fa#
Stop breathing if
Sol#m7    Miadd9

Last chance for one last dance
             Fa#4         Sol#m7
'Cause with you, I'd withstand
        Miadd9            Si
All of hell to hold your hand
             Fa#4
I'd give it all
             Sol#m7
I'd give for us
         Miadd9                 Do#
Give anything but I won't give up

'Cause you know,
