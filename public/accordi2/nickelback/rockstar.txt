I'm through with standing in line

To clubs we'll never get in
              Do
It's like the bottom of the ninth

And I'm never gonna win
     Fa
This life hasn't turned out quite the way
              Sol
I want it to be

(Tell me what you want)

I want a brand new house

      Do
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
      Fa                                     Sol
And a king size tub big enough for ten plus me

(So what you need?)

I'll need aâ€”a credit card that's got no limit
      Do
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
      Fa                                                Sol
Gonna join the mile high club at thirty-seven thousand feet

(Been there, done that)

I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
       Do
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
     Fa                                            Sol
Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me

(So how you gonna do it?)

I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
         Do
I'd even cut my hair and change my name

          Solm
'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
            La#
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars

Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
       Fa                                           Sol
Sign a couple autographs so I can eat my meals for free

I'm gonna dress my ass with the latest fashion
      Do
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
      Fa                                                 Sol
