       Do#m7  Miadd9  Si  Fa#

                 Do#m7   Miadd9
Well, I know the feeling
               Si                      Fa#
Of finding yourself stuck out on the ledge
                   Do#m7    Miadd9
And there ain't no healing
                  Si                   Fa#
From cutting yourself with the jagged edge
                Do#m7
I'm telling you that
                Miadd9
It's never that bad
              Si                              Fa#
Take it from someone who's been where you're at
         Miadd9
Laid out on the floor

And you're not sure
        Fa#
You can take this anymore

                Do#m7
So just give it one more try
     Miadd9
To a lullaby
    Si                  Fa#
And turn this up on the radio
           Do#m7
If you can hear me now
    Miadd9
I'm reaching out
   Si                           Fa#
To let you know that you're not alone
       Do#m7
And if you can't tell
    Miadd9
I'm scared as hell
         Si                   Fa#
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
        Miadd9            Fa#
So just close your eyes
                         Do#m7   Miadd9
Well, honey here comes a lullaby
              Si       Fa#
Your very own lullaby

              Do#m7     Miadd9
Please let me take you
           Si                      Fa#
Out of the darkness and into the light
              Do#m7       Miadd9
'Cause I have faith in you
                  Si                        Fa#
That you're gonna make it through another night
               Do#m7
Stop thinking about
             Miadd9
The easy way out
                   Si                      Fa#
There's no need to go and blow the candle out
         Miadd9
Because you're not done

You're far too young
        Fa#
And the best is yet to come

                Do#m7
So just give it one more try
     Miadd9
To a lullaby
    Si                  Fa#
And turn this up on the radio
           Do#m7

Well, honey here comes a lullaby
              Si       Fa#
Your very own lullaby

Si                               Sol#m7
 Well, everybody's hit the bottom
                              Miadd9
And everybody's been forgotten
                                  Si
When everybody's tired of being alone
                                 Sol#m7
Yeah, everybody's been abandoned
                               Miadd9
And left a little empty-handed
                                      Fa#4  Fa#
So if you're out there barely hanging on

                Do#m7
So just give it one more try
     Miadd9
To a lullaby
    Si                  Fa#
And turn this up on the radio
           Do#m7
If you can hear me now

        Miadd9            Fa#
So just close your eyes
                         Do#m7  Miadd9
Well, honey here comes a lullaby
              Si       Fa#
Your very own lullaby
