La#m        Fa#add9     Sol#
 One more depending on a prayer
                 La#m
And we all look away
          Fa#add9     Sol#
People pretending everywhere
                   La#m
It's just another day
                Soladd9             Sol#
There's bullets flying through the air
                      La#m
And they still carry on
            Fa#add9     Sol#
We watch it happen over there

And then just turn it off

La#m       Fa#add9    Sol#
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah

We must stand together
La#m       Fa#add9    Sol#
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah

There's no giving in
La#m       Fa#add9    Sol#
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah

Hand in hand forever
La#m       Fa#add9    Sol#
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah

That's when we all win
La#m       Fa#add9    Sol#
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
                                La#m  Fa#add9  Sol#
That's, that's, that's when we all win
                                La#m  Fa#add9  Sol#
That's, that's, that's when we all win

La#m          Fa#add9       Sol#
 They tell us everything's alright
                La#m
And we just go along
            Fa#add9      Sol#
How can we fall asleep at night
                         La#m
When something's clearly wrong
              Fa#add9        Sol#
When we could feed a starving world
                   La#m
With what we throw away
           Fa#add9        Sol#
But all we serve are empty words

That always taste the same

La#m       Fa#add9    Sol#
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah

We must stand together
La#m       Fa#add9    Sol#
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah

There's no giving in
La#m       Fa#add9    Sol#
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah

Hand in hand forever
La#m       Fa#add9    Sol#
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah

That's when we all win
La#m       Fa#add9    Sol#
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
                                La#m  Fa#add9  Sol#
That's, that's, that's when we all win
                                Fa#
That's, that's, that's when we all win

                   Re#m
The right thing to guide us
                 La#m
Is right here inside us
             Sol#
No one can divide us
                         Fa#
When the light is nearly gone
                Sol#
But just like a heartbeat
                      La#m
The drumbeat carries on

La#m       Fa#add9    Sol#
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah

We must stand together
La#m       Fa#add9    Sol#
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah

There's no giving in
La#m       Fa#add9    Sol#
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah

Hand in hand forever
La#m       Fa#add9    Sol#
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah

That's when we all win
La#m       Fa#add9    Sol#
Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah
                                La#m  Fa#add9  Sol#
That's, that's, that's when we all win
                                La#m  Fa#add9  Sol#
That's, that's, that's when we all win
