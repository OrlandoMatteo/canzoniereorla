   Look at this Photograph, everytime I do it makes me laugh,
                             Laadd9                               Mi
   How did our eyes get so red, and what the hell is on joeys head
                             Si4                                    Readd9
   And this is where I grew up, I think the present owner fixed it up,
                                Laadd9                                    Mi
  I never knew we ever went without,the second floor is high for sneakin out
                                Si4                                       Readd9
and this is where I went to school, most of the time had better things to do
                                  Laadd9                               Mi
Criminal record says I broke in twice, I must have done half a dozen times
                            Si4                                  Readd9
     I wander if it's too late, should I go back and try to graduate,
                                    Laadd9                              Soladd9
Life's better now than it was back then, if I was them I would'nt let me in!
          Laadd9
Oh Oh Oh... Oh God I!

       Mi                                            Si
 Every memory of lookin out the back door, I had the photo album spread
                              Readd9                        Laadd9
out on my bedroom floor, It's hard to say it, time to say it, Good-bye!

Good-bye!
       Mi                                               Si
 Every memory of walkin out the front door, I found the photo of the friend
                             Readd9                         Laadd9
that I was looking for, It's hard to say it, time to say it, Good-Bye! Good-

Bye!

Mi                   Si4                                 Readd9
 Remember the old arcade? Blew ever dollar that we ever made
                            Laadd9                                    Mi
 The cops hated us hanging out They said somebody went and burned it down
                             Si4                                     Readd9
 We used to listen to the radio, and sing along to every song we'd know,
                                         Laadd9
 We said someday we'd find out how it feels, to sing to more than just the
             Mi
 steering wheel
                         Si4                                     Readd9
 Kim's the first girl I kissed, I was so nervous that I nearly missed,
                                      Laadd9
 She's had a couple of kids since then, I haven't seen her since god knows
  Soladd9         Laadd9
 when!  Oh Oh Oh... Oh God I!

Mi             Si4               Soladd9
  I miss that town I miss their faces
              Laadd9            Mi
  You can't erase  You can't replace it
             Si4            Soladd9
  I miss it now  I can't believe it
              Laadd9             Mi
  So hard to stay  Too hard to leave it
                           Si4
  If I could relive those days
                                          Soladd9
  I know the one thing that would never change
