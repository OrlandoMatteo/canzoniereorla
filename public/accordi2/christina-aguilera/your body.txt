         Fa# Sol#m
I came here tonight
            Si         Do#m
To get shit out of my mind
          Mi           Fa#   Re#m Mi
I'm gonna take what I find
        Fa# Sol#m
So open the box
              Si        Do#m
Don't need no key I'm unlocked
            Mi          Fa#    Re#m Mi
And I won't tell you to stop

Hey boy!
        Fa#    Sol#m
I don't need to know where you've been
Si             Do#m
 All I need to know is you and
Mi        Fa#         Re#m Mi
 no need for talking

Hey boy!
      Fa#      Sol#m
So don't even tell me your name
Si             Do#m
 All I need to know is whose place
Mi            Fa#      Re#m Mi
 And let's get walking

    Fa# Sol#m  Si        Do#m     Mi Fa#  Re#m Mi
All I  wanna do is love your body...
          Fa#  Sol#m      Si

     Mi        Fa#  Sol#m
It's true what you heard
       Si             Do#m
I am a freak, I'm disturbed
               Mi           Fa#    Re#m Mi
So come on and give me your worst
                    Fa#  Sol#m
We're moving faster then slow
             Si            Do#m
If you don't know where to go
            Mi        Fa#   Re#m Mi
I'll finish off on my own

Hey boy!
        Fa#    Sol#m
I don't need to know where you've been
Si             Do#m
 All I need to know is you and
