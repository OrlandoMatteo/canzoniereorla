Mim               Re
How could this man I thought I knew
Do             Si
 Turn out to be unjust so cruel
Lam         Sol6
 Could only see the good in you
Si7
Pretend not to see the truth
Mim             Re                Do
 You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself
        Si7          Lam
Through living in denial

But in the end you’ll see
