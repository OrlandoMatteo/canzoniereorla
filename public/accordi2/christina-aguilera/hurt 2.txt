Mim                     Si/Re#                      Mim
Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face
                      Do                          Lam
You told me how proud you were, but I walked away
                      Si
If only I knew what I know today
Mim
Ooooooo


I would hold you in my arms
La/Do#
I would take the pain away
Re
Thank you for all you've done
Si/Re#
Forgive all your mistakes
Do
There's nothing I wouldn't do
La/Do#
to hear your voice again
Re
Sometimes I wanna call you
Si/Re#
But I know you won't be there


Mim      Si/Re#            Mim
Woah, I'm sorry for, blaming you
         Do                Lam
For everything, I couldn't do
                  Si
and I hurt myself, by hurting you


Mim               Si/Re#                     Mim
Some days I feel broke inside but I won't admit
                       Do                    Lam
Sometimes I just wanna hide cause it's you I miss
                                Si
And it's so hard to say goodbye, when it comes to this
Mim
Oooooo


Do
Would you tell me I was wrong
La/Do#
Would you help me understand
Re
Are you looking down upon me
Si/Re#
Are you proud of who I am
Do
There's nothing I wouldn't do
La/Do#
To have just one more chance
Re
To look into your eyes
Si/Re#
And see you looking back


Mim     Si/Re#                   Mim
Woah, I'm sorry for, blaming you
               Do                  Lam
For everything, I just couldn't do
                  Si
And I hurt myself, for hurting you


                       Do
If I had just one more day
        Mim                                                        Do
I would tell you how much that I've missed you since you've been away
    Lam            Mi                  Lam
And oh, it's dangerous And so out of line
                     Si            Mim
To try and turn back time


Mim     Si/Re#                   Mim
Woah, I'm sorry for, blaming you
               Do                  Lam
For everything, I just couldn't do
                  Si
And I hurt myself, for hurting you
            Mim
By hurting you</pre>]
