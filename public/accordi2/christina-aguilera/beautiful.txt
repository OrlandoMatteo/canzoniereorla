  Everyday is so wonderful.
           Dom              Si
Then suddenly, it's hard to breath.
Re#                  Re#/Do#
  Now and then i get insecure
             Dom           Si
From all the pain. I'm so ashamed.

Sol#                 Fam
  I am beautiful no matter what they say,
Mim         Re#/Do#  Dom
Words can't bring me down.
Sol#                 Fam
  I am beautiful in every single way,
Re#         Re#/Do#  Dom
Words can't bring me down.
Fam                            Re#  Re#7  Dom  Si
  So don't you bring me down today.

  To all your friends you're delirious
      Dom               Si
So consumed in all your doom.
Re#                       Re#/Do#
  Trying hard to fill the emptiness
           Dom                Si
The pieces gone, the puzzles' left undone

That's the way it is.

Sol#                 Fam
  I am beautiful no matter what they say,
Mim         Re#/Do#  Dom
Words can't bring me down.
Sol#                 Fam

  No matter what we do
                  Dom
No matter what we say
                               Si
We'll sing the song inside the tune

Full of beautiful mistakes.

Re#                 Re#/Do#
  And everywhere we go
                    Dom
The sun will always shine
                      Si
And tomorrow we might wake up on the other side.

Sol#                   Fam
  We are beautiful no matter what they say
Re#         Re#/Do#  Dom
Words can't bring us down.

Fam
  So don't you bring us down today.
