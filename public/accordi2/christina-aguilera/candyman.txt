Mi
Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine

Candyman, Candyman

Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine

Sweet sugar candy man [whispered]

  Mi
I met him out for dinner on a Friday night

He really had me working up an appetite
   La7
He had tattoos up and down his arm
        Mi
There's nothing more dangerous than a boy with charm
       Si7                      La7
He's a one stop shop, makes the panties drop
       Mi
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar coated candy man

A sweet-talkin', sugar coated candyman

Oh yeah..

   Mi
He took me to the Spider Club at Hollywood and Vine

We drank champagne and we danced all night
   La7
We shook the paparazzi for a big surprise
    Mi
the gossip tonight will be tomorrow's headline
       Si7                     La7
He's a one stop shop, makes my cherry pop
       Mi
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar coated candy man

A sweet-talkin', sugar coated candyman

Se bop bop
             La7   Mi
Hey yeah
           Si7                 La7
He's a one stop shop, makes my cherry pop
       Mi
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar coated candy man oh

A sweet-talkin', sugar coated candyman

Woo yeah

Mi
Well by now I'm getting all bothered and hot

When he kissed my mouth he really hit the spot
       La7
He had lips like sugar cane
Mi
Good things come to boys who wait

Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine

Candy man, candy man

Sipping from a bottle of vodka double wine

Candy man, candy man

Sweet sugar candy man

He's a one stop, gotcha hot, making all the panties drop

Sweet sugar candy man

He's a one stop, got me hot, making my uh pop

Sweet sugar candy man

He's a one stop, get it while it's hot, baby don't stop

Sweet sugar

       La7
He got those lips like sugar cane
Mi
Good things come for boys who wait
       Si7                  La7
He's a one stop shop with a real big uh
       Mi
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar coated candyman

He's a sweet-talkin', sugar coated candyman

He's a sweet-talkin', sugar coated candyman

He's a sweet-talkin', sugar coated candyman

Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine ...

Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine ...

Jane lost her grip and a-down she fell ...

Squared herself away as she let out a yell ...
