Laadd9
 I just wanna be alone tonight
Si4
 I just wanna take a little breather
Laadd9
 Cause lately all we do is fight
Si4
 And every time it cuts me deeper
Do#m7
 Cause something’s changed
            Laadd9
You’ve been acting so strange
        Si
And its taking its toll on me
Do#m7                     Laadd9            Si
 Its safe to say that I’m ready to let you leave

        Mi     Si                       La
Without you, I live it up a little more everyday
        Mi       Si              La
Without you, I’m seein myself so differently
         Mi               Si
I didn’t wanna believe it then
           Mi/Sol#           La
But it all worked out in the end
       Si
When I watched you walk away
       Do#m
Well I never thought I'd say
    Re
I’m fine
        La   Mi  Si
Without you

Laadd9
 Called you up cause’ it’s been long enough
Si4
 And you said that you were so much better
Laadd9
 We have done a lot of growing up
Si4
 We were never meant to be together
Do#m7                              Laadd9
 Cause something changed, you were acting so strange
         Si
And it’s taken its toll on me
Do#m7                      Laadd9           Si
