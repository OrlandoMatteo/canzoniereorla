 Honey why you calling me  so late?
La4                 Sim         Sol  Re
 It's kinda hard to talk right now
La4                Sim            Sol      Re
 Honey why are you crying? Is everything okay?
La4                       Sim             Sol
 I gotta whisper 'cause I can't be too loud
    Re            La
Well, my girl's in the next room
Sim          Sol
 Sometimes I wish she was you
Re          La                 Sim  Sol
 I guess we never really moved on

                    Re              La
It's really good to hear your voice saying my name
   Do        Sol
It sounds so sweet
                Re
Coming from the lips of an angel
La                     Do       Sol
Hearing those words it makes me weak

    Sim7                  La
And I never wanna say goodbye

 It's funny that you're calling me   tonight
La4             Sim             Sol  Re
 And, yes, I've dreams of you too
La4                      Sim
 And does he know you're talking to me
Sol              Re
 Will it start a fight
La4               Sim         Sol
 No I don't think she has a clue
