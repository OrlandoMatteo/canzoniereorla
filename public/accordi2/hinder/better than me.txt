       Rem9  Do  La#

Rem9             Do                  La#
 I think you can do much better than me
      Rem9              Do           La#
After all the lies that I made you believe
Rem9         Do                La#
 Guilt kicks in and I start to see
    Rem9
The edge of the bed
           Do                La#
Where your nightgown used to be
Rem       La#          Do
 I told myself I won't miss you
              Rem
But I remember
        La#          Do       La# La7sus4 Rem
What it feels like beside you
                   La#             Rem
I really miss your hair in my face
                 Do                Rem
And the way your innocence tastes
      La#              Do
And I think you should know this
                             Rem9  Do  La#
You deserve much better than me

Rem9  Do  La#

Rem            Do                      La#
 While looking through your old box of notes
              Rem
I found those pictures I took
     Do               La#    Rem
That you were looking for
               Do                     La#
If there's one memory I don't want to lose
     Rem
That time at the mall
        Do                 La#
You and me in the dressing room
Rem       La#          Do
 I told myself I won't miss you
              Rem
But I remember
        La#          Do        La# La7sus4 Rem
What it feels like beside you

                   La#            Rem
I really miss your hair in my face
                 Do              Rem
And the way your innocence tastes
      La#              Do
And I think you should know this
                             Solm7
You deserve much better than me
                                La#
The bed I'm lying in is getting colder
                                Fa
Wish I never would've said it's over
               Do       Solm7
And I can't pretend...
                                 La#
I won't think about you when I'm older
                              Fa
Cause we never really had our closure
                  Do    La7/Do#
This can't be the end

Rem                 La#            Rem
 I really miss your hair in my face
                 Do               Rem

      La#              Do
And I think you should know this
                             Rem
You deserve much better than me

I really miss your hair in my face
                 Do              Rem
