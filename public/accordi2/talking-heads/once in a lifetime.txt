And you may find yourself,  living in a shotgun shack
                         Fa#m                            La
And you may find yourself,  in another part of the world

    Fa#m                              La                Fa#m
And you may find yourself, in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife
        La                    Fa#m
And you may ask yourself, well,  how did I get here?

La           Re        Re/Fa#    Sol
 Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
La           Re        Re/Fa#  Sol
 Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
La        Re       Re/Fa#       Sol
 Into the blue again, after the money's gone
La         Re       Re/Fa# Sol          La
 Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground

                         Re/Fa#                    La
And you may ask yourself,    how do I work this?
                         Re/Fa#                          La
And you may ask yourself,    where is that large automobile?
                         Re/Fa#                          La
And you may tell yourself,    this is not my beautiful house
                         Re/Fa#

                        Re/Fa#                             Re/La
And you may ask yourself,  where does that highway go to?
                        Re/Fa#                      Re/La
And you may ask yourself,  am I right?  am I wrong?
                               Re/Fa#
And you may tell yourself,  My God, what have I done?

 same as it ever was,  same as it ever was...
