Sol       Fa
 Watch out, you might get what you're after
Sol         Fa
 Cool babies, strange but not a stranger
Sol     Fa       Sol
 I'm an ordinary guy
La7              Fa
Burning down the house
Sol          Fa
 Hold tight

Wait 'til the party's over
Sol        Fa
 Hold tight

We're in for nasty weather
Sol         Fa          Sol
  There has got to be a way
La7              Fa
Burning down the house

Solm
 Here's your ticket pack your bags
Fa
Time for jumpin' overboard
Solm                   Fa
 The transportation is here
Solm
Close enough but not too far,
Fa
Maybe you know where you are
Solm                Fa
 Fightin' fire with fire

Sol      Fa
 All wet, hey, you might need a raincoat
Sol       Fa
 Shakedown, dreams walking in broad daylight
Sol            Fa           Sol
 Three hundred sixty five degrees
La7              Fa
Burning down the house

Solm
It was once upon a place,
Fa
Sometimes I listen to myself
Solm                 Fa
 Gonna come in first place
Solm
People on their way to work,
Fa
Baby, what did you expect?
Solm              Fa
 Gonna burst into flame

Solm  Fa  Solm  Fa  Solm  Fa  Solm

La7              Fa
Burning down the house
Sol        Fa
 My house's out of the ordinary
Sol            Fa
 That's right

Don't want to hurt nobody
Sol                  Fa              Sol
Some things sure can sweep me off my feet
La7              Fa
Burning down the house

   Solm
No visible means of support
    Fa
And you have not seen nothin' yet
Solm                  Fa
 Everything's stuck together
    Solm
And I don't know what you expect
Fa
Staring into the TV set
Solm                 Fa
  Fighting fire with fire

Solm  Fa  Solm  Fa
