Lam
 Hey bro, take it slow
Fa
 You ain't livin' in a video
Do                                   Sol
 You're flying low with a high velocity
Lam
 No doubt, you're stressin' out
Fa
 That ain't what rock n' roll's about
Do                                     Sol
 Get off that one way trip down lonely street

Now I know you've been kicked around

 You ain't alone in this ugly town

You stick a needle in your arm
Fa                      Sol
 You bite the dust, you buy the farm

Fa
 Get your foot out of that grave
Do                                        Sol
 Don't let that one love tear your world apart
Lam
 C'mon babe, kick that stuff
Fa
 Show the street it ain't so tough
Do                                         Sol
 Quit lyin' around with a crippled, broken heart
    Lam                Rem
Now I know you've been seeing red
Fa                  Sol
 Don't put a pistol to your head
Lam                     Rem
sometimes your answer's heaven sent

 Your way is so damn permanent
