Well, I ain't evil, I'm just good lookin'

Run my greasy fingers

Up your greasy spine

Meet my libido

He's a psycho

Feed my Frankenstein

Hungry for love

And it's feeding time

Rem
 You don't want to talk
   Do/Re
So baby shut up

And let me drink the wine from your fur tea cup
              Do/Re
Velcro candy, sticky sweet
Sol/Re           Rem
Make my tattoos melt in the heat
        Lam
Well, I ain't no veggie
                     Sol
Like my flesh on the bone
 Lam
Alive and lickin' on your ice cream cone

Meet my libido

He's a psycho
