Re#m                                    Fa# Sol#
 I must have dreamed a thousand dreams,
                                 Do#
been hunted by a million screams
               Si               Sol# Re#m
I can hear the marching feet,

they're moving into the street
                                  Fa# Sol#
Now did you read the news today?
                                Do#
They say the danger's gone away
                  Si                    Sol# Re#m
But I can see the fire's still alight

burning into the night

        Do#      Re#m          Sol#
There's too many men, too many people
       Fa#     Re#m      Fa#
making too many problems,
    Do#                  Re#m    Fa#
and not much love to go around
Do#                      Fa#       Re#m     Fa# Do#
Can't you see, this is a land of confusion?

Re#m Si          Do#      La#m    Re#m
  So this is the world we live in,
    Si            Do#         La#m   Re#m
and these are the hands we're given
Si           Do#         La#m    Re#m
Use them and let's start trying
   Si        Do#         La#m   Sol#   Sol#m
to make it a place worth living in

Re#m                              Fa# Sol#
 Oh superman, where are you now,
                                      Do#
when everything's gone wrong somehow?
                Si        Sol#    Re#m
The man of steel, men of power

are losing control by the hour

Do#         Re#m  Fa#        Sol#
This is the time, this is the place
      Do#          Re#m   Fa#
So we look for the future
            Do#                  Re#m   Do#
But there's not much love to go around
        Sol#           Do#        Re#m     Fa# Do#
Tell me why this is a land of confusion?

I remember long ago when the sun was shining,
    Fam7/Do
the stars were bright all through the night,
        Re#           La#/Re    Dom
and the sound of your laughter
     Fa       Sol#             Si
as I held you tight, so long ago

Re#m                             Fa# Sol#
 I won't be coming home tonight
                                Do#
My generation will put it right
                      Si         Sol# Re#m
We're not just making promises

that we know we'll never keep

        Do#      Re#m          Sol#
There's too many men, too many people
       Fa#     Re#m      Fa#
