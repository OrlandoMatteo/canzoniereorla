Rem             La#      Lam7            Fa
 Well I've been waiting, waiting here so long
Rem           La#      Lam7             Do
 But thinking nothing, nothing could go wrong,
    Sol
ooh now I know
          La#            Fa
She has a built in ability
   La#                 Fa
To take everything she sees
La#                            La#/Do
 And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her

Fa4                Fa   La#/Fa        Do
 She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
Fa4            Fa    La#/Re      Do
 She reaches in, and grabs right hold of your heart

Well I don't really know her, I only know her name
Rem             La#
 But she crawls under your skin,
Lam7                    Fa        Sol
 you're never quite the same, and now I know
          La#                      Fa
She's got something you just can't trust
     La#             Fa    La#
It's something mysterious
                              La#/Do
And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her

Fa4                Fa   La#/Fa        Do

She don't like losing, to her it's still a game
Rem                  La#
 And though she will mess up your life,
Lam7                       Do       Sol
 You'll want her just the same, and now I know
          La#            Fa
