Si            La6
 The path is clear
          Mi/Sol#   Si/Fa#
Though no eyes can see
     Sol6           Fa#7sus4    Si7sus4
The course laid down long  before
Mi/Si          Fa#m7/Mi
 And so with gods and men
     Sim/Re        Do/Re
The sheep remain inside their pen,
       Sol                Mi/Sol#          La#dim  Si
Though many times they've seen the way to leave
            La6
He rides majestic
     Mi/Sol#   Si/Fa#
Past homes of men
    Sol6        Fa#7sus4     Si7sus4
Who care not or gaze with joy,
Mi/Si       Fa#m7/Mi
 To see reflected there
    Sim/Re              Do/Re
The trees, the sky, the lily fair,
    Sol               Mi/Sol#      La#dim
The scene of death is lying just below

    Mi        La6          Mimaj7      La
The mountains cuts off the town from view,
       La#m     Re#m      La#7     Re#
Like a cancer growth is removed by skill
       Re#/Fa Fa/Re# Sol
Let it be     re   vealed
La#6/Do          Dom7/Fa
A waterfall, his madrigal
   Mi6           Si
An inland sea, his symphony

 Mi6  Si  Do#m7/Fa#

Si       La6
 Undinal songs
         Mi/Sol# Si/Fa#
Urge the sailors on
     Sol6     La4 La  Re6   Mim7/La  Si  Mi6
Till lured by sirens' cry

   Mim  Lam  Mim  Lam  Mim  Sim  Lam  Si

   Mim  Lam  Mim  Lam  Mim  Fa7

   Dom7  Fa7  Dom7  Fa7

   Dom7  Fa7  Dom7  Fa7  Fa#7  Si
   ...

Si          La6   Mi/Sol#     Si/Fa#
 Now as the river dissolves in sea,
   Sol6        Fa#7sus4          Si7sus4  Mi/Si
So Neptune has claimed another soul
            Fa#m7/Mi
And so with gods and men
    Sim/Re         Do/Re
The sheep remain inside their pen,
  Sol              Mi/Sol#          La#dim  Si
Until the Shepherd leads his flock away
             La6      Mi/Sol# Si/Fa#
The sands of time were eroded  by
    Sol6     Fa#7sus4    Si7sus4
The river of constant change
