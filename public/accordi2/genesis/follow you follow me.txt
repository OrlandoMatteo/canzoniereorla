     Just one  single tear in each passing year

    Sol      Lam7        Sol         Lam7
     With the dark, oh I see so very clearly now
     Rem              Sol7              Do        Re7sus4     Re7
     All my fears are drifting by me so slowly now, fading away
   Sol     Lam7     Sol               Lam7
     I can say, the night is long but you are here
     Rem                      Sol7           Do
     Close at hand though I'm better for the smile you give,
   Re7sus4         Re7
     and while I live

          Sol              Do/Sol    Re/Sol

     Just one  single tear in each passing year
