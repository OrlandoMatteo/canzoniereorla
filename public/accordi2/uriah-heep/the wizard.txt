Do                      La# Fa   Do
 He was the wizard of a thousand kings
                                    La# Fa Do   La#
And I chanced to meet him one night wandering
           Fa/La       La#       Fa/La  Do
He told me tales and he drank my wine
                            La# Fa  Do
Me and my magic man kind of feeling fine

Do
 He had a cloak of gold
    La# Fa  Do
And eyes of fire
                         La# Fa Do    La#
And as he spoke I felt a deep desire
            Fa         La#        Lam   Do
To free the world of its fear and pain
                            La# Fa Do   La# Fa Do
And help the people to feel free again

Sol                                       Fa     Sol
 Why don't we listen to the voices in our hearts
                                               Fa   Sol
'Cause then I know we'd find we're not so far apart

Everybody's got to be happy
                Fa    Sol
Everyone should sing

For we know the joy of life
                        Fa
The peace that love can bring

Do                          La# Fa   Do
 So spoke the wizard in his mountain home
                                     La#   Fa  Do   La#
The vision of his wisdom means we'll never be alone
           Fa         La#    Lam    Do
And I will dream of my magic night
                                  La#      Fa         Do
And the million silver stars that guide me with their light

La# Fa Do    La# Fa Do
