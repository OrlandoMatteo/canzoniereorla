        Re  Do  Sol  Do

Sol                  Do
 Everybody saying we gotta take a chance
    Re                            Do
And telling me what the hell went wrong
Sol                    Do
 We only listen to the words that we sing
      Re                   Do
Now a million are singing along

(Last one)
Sol             Doadd9
 We got it right, you got wrong,
Re                   Do
 We’re still around (Last one to die)
Sol             Doadd9
 We’re going up, you’re going down
Re                   Do
 We’re still around (Last one to die)

Sol
 No rules in a
Do
Scandalous world
Re            Do
... a path to find
Sol        Do
 We sit on top of the world
          Re               Do
And we’re proving it every night

(Last one)
Sol             Doadd9
 We got it right, you got wrong,
Re                   Do
 We’re still around (Last one to die)
Sol            Doadd9
 We’re going up, you’re going down
Re                   Do
 We’re still around (Last one to die)

Sol                     Do
 Thru the storm and the gigs
                     Re
And the good and the bad
               Do
There ain't no doubt
Sol               Do
 We knew from the very first show,
Re               Do
what it was all about
