Sim           Sol                La           Sim
 I know there's something in the wake of your smile
      Sol               La           Sim
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yea
             Sol             La          Sim
You've built a love but that love falls apart
                           Sol         Mim
Your little piece of heaven  turns too dark

               Sim  Sol
Listen to your heart
          Re          La
When he's calling for you
               Sim  Sol
Listen to your heart
                Re           La
There's nothing else you can do
        Re                La
I don't know where you're going
    Sol          Re
And I don't know why,
                   Sim  Sol
But listen to your heart
   La                   Sim Soladd9  La Sim
Before you tell him goodbye

Sim Soladd9  La Sim

Sim        Sol                La            Sim
 Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
          Sol                La          Sim
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yea
           Sol                 La         Sim
They're swept away and nothing is what it seems,
                        Sol        Mim
The feeling of belonging  to your dreams

               Sim  Sol
Listen to your heart
          Re          La
When he's calling for you
               Sim  Sol
Listen to your heart
                Re           La
There's nothing else you can do
        Re                La
I don't know where you're going
    Sol          Re
And I don't know why,
                   Sim  Sol
But listen to your heart
   La                   Sim  Sol  La Sim
Before you tell him goodbye

 And there are voices

That want to be heard

 So much to mention

But you can't find the words

 The scent of magic,

The beauty that's been

 When love was wilder  than the wind
