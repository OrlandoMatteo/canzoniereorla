       Do   Fa

 Do                              Fa
(it must have been love but it's over now)

      Do
Lay a whisper on my pillow,
          Fa            Sol
Leave the winter on the ground
          Do                     Fa
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
       Rem              Sol
In the bedroom and all around
         Lam             Do             Fa    Sol
Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away

                   Do                 Fa
It must have been love but it's over now
                   Rem       Lam7        Sol
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
                   Do                 Fa
It must have been love but it's over now
                   Rem               Lam7         Sol
From the moment we touched, 'til the time had run out

       Do
Make-believing we're together
         Fa              Sol
That I'm sheltered by your heart
           Do                     Fa
But in and outside I've turned to water
       Rem             Sol
Like a teardrop in your palm
           Lam           Do           Fa    Sol
And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away

                   Do                 Fa
It must have been love but it's over now
                   Rem            Lam7     Sol
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
                   Do                 Solm7
It must have been love but it's over now,
                Do                         La#add9
It's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows

Rem  Do  La#add9  Rem

Fa  Do  La#add9  Rem

Yeah, it must have been love but it's over now
