What's the time?
           Sim7     Mi
Seems it's already morning
          Fa#m
I see the sky
        Re             Mi4  Mi
It's so beautiful and blue
         Fa#m
The TV's on
        Re         Mi                      Si  Sim
But the only thing showing is a picture of you
          Fa#m
Oh, I get up
    Sim7        Mi
And make myself some coffee
         Fa#m
I try to read a bit
        Re           Mi4  Mi
But the story's too thin
            Fa#m
I thank the Lord above
     Re                  Mi
That you're not there to see me
                  Si  Sim
in the shape I'm in

            Mi
Spending my time
             Si
Watching the days go by
           Do#m
Feeling so small
               La
I stare at the wall
             Fa#m La          Si
Hoping that you   think of me too
                Do#m  Do#m/Si
I'm spending my time

         Fa#m
I try to call
    Sim7                 Mi
But I don't know what to tell you
          Fa#m
I leave a kiss
   Re                 Mi4  Mi
On your answering machine
            Fa#m
Oh, help me please
       Re                Mi4  Mi
Is there someone who can make
                     Si     Sim
me wake up from this dream?

            Mi

Hoping that you are missing me too
                Mi
I'm spending my time
             Si
Watching the sun go down
                     Do#m
I fall asleep to the sound
               La
Of "tears of a clown"
          Fa#m       Si
A prayer gone blind
                Do#m  Do#m/Si
I'm spending my time

Fa#m        La
 My friends keep telling me,
      Mi           Re    Fa#m
"Hey, life will go on!"
     La                   Mi
Time will make sure I get over you
Fa#m         La               Mi
