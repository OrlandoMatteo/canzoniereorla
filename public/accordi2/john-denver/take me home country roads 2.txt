La             Fa#m           Mi
 Almost heaven, West Virginia,
                      Re         La
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
                   Fa#m
Life is old there, older than the trees,
Mi                          Re             La
younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze

        La             Mi
Country roads, take me home
       Fa#m      Re
to the place I belong
        La              Mi
West Virginia, mountain mamma,
        Re            La
take me home, country roads

La              Fa#m                 Mi
 All my memories   gather round her,
              Re               La
miner's lady, stranger to blue water
                Fa#m
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky,
Mi                        Re             La
misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

        La             Mi
Country roads, take me home
       Fa#m      Re
to the place I belong
        La              Mi
West Virginia, mountain mamma,
        Re            La
take me home, country roads

Fa#m        Mi           La
 I hear her voice in the morning hour,
                  Re      La             Mi
she calls me, the radio reminds me of my home far away
    Fa#m             Sol          Re
And driving down the road I get a feeling
       La                    Mi               Mi7
that I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

        La             Mi
Country roads, take me home
       Fa#m      Re
to the place I belong
        La              Mi
West Virginia, mountain mamma,
        Re            La
take me home, country roads

        La             Mi
Country roads, take me home
       Fa#m      Re
to the place I belong
        La              Mi
West Virginia, mountain mamma,
        Re            La
take me home, country roads
        Mi                La
Take me home now, country roads
        Mi                La
Take me home now, country roads
