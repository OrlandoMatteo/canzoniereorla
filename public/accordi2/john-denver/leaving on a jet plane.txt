       Sol                    Do
All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
    Sol                 Do
I'm standing here outside your door
  Sol                Do             Re
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
        Sol                     Do
But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn,
    Sol                    Do
The taxi's waiting, he's blowing his horn
  Sol                Do            Re
Already I'm so lonesome I could die


   Sol           Do
So kiss me and smile for me
Sol                   Do
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Sol                   Do             Re
Hold me like you'll never let me go
    Sol       Do
I'm leaving on a jet plane
Sol                  Do
   Don't know when I'll be back again
Sol     Do              Re
  Oh babe, I hate to go


           Sol               Do
There's so many times I've let you down
   Sol               Do
So many times I've played around
  Sol            Do                 Re
I tell you now they don't mean a thing
      Sol               Do
Every place I go I'll think of you
      Sol                Do
Every song I sing I'll sing for you
     Sol                Do                  Re
When I come back I'll bring your wedding ring


   Sol           Do
So kiss me and smile for me
Sol                   Do
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Sol                   Do             Re
Hold me like you'll never let me go
    Sol       Do

Sol                  Do
   Don't know when I'll be back again
Sol     Do              Re
  Oh babe, I hate to go


Sol                Do
Now the time has come to leave you
Sol             Do
One more time let me kiss you
     Sol               Do             Re
Then close your eyes I'll be on my way
Sol               Do
Dream about the days to come
     Sol               Do
When I won't have to leave alone
 Sol              Do               Re
About the times I won't have to say


   Sol           Do
So kiss me and smile for me
Sol                   Do
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Sol                   Do            Re
