  You fill up my senses    like a night in a forest
        La          Sol     Fa#m  Mim       Sol         La7
Like the mountains in springtime    like a walk in the rain
             Sol La    Sim      Sol        Re    Re/Do#  Sim
Like a storm in the desert    like a sleepy blue ocean

You fill up my senses     come fill me again

Come let me love you,    come love me again
