       Mi  Fa#m7 La La/Si   Mi  Fa#m7 La

La/Si  Mi                        Fa#m7 Re  Si
He was born in the summer of his 27th  year,
       Mi                         Fa#m7      La  La/Si
coming home to a place he'd never been before
   Mi                                   Fa#m7            Re  Si
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
          Mi                           Fa#m7  La Si
You might say he found a key for every door
        Mi
When he first came to the mountains,
    Fa#m7         Re  Si     Mi                    Fa#m7  La La/Si
his life was far away on the road and hanging by a song
        Mi                            Fa#m7          Re  Si
But the strings already broken and he doesn't really care
         Mi                                   Fa#m7  La Si
It keeps changing fast, and it don't last for long

        La       Si              Mi
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high,
     La              Si          Mi
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
    La               Si            Mi                 La
The shadows from the starlight are softer than a lullaby
               Mi        Fa#m7 La
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
      La/Si    Mi        Fa#m7 La Si

He climbed cathedral mountains,
       Fa#m7           Re  Si
he saw silver clouds below
       Mi                           Fa#m7  La La/Si
He saw everything as far as you can see
         Mi                                Fa#m7              Re  Si
And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun
       Mi                               Fa#m7  La La/Si
And he lost a friend, but kept the memory
       Mi                           Fa#m7          Re
Now he walks in quiet solitude, the forest and the streams,
Si      Mi                     Fa#m7  La La/Si
seeking grace in every step he takes
    Mi                                 Fa#m7        Re    Si
His sight is turned inside himself, to try and understand
      Mi                              Fa#m7  La La/Si
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake

        La       Si              Mi
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high,
     La              Si          Mi
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
La               Si            Mi        La
 talk to God and listen to the casual reply
               Mi        Fa#m7 La
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
      La/Si    Mi        Fa#m7 La Si

        Mi
Now his life is full of wonder,
        Fa#m7                  Re  Si
but his heart still knows some fear
     Mi                            Fa#m7  La Si
Of a simple thing he can not comprehend
         Mi                                Fa#m7             Re   Si
Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more
     Mi                          Fa#m7  La Si
More people, more scars upon the land

        La       Si              Mi
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high,
     La              Si          Mi
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
  La             Si             Mi                 La
I know he'd be a poor man if he never saw an eagle fly
               Mi
Rocky Mountain high
La       Si             Mi
Colorado Rocky Mountain high
     La              Si          Mi
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
La                 Si           Mi          La
Friends around the campfire and everybody's high
               Mi        Fa#m7 La
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
