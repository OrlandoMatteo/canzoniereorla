Mi5
 Another time another place
         Fa5         Sol5
A hollow universe in space
Mi5
 I took a trip to see the sights
          Fa5              Sol5
I will be blacker than the night

Do5             La#5 Do5
 One way ticket no returns
                    La#5    Do5
My shooting star so fast it burnt
                La#5     Do5
On the edge that you can see

Re5                   Do5     Re5
 Let's shoot the moon you and me
                Do5       Re5
I'm not particular you'll see
                Do5  Re5
Just a lonesome galaxy

Sol5            Sol4
 Shadows in the stars
              Fa5/Sol
We will not return
               Do5
Humanity won't save us
                Sol5
At the speed of light
               Sol4
Shadows in the stars
              Fa5/Sol
We will not return
               Do5
Humanity won't save us
                 Sol5  Do5/Sol  Sol5
We slip into the night

Sol5  Do5/Sol  Sol5

Mi5
 I'll say a mass for you and wave
         Fa5            Sol5
Shooting plasma from my grave
Mi5
 Event horizon lost in space
        Fa5        Sol5
Running in a human race

Do5                   La#5      Do5
 I don't know where I don't know why
                    La#5  Do5
But somehow back in time again
                     La#5    Do5
I'm on the edge that you can see

Re5            Do5     Re5
 I'm not particular at night
            Do5     Re5
A single particle of me
                      Do5    Re5
You won't be tracking me by sight

Sol5            Sol4
 Shadows in the stars
              Fa5/Sol
We will not return
               Do5
Humanity won't save us
                Sol5
At the speed of light
               Sol4
Shadows in the stars
              Fa5/Sol
We will not return
               Do5
Humanity won't save us

                 Lam    Sol   Lam   Rem  Sol
We slip into the night
