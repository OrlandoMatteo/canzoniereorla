         Mim                       Re
From the coast of gold, across the seven seas
    Mim            Re
I'm travellin' on, far and wide
    Do                       Mim
But now it seems, I'm just a stranger to myself
            Re
And all the things I sometimes do,
   Do                           Re
it isn't me but someone else

  Mim                Re
I close my eyes, and think of home
        Mim                 Re
Another city goes by in the night
         Do
Ain't it funny how it is,
          Mim
you never miss it 'til it's gone away
       Re
And my heart is lying there
             Do
and will be 'til my dying day

    Sol Do La    Re    Do La
    So     understand
          Mim                    Re
    Don't waste your time always searching
              Do
    for those wasted years
    Sol      Do La        Re     Do La
    Face up     make your stand
        Mim            Re            Do
    And realize you're living in the golden years

Mim                              Re
Too much time on my hands, I got you on my mind
      Mim                Re
Can't ease this pain, so easily
         Do
When you can't find the words to say
             Mim
it's hard to make it through another day
       Re                              Do
And it makes me wanna cry and throw my hands up to the sky
