       Sol#m  Fa# Do#    Sol#m  Fa# Do#

Sol#m   Fa#    Do#     Sol#m  Fa# Do#
Bury me softly in this womb
Sol#m       Fa#     Do#    Sol#m  Fa# Do#
I give this part of me for you
Sol#m               Fa#    Do#
Sand rains down and here I sit
Sol#m        Fa#
Holding rare flowers
Do#  Sol#m  Fa# Do#    Sol#m  Fa# Do#
In a tomb...        in bloom
Sol#m                Fa#           Do#      Sol#m  Fa# Do#
Down in a hole and I don't know if I can be saved
Sol#m          Fa#         Do#     Sol#m  Fa# Do#
See my heart I decorate it like a grave
        Sol#m                     Fa#           Do#         Sol#m  Fa# Do#
Oh, you don't understand who they thought I was supposed to be
Sol#m                Fa#           Do#         Sol#m  Fa# Do#
Look at me now I'm a man who won't let himself be

Do#m          Si Fa#
Down in a hole,
Do#m            Si Fa#
feeling so small
Do#m          Si Fa#
Down in a hole,
Do#m          Si Fa#
losing my soul
Do#m Re#5  Mi Si   Fa#7
I'd  like  to fly,
             Mi             Sol#m  Fa# Do#
But my wings have been so denied

Sol#m  Fa# Do#

Sol#m                      Fa#         Do#             Sol#m  Fa# Do#
Down in a hole and they've put all the stones in their place
     Sol#m               Fa#             Do#           Sol#m  Fa# Do#
I've eaten the sun so my tongue has been burned of the taste
Sol#m                 Fa#       Do#         Sol#m  Fa# Do#
I have been guilty of kicking myself in the teeth
Sol#m            Fa#       Do#         Sol#m  Fa# Do#
I will speak no more of my feelings beneath

Do#m          Si Fa#
Down in a hole,
Do#m            Si Fa#
feeling so small
Do#m          Si Fa#
Down in a hole,
Do#m          Si Fa#
losing my soul
Do#m Re#5  Mi Si   Fa#7
I'd  like  to fly,
             Mi             Sol#m  Fa# Do#
But my wings have been so denied

Sol#m  Fa# Do#

Sol#m   Fa#    Do#
Bury me softly in this womb
Sol#m        Fa#   Do#
Oh I want to be inside of you
Sol#m       Fa#     Do#
I give this part of me for you
Sol#m        Fa#   Do#
Oh I want to be inside of you
Sol#m               Fa#    Do#
Sand rains down and here I sit
Sol#m        Fa#    Do#    Sol#m  Fa# Do#
Holding rare flowers
Sol#m        Fa#   Do#
Oh I want to be inside of you

Do#m          Si Fa#
Down in a hole,
Do#m            Si Fa#
feeling so small
Do#m          Si Fa#
Down in a hole,
Do#m          Si Fa#
losing my soul
Do#m          Si Fa#
Down in a hole,
Do#m            Si Fa#
feeling so small
Do#m          Si Fa#
Down in a hole,
Do#m          Si Fa#
out of control
Do#m Re#5  Mi Si   Fa#7
I'd  like  to fly,
             Mi             Sol#m  Fa# Do#
But my wings have been so denied

Sol#m  Fa# Do#    Sol#m  Fa# Do#
