[<pre>La
The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
              Re             La 
I dreamed I held you in my arms
              Re              La     
But when I awoke dear, I was mistaken
               Mi         La 
And I hung my head and cried

La                                      
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
              Re                   La
You make me happy when skies are gray
              Re                      La 
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
                        Mi       La   
Please don't take my sunshine away

La
I'll always love you and make you happy
             Re             La   
If you could only say the same
             Re                  La
But if you leave me, to love another
                   Mi          La  
Well you'll regret it all someday


La                                      
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
              Re                   La
You make me happy when skies are gray
              Re                      La 
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
                        Mi       La   
Please don't take my sunshine away


La 
You told me once dear, that you really loved me
              Re               La
And no one else could come between
                  Re                 La 
Well now you've left me, and love another
                    Mi       La
You have shattered all my dreams


La
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
              Re                   La 
You make me happy when skies are gray
               Re                    La
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
                      Mi       La  
Please don't take my sunshine away
                      Mi       La  
Please don't take my sunshine away</pre>]
