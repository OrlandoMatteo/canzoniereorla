  Lam
Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
    Fa
And wouldn't you love to love her?
Lam
 Takes to the sky like a bird in flight
    Fa
And who will be her lover?
Do
 All your life you've never seen
   Fa                    Do
Woman taken by the wind

Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Fa
 Will you ever win?

Lam
 She is like a cat in the dark
     Fa
And then she is to darkness
Lam
 She rules her life like a fine skylark
     Fa
And when the sky is starless
Do
 All your life you've never seen
   Fa                    Do
Woman taken by the wind

Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
Fa
 Will you ever win?

Will you ever win?

Dreams unwind

Love's a state of mind
