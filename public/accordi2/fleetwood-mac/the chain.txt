Mim7                 La
Listen to the wind blow
           Re    Do  Mim
Watch the sun rise
               La
Run in the shadows

Damn your love
           Re   Do  Mim
Damn your lies

       Lam
And if you don't love me now

You will never love me again
      Mim            Do
I can still hear you saying
          Re
You would never break the chain
       Lam
And if you don't love me now

You will never love me again
      Mim            Do
I can still hear you saying
          Re                    Mim
You would never break the chain

Mim7                 La
 Listen to the wind blow
       Re            Do  Mim
Down comes the night
Mim7            La
 Run in the shadows

Damn your love
            Re  Do  Mim
Damn your lies
Mim7            La
 Break the silence

Damn the dark
           Re   Do  Mim
Damn the light

       Lam
And if you don't love me now

You will never love me again
      Mim            Do
I can still hear you saying
          Re
You would never break the chain
       Lam
And if you don't love me now

You will never love me again
      Mim            Do
I can still hear you saying
          Re
You would never break the chain
       Lam
And if you don't love me now

You will never love me again
      Mim            Do
I can still hear you saying
          Re                    Mim Do/Mi
You would never break the chain

Mim Do/Mi   Mim Do/Mi   Mim Do/Mi

Lam   Mim   Lam   Mim   Lam   Mim

Lam   Do Sol Mim    Lam   Do Sol Mim

Lam   Do Sol Mim    Lam   Do Sol Mim

Lam  Do Sol       Mim
Chain,  keep us together
Lam  Do Sol       Mim
Chain,  keep us together
Lam  Do Sol       Mim
Chain,  keep us together
Lam  Do Sol       Mim
Chain,  keep us together...
