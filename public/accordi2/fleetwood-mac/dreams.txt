Famaj7           Sol
 Now here you go again
       Famaj7             Sol    Famaj7
You say you want your freedom
              Sol            Famaj7   Sol
Well, who am I to keep you down?
Famaj7         Sol
 It's only right that you should
Famaj7              Sol
Play the way you feel it
    Famaj7          Sol         Famaj7
But listen carefully to the sound
        Sol
Of your loneliness
        Famaj7                  Sol
Like a heartbeat.. drives you mad
       Famaj7              Sol               Famaj7  Sol
In the stillness of remembering what you had
               Famaj7  Sol
And what you lost...
              Famaj7  Sol
And what you had...
              Famaj7  Sol
And what you lost

Famaj7         Sol               Famaj7    Sol
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Famaj7         Sol                   Famaj7    Sol
Players only love you when they're playing
       Famaj7               Sol                 Famaj7  Sol
Say... Women... they will come and they will go
Famaj7           Sol
When the rain washes you clean...
       Famaj7  Sol       Famaj7  Sol    Famaj7
you'll know,    you'll know

Lam  Sol    Famaj7

Famaj7         Sol           Famaj7         Sol
 Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions
Famaj7        Sol          Famaj7  Sol  Famaj7
 I keep my visions to myself
           Sol
It's only me
             Famaj7              Sol
Who wants to wrap around your dreams and...
Famaj7          Sol                  Famaj7
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
           Sol
Dreams of loneliness...
        Famaj7                  Sol
Like a heartbeat.. drives you mad
       Famaj7              Sol               Famaj7  Sol
In the stillness of remembering what you had
               Famaj7  Sol
And what you lost...
              Famaj7  Sol
And what you had...
              Famaj7  Sol
And what you lost
