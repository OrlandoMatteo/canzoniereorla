    Re5
Confusion in her eyes that says it all

She's lost control

And she's clinging to the nearest passer by

She's lost control

And she gave away the secrets of her past

And said "I've lost control again"

And of a voice that told her when and where to act

She said "I've lost control again"

        Sol5              La5            La#5
And she turned around and took me by the hand
    Do5                Re5
And said "I've lost control again"
             Sol5            La5         La#5
And how I'll never know just why or understand
    Do5                La5
She said "I've lost control again"
          Sol5       La5            La#5
And she screamed out kicking on her side
    Do5                Re5
And said "I've lost control again"
    Sol5             La5                    La#5
And seized up on the floor, I thought she'd died
    Do5                La
She said "I've lost control"
              Sol5  La5    La#5
She's lost control again
Do5             Re5
  She's lost control
              Sol5  La5   La#5
She's lost control again
Do5             La
  She's lost control

      Sol5             La5                La#5
And I had to phone her friend to state my case
    Do5                Re5
And say "She's lost control again"
        Sol5              La5          La#5
And she showed up all the errors and mistakes
    Do5                La
And said "I've lost control again"
          Sol5               La5            La#5
And she expressed herself in many different ways
  Do5             Re5
Until she lost control again
    Sol5            La5          La#5
And walked upon the edge of no escape
     Do5                  La5
And laughed "I've lost control"
              Sol5  La5   La#5
She's lost control again
Do5             Re
  She's lost control
              Sol5  La5  La#5

Do5             La5
  She's lost control

I could live a little better with the myths and the lies
         Do5                       Re5
When the darkness broke in, I just broke down and cried
        Sol5          La5        La#5
I could live a little in a wider line
         Do5       La5
When the change is gone,
Sol5      La5     La#5
When the urge is gone
   Do5     Re5
To lose control...
