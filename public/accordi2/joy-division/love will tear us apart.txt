When routine bites hard,
      Sim          La
And ambitions are low
      La7sus4
And resentment rides high,
     Sim           La
But emotions won't grow
      La7sus4
And we're changing our ways,
       Sim       La
Taking different roads

La7sus4 Re                 Sim   La
Love, love will tear us apart again
La7sus4 Re                 Sim   La
Love, love will tear us apart again

Why is the bedroom so cold?
        Sim         La
Turned away on your side
     La7sus4           Re
Is my timing that flawed?
      Sol/Si       La
Our respect run so dry?
        La7sus4              Re
Yet there's still this appeal,
           Sol/Si           La
That we've kept through our lives

La7sus4 Re                 Sim   La
Love, love will tear us apart again
La7sus4 Re                 Sim   La     La7sus4
Love, love will tear us apart again

Do you cry out in your sleep?
     Sim          La
All my failings exposed...
       La7sus4         Re
Gets a taste in my mouth
     Sol/Si          La
As desperation takes hold
      La7sus4            Re
Why is it something so good
     Sol/Si            La
Just can't function no more?

La7sus4 Re                 Sim   La
Love, love will tear us apart again
La7sus4 Re                 Sim   La
Love, love will tear us apart again
La7sus4 Re                 Sim   La
Love, love will tear us apart again
La7sus4 Re                 Sim   La
Love, love will tear us apart again
