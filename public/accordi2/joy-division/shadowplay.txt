       Do#   Fa

       Do#
To the centre of the city where
               Re#         Fa5
all roads meet waiting for you
       Do#
To the depths of the ocean where
               Re#           Fa5
all hopes sank searching for you
      Do#
I was moving through the silence
                  Re#      Fam
without motion waiting for you
     Do#
In a room with no window
       Re#/Do#        Fa
in the corner I found truth

Do#   Re# Fa     Do#   Re# Fa

       Do#
In the shadowplay, acting out your own death,
Re#        Fam
knowing no more
         Do#
As the assassins all grouped in four lines,
Re#            Fa
dancing on the floor
           Do#
Yeah, with cold steel,
                                       Re# Fam
odour on their bodies made a move to connect
Do#                        Re#/Do#
I could only stare in disbelief
                  Fa
as the crowds all left

Do#  Re#/Do#  Fam     Do#  Re#/Do#  Fa

      Do#              Re#     Fam
I did everything, everything I wanted to
         Do#           Re#       Fam
I let them use you for their own ends
       Do#
To the centre of the city at night,
Re#         Fa
waiting for you
       Do#
To the centre of the city at night,
Re#         Fa
waiting for you

Do#   Re# Fam    Do#   Re# Fam
