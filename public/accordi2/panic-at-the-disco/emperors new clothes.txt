Welcome to the end of eras

Ice has melted back to life

Done my time and served my sentence

Dress me up and watch me die
      Si
If it feels good, tastes good
   Sol#m
It must be mine
Re#m
Dynasty decapitated

You just might see a ghost tonight

(Double double double down, pushing it all in)
                               La#7
And if you don't know, now you know

                    Si
I'm taking back the crown
                       Sol#m
I'm all dressed up and naked
                      Re#m
I see what's mine and take it

(Finders keepers, losers weepers)

Oh oh, yeah
    Si
The crown...
               Sol#m
So close I can taste it
                      Re#m
I see what's mine and take it

(Finders keepers, losers weepers)

Oh oh, yeah

Re#m
Sycophants on velvet sofas

Lavish mansions, vintage wine

I am so much more than royal

Snatch your chain and mace your eyes
      Si
If it feels good, tastes good
   Sol#m
It must be mine
Re#m
Heroes always get remembered

But you know legends never die

(Double double double down, pushing it all in)
                               La#7
And if you don't know, now you know

                    Si
I'm taking back the crown

I'm all dressed up and naked

I see what's mine and take it

The crown...
               Sol#m
So close I can taste it
                      Re#m
I see what's mine and take it

(Finders keepers, losers weepers)

Oh oh, yeah
Re#m
Mortal kings are ruling castles

Welcome to my world of fun

Liars settle into sockets

Flip the switch and watch them run

Si           Sol#m
Oh oh, yeah, oh oh
 Re#m
(Finders keepers, losers weepers)

I'm taking back, back, taking back, back
    Si
The crown
                       Sol#m
I'm all dressed up and naked
                      Re#m
