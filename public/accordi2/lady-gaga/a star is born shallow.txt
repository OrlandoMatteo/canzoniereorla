   Are you happy in this modern world?
Mim7      Re/Fa#     Sol
   Or do you need more?
Do                                 Sol         Re
   Is there something else you’re searching for?

I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in
Sol           Re        Mim
I’ll never meet the ground
Lam                      Lam/Sol   Re/Fa#
Crash through the surface, where they can’t hurt us
      Sol            Re       Mim
We’re far from the shallow now
