Fa#
Everyday I love you less and less

It's clear to see that you've become obsessed
     Fa#m
I've got to get this message to the press
     Fa#
That everyday I love you less and less

And everyday I love you less and less

I've got to get this feeling off my chest
    Fa#m
The doctor says all I need's pills and rest
      Fa#
Since everyday

                                        Sol
  I love you less and less and less and less

  I know, I feel it in my bones

  I'm sick, I'm tired of staying in control
     Fa#
  Oh yes, I feel, my hands upon a wheel,

  I've got, to know that not too much is real
     Sol
  Oh yes, I'm stressed, I'm sorry I digressed

  Impressed, you dressed to SOS

         Fa#m  Mi              La
     And oooooh and my parents love me
     Si  Fa#m Mi                  La
     Oooooh     and my girlfriend loves me
     Si
     Oooooh

Fa#
Everyday I love you less and less

I can't believe once you and me did sex
   Fa#m
It makes me sick to think of you undressed
      Fa#
Since everyday I love you less and less

And everyday I love you less and less

You're turning into something I detest
    Fa#m
And everybody says that you're a mess
      Fa#
Since everyday

                                        Sol
  I love you less and less and less and less

  I know, I feel it in my bones

  I'm sick, I'm tired of staying in control
     Fa#
  Oh yes, I feel, my hands upon a wheel,

  I've got, to know that not too much is real
     Sol
  Oh yes, I'm stressed, I'm sorry I digressed

  Impressed, you dressed to SOS
