Mistreated, misplaced, missundaztood
                       Mim7
Miss "no way it's all good"
                   Doadd9 
It didn't slow me down
Sol
Mistaken
                    Re4
Always second guessing
            Mim7
Underestimated

When you talk about yourself

                     Re4
Look happy you'll make it
                       Mim7
Filled with so much hatred

Such a tired game

The whole world's scare so I swallow the fear
Re4
The only thing I should be drinking is an ice cold beer
Mim7
So cool in line and we try, try, try
Doadd9
But we try too hard, it's a waste of my time
Sol
Done looking for critics, cuz they're everywhere
Re4
They don't like me jeans, they don't get my hair
Mim7
Exchange ourselves and we do it all the time
Doadd9
Why do we do that?
