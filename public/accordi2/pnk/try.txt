Lam            Fa               Do      Sol
Ever wonder about what he's doing
Lam          Fa             Do      Sol
How it all turned to lies
Lam             Fa             Do      Sol
Sometimes I think that it's better

There is gonna be a flame

Where there is a flame
                      Lam
Someone's bound to get burned
                    Fa
But just because it burns

Funny how the heart can be deceiving
Lam               Fa           Do      Sol
More than just a couple times
Lam          Fa               Do      Sol
Why do we fall in love so easy
Lam               Fa        Do      Sol
Even when it's not right
