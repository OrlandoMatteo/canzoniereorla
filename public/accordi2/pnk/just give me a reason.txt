[<pre>Sol
  Right from the start
             Do                 Mim
You were a thief, you stole my heart
    Do                 Sol
And I your willing victim
  Sol                                Do                      Mim
I let you see the parts of me that weren't all that pretty
         Do                      Sol
And with every touch you fixed them



    Mim             Re    La/Do#    Re      Re4
Now you've been talking in your sleep, oh oh
Mim           Re   La/Do#   Re   Re4
Things you never say to me, oh oh
Mim           Re      La/Do# Re
Tell me that you've had enough
Sol      Do     Sol/Si Re4  Re
Of our love, our love



Sol                             Re/Fa#
Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough
       Mim                             Sim
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
           Re4             Sol
And we can learn to love again
                             Re/Fa#                         Mim
It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts
                       Sim
We're not broken, just bent
           Re4             Sol
And we can learn to love again



    Sol                               Do                     Mim
I'm sorry, I don't understand where all of this is coming from
  Do                     Sol
I thought that we were fine

(Oh, we had everything)
     Sol                              Do                  Mim
Your head is running wild again, my dear we still have everything
    Do                 Sol
And it's all in your mind

(Yeah, but this is happening)



Mim            Re    La/Do#     Re       Re4
You've been having real bad dreams, oh oh
    Mim          Re  La/Do#     Re   Re4
You used to lie so close to me, oh oh
        Mim           Re    La/Do#  Re
There's nothing more than empty sheets
  Sol         Do     Sol/Si Lam           Do     Sol/Si Re4  Re
Between our love, our love, oh our love, our love



Sol                             Re/Fa#
Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough
       Mim                             Sim
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
           Re4             Sol
And we can learn to love again
                              Re/Fa#                        Mim
I never stopped, you're still written in the scars on my heart
                        Sim
You're not broken, just bent
           Re4           Mim
And we can learn to love again



(Mim)                Sim
Oh, tear ducts and rust
                 Do
I'll fix it for us
                  Re                      Mim
We're collecting dust but our love's enough
                   Sim                    Do
You're holding it in, you're pouring a drink
                  Lam7    Re4 Re
No, nothing is as bad as it    seems
N.C.
We'll come clean



N.C.
Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
