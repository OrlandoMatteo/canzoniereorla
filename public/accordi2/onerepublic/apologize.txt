[<pre>        Lam
I'm holding on your rope,
        Fa               Do       Sol
Got me ten feet off the ground
        Lam                         Fa                 Do         Sol
And I'm hearing what you say but I just can't make a sound
       Lam
You tell me that you need me
Fa                       Do          Sol
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
Lam
You tell me that you're sorry
Fa                       Do           Sol
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say...


          Lam                Fa         Do       Sol
That it's too late to apologize, it's too late
            Lam                Fa         Do       Sol
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

Lam   Fa   Do   Sol


Lam                              Fa
I'd take another chance, take a fall
                Do       Sol
Take a shot for you
      Lam                            Fa
And I need you like a heart needs a beat
                 Do           Sol
But it's nothing new - yeah yeah

  Lam                      Fa
I loved you with the fire red-
                Do               Sol
Now it's turning blue, and you say...
Lam                      Fa                      Do
"Sorry" like the angel heaven let me think was you
    Sol
But I'm afraid...


     Lam                Fa         Do       Sol
It's too late to apologize, it's too late
            Lam                Fa         Do       Sol
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late


      Lam   Fa   Do   Sol
Whoaa ohhh...
Lam   Fa   Do   Sol


     Lam                Fa         Do       Sol
It's too late to apologize, it's too late
            Lam                Fa         Do       Sol
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late
            Lam                Fa     Do     Sol
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah-
            Lam                Fa     Do     Sol
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah-


    Lam                           Fa                   Do
I'm holding on your rope, got me ten feet... off the ground...</pre>]
