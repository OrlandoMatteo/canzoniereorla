   Do                                    
This town is colder now, I think it's sick of us
   Mim
It's time to make our move, I'm shakin' off the rust
  Do
I've got my heart set on anywhere but here
   Mim                                    Lam   
I'm staring down myself, counting up the years
                              Fa
Steady hands, just take the wheel
                          Lam
And every glance is killing me
                       Fa
Time to make one last appeal for the life I lead


  Do
Stop and stare
                         Sol
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
                     Lam
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
                        Fa        Fa    Sol
But I've become what I can't be, oh

 Do
Stop and stare
                                 Sol
You start to wonder why you're 'here' not 'there'
                           Lam
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
                              Fa
But fair ain't what you really need
Fa                       Do
Oh, can you see what I see?


   Do   
They're tryin' to come back, all my senses push
   Mim
Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could
  Lam 
Steady feet, don't fail me now
Fa
Gonna run till you can't walk
  Lam 
Something pulls my focus out
                  Fa
And I'm standing down


 Do
Stop and stare
                         Sol
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
                  Lam
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
                        Fa        Fa  
But I've become what I can't be, oh
 Do
Stop and stare
                                 Sol
You start to wonder why you're 'here' not 'there'
                            Lam
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
                         Fa
But fair ain't what you really need
Sol             Do
Oh, you don't need
    Mim       Lam        Fa
    Oh       Oh        Oooooo
                Sol
What you need, what you need, what you need


Do
Stop and stare
                        Sol
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
                       Lam
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
                        Fa        Sol
But I've become what I can't be, oh
                     Do
Oh, do you see what I see?</pre>]
