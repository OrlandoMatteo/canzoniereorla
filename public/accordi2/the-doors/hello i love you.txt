     La  Sol  Do  Re

   La    Sol                Do           La
Hello, I love you won't you tell me your name?
   La    Sol             Do           La
Hello, I love you let me jump in your game
   La    Sol                Do           La
Hello, I love you won't you tell me your name?
   La    Sol             Do           La
Hello, I love you let me jump in your game

      La      Sol      Do    La
She's walking down the stree..t,
La       Sol   Do      La
blind to every eye she meets
       La           Sol    Do  La
Do you think you'll be the gu..y,
   La       Sol          Do     La
to make the queen of the angels sigh?

   La    Sol                Do           La
Hello, I love you won't you tell me your name?
   La    Sol             Do           La
Hello, I love you let me jump in your game
   La    Sol                Do           La
Hello, I love you won't you tell me your name?
   La    Sol             Do           La
Hello, I love you let me jump in your game

    La        Sol     Do  La
She holds her head so hi..gh,
       La     Sol    Do  La
like a statue in the sk..y
    La       Sol             Do       La
Her arms are wicked, and her legs are long
         La       Sol           Do       La
When she moves my brain screams out this song....

La#      Sol#      Do#    La#
Sidewalk crouches at her feet,
       La#      Sol#      Do#       La#
like a dog that begs for something sweet
       La#     Sol#      Do#      La#
Do you hope to make her see, you fool?
       La#     Sol#        Do#   La#
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?

   La# Sol#    Do# La#
Hello..... Hello.....
   La# Sol#    Do# La#
Hello..... Hello.....
   La# Sol#    Do# La#
Hello..... Hello.....
   La# Sol#    Do# La#
Hello..... Hello.....
