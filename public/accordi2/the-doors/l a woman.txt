Well, I just got into town about an hour ago

Took a look around, see which way the wind blow

Where the little girls in their Hollywood bungalows

Are you a lucky little lady in the City of Light

Or just another lost angel?
        Sol            La
City of Night, City of Night
        Sol            La
City of Night, City of Night, woo, c'mon

La
L.A. woman, L.A. woman

L.A. woman, Sunday afternoon

L.A. woman, Sunday afternoon

L.A. woman, Sunday afternoon

Drive through your suburbs
          Sol              La
Into your blues, into your blues, yeah
          Sol
Into your blue-blue blues
          La
Into your blues, oh, yeah

  La       Sol     La Sol  La Sol La Sol
I see your hair is burnin'
La        Sol         La Sol  La Sol La Sol
Hills are filled with fire
        La    Sol   La    Sol  La Sol La Sol
If they say I never loved you
    La        Sol   La Sol  La Sol La Sol
You know they are a liar
La      Sol       La  Sol La Sol La Sol
Drivin' down your freeway
La       Sol La Sol La Sol La Sol
Midnight alleys roam

La
Cops in cars

The topless bars
                      Sol       La
Never saw a woman so alone, so alone
    Sol       La
So alone, so alone

Motel, money, murder, madness

Let's change the mood from glad to sadness
