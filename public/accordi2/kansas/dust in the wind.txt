  Do     Sol/Si  Lam
I close my   eyes
Sol          Rem7
only for a moment
        Lam           Sol/Si
and the moment's gone
Do   Sol/Si  Lam
all my   dreams
Sol              Rem7        Lam
pass before my eyes a curiosity
Re/Fa# Sol           Lam  Lam/Sol
     dust in the wind
Re/Fa#          Sol           Lam   Sol/Si
all we are is dust in the wind

Do    Sol/Si   Lam
Same old   song
Sol              Rem7
just a drop of water
       Lam          Sol/Si
in the endless sea
Do   Sol/Si  Lam
all we   do
Sol               Rem7
crumbles to the ground
            Lam         
though we refuse to see
Re/Fa# Sol           Lam    Lam/Sol
     dust in the wind
Re/Fa#          Sol           Lam   Sol  Rem7
all we are is dust in the wind

Sol/Si   Do     Sol/Si  Lam
Now,  don't hang on
Sol               Rem7
nothing last forever
        Lam            Sol/Si
but the earth and sky
   Do     Sol/Si Lam
it slips a   way
    Sol    
And all your money
Rem7           Lam
won't another minute buy
Re/Fa# Sol           Lam    Lam/Sol
     dust in the wind
Re/Fa#          Sol           Lam   Lam/Sol  
all we are is dust in the wind
Re/Fa# Sol           Lam    Lam/Sol
     dust in the wind
Re/Fa#          Sol           Lam
everything is dust in the wind
