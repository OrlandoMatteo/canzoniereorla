            Sol
Like a small boat
On the ocean
             Sol
Sending big waves
Into motion
                   Mim
Like how a single word
                  Doadd9
Can make a heart open
                   Sol
I might only have one match
but I can make an explosion


               Sol/Si           Doadd9
And all those things I didn't say
          Re               Mim7
Wrecking balls inside my brain
          Sol/Si               Doadd9
I will scream them loud tonight
         Re
Can you hear my voice this time


             Sol
This is my fight song
              Re
Take back my life song
             Mim7       Doadd9
Prove I'm alright song
            Sol
My power's turned on
                        Re
Starting right now I'll be strong
               Mim7
I'll play my fight song
      Doadd9                               Mim     Re
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
      N.C.                                  Sol
Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me


 Mim7
Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep
Doadd9
Everybody's worried about me
Sol
In too deep
        Re
Say I'm in too deep
Mim7
And it's been two years
I miss my home
               Doadd9
But there's a fire burning in my bones
       Sol
And I still believe
        Re
Yeah I still believe
