    Re               Remaj7
And now, the end is near,
         Re7            Si7
And so I face the final curtain,
    Mim7                Mim7/Re 
My friend. I'll say it clear,
             Mim7/Do#   La7       Re
I'll state my case of which I'm certain.
     Re                   Re7
I've lived a life that's full.
            Sol             Solm
I traveled each and every highway,
    Re                    La       La4   Sol    Re
And more, much more than this, I did it m      y way.


    Re               Remaj7
Regrets, I've had a few,
         Re7                Si7
But then again, too few to mention.
  Mim7               Mim7/Re
I did what I had to do,
           Mim7/Do#   La7    Re
And saw it thru without exemption.
  Re                    Re7
I planned each charted course,
             Sol              Solm
Each careful step along the byway,
    Re                    La     La4    Sol        Re
And more, much more than this, I did it m      y way.


               Re                   Re7
Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew,
           Sol                     Sol4 Sol
When I bit off more than I could chew,
            Mim               La7
But thru it all, when there was doubt,
         Fa#m               Sim7
I ate it up, and spit it out.
           Mim               La
I faced it all, and I stood tall,
   La4    Sol       Re
And did it m      y way.


    Re               Remaj7
I've loved, I've laughed and cried.
         Re7                Si7
I've had my fill; my share of losing.
  Mim7               Mim7/Re
And now, as tears subside,
           Mim7/Do#   La7    Re
I find it all so  amusing.
  Re                    Re7
To think I did all that;
             Sol              Solm
And may I say - not in a shy way,
    Re   La       La4        Sol    Re
"No, oh no not me, I did it m   y way".

               Re               Re7
For what is a man, what has he got?
              Sol          
If not himself, then he has naught.
         Mim7               La7
To say the things he truly feels;  
           Fa#m                Sim7 
And not the words of one who kneels.
           Mim7               La         La4    Sol      Re
The record shows I took the blows - And did it m   y way!</pre>]
