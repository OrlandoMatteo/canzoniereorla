I've got you  under my skin
     Re#m11  Sol#7        Do#maj7
I've got you  deep in the heart of me,

I've tried so    not to give in
  Fa#m6    Fa#/La#          Sol#7      Do#maj7
I said to myself, This affair never can go so well
     Dom7b5              Fa7                 Midim    La#m
But why should I try to resist, when Darling I know so well

For the sake of having you near,
                Re#m7              Fa#6/Sol#
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
       Fam7        Sidim       Sol#7
That repeats and repeats in my ear,
           La#m            Fa#6   Sol#7  Do#
"Don't you know, little fool,  you never can win?
Midim     Re#m7   Fa#/La#    Sol#7  Do#    Do#7add6
Use your mentality      wake up to reality
         Fa#                Fa#m
But each time I do, just the thought of you
         Do#6            Sol#m7  La#7
Makes me stop before I begin
            Re#m7  Sol#7b9      Do#maj7    Do#6
