        Sol  Mim7  Lam7  Re7

       Sol
That's life (that's life),
             Si7                Mim
that's what all the people say
                           La7
You're ridin' high in April, shot down in May
      Sol/Re         Si7         Mim
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
       La9                           Re7
When I'm back on top, back on top in June
                  Sol
I said that's life (that's life),
     Si7                    Mim
and as funny as it may seem
                           La7
Some people get their kicks stompin' on a dream
Sol/Re              Si7            Mim
 But I don't let it, let it get me down
            La9           Do6/Re               Sol
'cause this fine old world, it keeps spinnin' around

            Sol7
I've been a puppet, a pauper,

a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king
          Do
I've been up and down and over

and out and I know one thing
     La7
Each time I find myself flat on my face
  Re                                  Re7
I pick myself up and get back in the race

Sol
That's life (that's life),
          Si7               Mim
I tell you I can't deny it

I thought of quitting, baby,
La7
 but my heart just ain't gonna buy it
    Sol/Re                 Si7              Mim
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try
         La9               Do6/Re         Sol
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly

            Sol7
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate,

a poet, a pawn and a king
          Do
I've been up and down and over

and out and I know one thing
     La7
Each time I find myself layin' flat on my face
       Re                     Re#7
I just pick myself up and get back in the race

       Sol#
That's life (that's life),
           Do7                  Fam
that's life and I can't deny it
                                  La#7
Many times I thought of cuttin' out

but my heart won't buy it
    Sol#/Re#                    Do7             Fam  La#7
But if there's nothin' shakin' come this here July
                         Do#6/Re#            Sol#  Fa#7 Mi
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball a-and die
Re#7  Sol#
My,   my!
