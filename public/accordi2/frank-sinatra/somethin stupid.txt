        Fa#m7 Si7 Fa#m7 Si7 Mi

  Mi
I know I stand in line

Until you think you have the time
            Fa#m7        Si7  Fa#m7 Si7
To spend an evening with me
    Fa#m7         Si7
And if we go some place to dance
  Fa#m7               Si7
I know that there’s a chance
             Mi
You won’t be leaving with me
    Mi7
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
           La            Do7
And have a drink or two
    Fa#m7         Si7
And then I go and spoil it all
   Fa#m7            Si7
By saying something stupid
         Mi
Like: “I love you”
      Mi7
I can see it in your eyes

That you despise the same old lies
              La
You heard the night before
    Fa#7
And though it’s just a line to you

For me it’s true
                   Si7
It never seemed so right before

  Mi
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say
            Fa#m7        Si7  Fa#m7  Si7
To make the meaning come true
    Fa#m7             Si7
But then I think I’ll wait
          Fa#m7        Si7
Until the evening gets late
         Mi
And I’m alone with you
    Mi7
The time is right, your perfume fills my head

The stars get red
            La               Do7
And oh, the night’s so blue
    Fa#m7         Si7
And then I go and spoil it all
   Fa#m7            Si7
By saying something stupid
         Mi
Like: “I love you”

Mi   Fa#m7 Si7 Fa#m7 Si7     Mi

    Mi7
The time is right, your perfume fills my head

The stars get red
            La               Do7
And oh, the night’s so blue
    Fa#m7         Si7
And then I go and spoil it all
   Fa#m7            Si7
By saying something stupid
         Mi         Do7
Like: “I love you”
  Mi         Do7
I love you
  Mi         Do7
I love you...
