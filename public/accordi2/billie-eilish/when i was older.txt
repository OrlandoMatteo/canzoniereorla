   When I was older, I was a sailor, on an open sea
Lam                   Mi7                    Famaj7  
   But now I'm underwater, and my skin is paler, 
                   Mi7
than it should ever be
     Lam
Mmm-hmmm



Lam                 Mi7
   I'm on my back again
                                         
Dreaming of a time and place where you and
Famaj7
I remain the best of friends
                       Mi7
Even after all this ends, can we pretend?

Lam                            Mi7
   I'm on my, I'm on my back again
                                           
It's seeming more and more like all we ever 
  Famaj7
do is see how far it bends
                                Mi7
Before it breaks in half and then, we bend it back again



Lam
Guess I got caught in the middle of it
                                               Mi7
Yes I've been taught, got a little of it in my blood, 
in my blood
Famaj7
Memories burn like a forest fire
                                     Mi7
Heavy rain turns any funeral pyre to mud, in the flood

   I'm watching movies back to back in black and white, I never

   Seen anybody do it like I do it any better
Mi7
   Then going over you, I'm overdue for no endeavors

   Nobody lonely like I'm lonely and I don't know whether
Famaj7
   You'd really like it in the limelight

   You'd sympathize with all the bad guys
Mi7
   I'm still a victim in my own right

   But I'm the villain in my own eyes, yeah
