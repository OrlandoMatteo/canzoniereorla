Somethin' in the...

                 Lam
Somethin' in the air right now
                          Sol
Like I'm losin' track of time (Time, time)
                    Famaj7
Like I don't really care right now
            Mi7
But maybe that's fine
                  Lam
You weren't even there that day
                 Sol
I was waitin on you (You, you)
                Famaj7
I wonder if you aware away that day
              Mi7
Was the last straw for me

          Lam            Sol
And I know I sent you flowers (Know, know)
             Famaj7
Did you evere?
             Mi7
You ran the shower
                      Lam
And left them by the stairs
        Sol               Famaj7
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy, uhh
Mi7                                                   Lam
 Thought you had your shit together, but damn I was wrong

Lam                            Sol
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (Cause, cause)
                                   Famaj7
And this ain't nothin' like it once was (Was, was)
                                   Mi7
I know you think you're such an outlaw
               Lam
But you got no job (Job)
                              Sol
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (Cause, cause)

I know you think you're such an outlaw
               
But you got no job

             Lam
 I used to think you wer–µ shy (shy)
Sol
Or maybe you just had nothing on your mind
Famaj7                             Mi7
Maybe you were thinkin' 'bout yourself all the time (time)
   Lam
I used to wish you were mine (mine)
     Sol
But that was way before I realized
Famaj7                                Mi7
Someone like you would always be so easy to find
 Lam                    Sol      
(Um, um, so) So easy (easy, so, easy) 
Famaj7             Mi7   
Easy, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Lam             Sol
 Gave me no flowers
              Famaj7
Wish I didn't care
                     Mi7
You'd been gone for hours
             Lam    Sol
Could be anywhere (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Famaj7          Mi7
I thought you would've grown eventually
                   Lam
But you proved me wrong

Lam                             Sol

 What did I tell you?
              Famaj7
Don't get complacent
                     Mi7
It's time to face it now
