[<pre>Do Mim Re Lam


Do      Mim
Lights out
           Re            Lam
You're not here holding me
Do Mim
I count
      Re            Lam
Every tear down my cheek
           Do
Instead of sheep

Mim   Re    Lam
Ooh, ooh, ooh


Do    Mim
Sleep walk
     Re              Lam
Find myself on your street
Do     Mim
Three knocks
         Re           Lam
Ring the bell then I leave



Do Mim      Re                                 Lam
I tried a little black and white but I'm so blue
Do   Mim      Re                           Lam
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
                     Do
But that's still not true

Mim Re Lam


Do    Mim
Cold days
Lam     Re           Lam
Frozen lake in the park
Do   Mim
Old ways
        Re              Lam
Make mistakes when I'm lost

Now we go

Do    Mim   Re     Lam
Ooh, ooh, ooh


Do   Mim
Bad dreams
          Re    Lam
Might not mean anything
    Do   Mim
But you seem
       Re    Lam
Not to need anything


Do Mim      Re                                 Lam
I tried a little black and white but I'm so blue
Do   Mim      Re                           Lam
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
                     Do
But that's still not true

Do Mim


Lam
I'm still so blue
           Do               Mim
True blue, true blue, hey
      Re    Lam
True blue


Do Mim      Re                                 Lam
I tried a little black and white but I'm so blue

Do   Mim              Re                   Lam
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
Lam                   Do
But that's still not true


Mim               Re         Lam
And I'm still so blue
Do                    Mim
True blue, true blue, hey
     Re      Lam
True blue</pre>]
