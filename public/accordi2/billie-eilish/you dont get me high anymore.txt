I don't like stayin' at home
                          Rem   Dom
When the moon is bleeding red
                          Rem
Woke up stoned in the backseat
        Solm                                  Fa   Solm
From a dream where my teeth fell out of my head
Solm                     Fa    Re#
Cut it up, cut it up, yeah
                          Rem    Dom
Everybody's on something here
                     Rem
My godsend chemical best friend
  Solm
Skeleton whispering in my ear
 

 Re#                Solm
Walk with me to the end
 Fa                      Dom
Stare with me into the abyss
Re#                      Solm
Do you feel like letting go?
Fa                        Dom
I wonder how far down it is

Nothing is fun
Dom        La#    Rem Solm
Not like before
Solm                            Solm Fa La
You don't get me high anymore
Re#              Re# Rem
Used to take one
Dom            La# Rem Solm
Now it takes four
N.C.
You don't get me high anymore
 

 Solm                        Fa
Runnin' through emergency rooms
  Re#                        Rem   Dom
Spinning wheels and ceiling fans
                     Rem
My handshake, cellophane, landscape
   Solm                                Fa  Solm
Mannequin fakin' it the best that I can
  Solm                Fa   Re#
Cadillac, Cadillac red
Re#                       Rem
No hands on the steering wheel
Dom                           Rem
I'm crashing this save-a-ho puppet show
Solm                        Fa
UFO obliterate the way I feel
