[<pre>Lam      Sol     Fa       Sol
Help, I lost myself again
   Lam    Sol      Fa
But I remember you
Lam         Sol        Fa         Sol
Don't come back, it won't end well
      Lam         Sol       Fa
But I wish you'd tell me to


            Lam        Sol
Our love is six feet under
        Fa        Sol
I can't help but wonder
       Lam        Sol              Rem
If our grave was watered by the rain
            Fa   Lam
Would roses bloom?
            Fa   Lam
Could roses bloom
Fa
Again?


Lam         Sol
Retrace my lips
Fa          Sol
Erase your touch
Lam           Sol        Fa
It's all too much for me
Lam   Sol
Blow away
     Fa        Sol
Like smoke in air
      Lam        Sol       Fa
How can you die carelessly?


            Lam       Sol
Our love is six feet under
        Fa        Sol
I can't help but wonder
       Lam        Sol              Rem
If our grave was watered by the rain
            Fa   Lam
Would roses bloom?
            Fa   Lam
Could roses bloom?


        Fa
They're playing our sound
Sol              Lam
Laying us down tonight
    Fa
And all of these clouds
Sol                 Lam
Crying us back to life
                Fa
But you're cold as a knife


Lam       Sol
Six feet under
        Fa        Sol
I can't help but wonder
       Lam        Sol              Mim
If our grave was watered by the rain
Fa  Lam
Bloom
Fa  Lam
Bloom
Fa
Again


Lam      Sol    Fa      Sol
Help, I lost myself again
    Lam  Sol      Fa
But I remember you</pre>]
