[<pre>     Rem               Do
Our time is up your eyes are shut, I wont
        Solm               La#            Do
Get to tell you what, I needed you to know


      Rem               Do
It's dark enough, the moonlight doesn't show
    Solm                  La#              Do
And all my love, could never bring you home


                 La#                        Solm
There's no more stars to find, and I'm too far behind
         Rem                       Do
And I'd love to let you go, I'd love to let you go
              La#                      Solm
You're always on my mind, I called a thousand times
       Rem                        Do                     
And I have to let you go. But I love you more and more,
                La#
than you could know


  Rem            Do
I sat alone, awaited your reply
     Solm               La#            Do
Was driven home, when I started to cry
   Rem                  Do
I should've known, I should've said goodbye
   Solm            La#                Do
I only hoped, I would've had more time


                 La#                        Solm
There's no more stars to find, and I'm too far behind
         Rem                      Do
And I'd love to let you go, I'd love to let you go
              La#                       Solm
You're always on my mind, I called a thousand times
       Rem                        Do                     
And I have to let you go. But I love you more and more,
                 La#
than you could know


                La#                         Solm
We're both too young, to live and die this way
               Rem                        Do
A sunny summer day, with so much left to say
           La#                         Solm
Not twenty one, the eighteenth out to pay
                      Rem                      Do   
The day you couldn't stay, you made me wanna pray,
                   La#
but I think God's fake


                 La#                        Solm
There's no more stars to find, and I'm too far behind
        Rem                      Do
And I'd love to let you go, I'd love to let you go
              La#                          Solm
You're always on my mind, when I called a thousand times
      Rem                        Do                       
And I have to let you go. But I love you more and more
            La#
and more and more and more and more and more,
Solm                                      Rem   
more and more and more than you'll ever know. 
               Do
You will never know. You will never know.</pre>]
