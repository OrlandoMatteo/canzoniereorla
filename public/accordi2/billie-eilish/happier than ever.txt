When I'm away from you
                 Mi7
I'm happier than ever
                         Lam
Wish I could explain it better
                 Rem7    Sol
I wish it wasn't true, mmm
 
         Doadd9
Give me a day or two
                       Mi7
To think of something clever
                 Lam
To write myself a letter
                  Rem7  Sol
To tell me what to do,  mm-mm
 
 
Do
  Do you read my interviews?
   Mi7
Or do you skip my avenue?
     Lam
When you said you were passin' through
      Rem7b5
Was I even on your way?
   Do
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
    Mi7
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
      Lam
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
       Rem7b5
And I'd end up more afraid
               Mi7
Don't say it isn't fair
                                   Lam                 Re
You clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable, ooh
           Rem7          Sol7
So if you really wanna know
 
         Doadd9
When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
                  Mi7
I'm happier than ever (I'm happier than ever)
                         Lam
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
                 Rem7    Sol
I wish it wasn't true, mmm

Do              Mi7                   Lam
You called me again, drunk in your Benz
               Fa          Fam
Drivin' home under the influence
Do                 Mi7                       Lam
You scared me to death but I'm wastin' my breath
                  Fa             Fam
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
Do                    Mi7
I don't relate to you
Lam                     Fa
I don't relate to you, no
                  Do               Mi7
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
            Lam            Fa
You made me hate this city
 
                  Do                      Mi7
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
            Lam              Fa
Never told anyone anything bad
                     Do                        Mi7
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
                 Lam                       Fa
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
   Do                             Mi7
So don't waste the time I don't have
    Lam                         Fa
And don't try to make me feel bad
                    Do                         Mi7
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
                 Lam                          Fa
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
               Do                     Mi7
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
              Lam                          Fa
Shut them all out for you 'cause I was a kid
 
Do                      Mi7
You ruined everything good
        Lam                     Fa
Always said you were misunderstood
Do                        Mi7
Made all my moments your own
Lam                     Fa
Just fuckin' leave me alone
