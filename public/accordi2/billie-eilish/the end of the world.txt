[<pre>Rem  Lam  La#  Do Lam


Rem                    Lam
Breathe the air again
Lam                    La#
It's a beautiful day
La#
I wish this moment would stay
Do
With the earth
     Lam     Rem
Some primal paradise
Rem                     Lam
But there you go again
Lam                      La#
Saying everything ends
                             Do
Saying you can't depend on anything
La7
Or anyone


Rem                Fa         La#
If the end of the world was near
Fa                Do        Rem
Where would you choose to be?
             La#   Fa    Do
If there was five more minutes
    La
Of air
           La#
Would you panic and hide?
   Fa
Or run for your life?
   Do                              La#
Or stand here and spend it with me?
          Fa    Do    Rem
If we had five more minutes
La#       Do                Rem
Would I, could I make you happy?


Rem                       Lam
And we would live again
Lam                       La#
In the simplest of ways
La#
Living day after day
Do          Lam     Rem
Like some primal animals
Rem                  Lam
We would love again
Lam                  La#
Under glorious suns
                            Do
With the freedom that comes with the truth

Rem                Fa         La#
If the end of the world was near
Fa                Do        Rem
Where would you choose to be?
             La#   Fa    Do
If there was five more minutes
    La
Of air
           La#
Would you panic and hide?
   Fa
Or run for your life?
   Do                              La#
Or stand here and spend it with me?
          Fa    Do    Rem
If we had five more minutes
La#       Do                Rem
Would I, could I make you happy?

 
Rem                    Lam
So it finally came to pass
Lam                         La#
I saw the end of the world
La#
Saw the madness unfold
Do         Lam     Rem
Like some primal burial
                       Lam
And I looked back upon
     La#
Armageddon
                                Lam      La#
And the moment of truth between you and me

  
Lam La# Lam La#
Oh...

                     
          N.C.      Rem
If we had five more minutes
   La#     Do
Of air to breathe
       Fa     Do   Rem
And we cried all through it
        La#             Do
But you spend them with me
       Fa    Do   Rem
On our last few drags
   La#     Do
Of air we agree
La#         Do        Rem
I was, and you were, happy</pre>]
