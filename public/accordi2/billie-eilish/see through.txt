[<pre>Do              Domaj7
 Wait a minute, let me finish
        Rem                          Sol
 I know you don't care, but can you listen?
Do                 Domaj7
 I came committed, guess I overdid it
          Rem                             Sol
 Wore my heart out on a chain around my neck

 And now it's missing


   Do                    Domaj7
So I think I better go
                            Rem
I never really know how to please you
                              Sol
You're looking at me like I'm see-through
Do                     Domaj7
I guess I'm gonna go
                           Rem
I just never know how you feel
             Sol
Do you even feel anything?


Do Domaj7 Rem Sol


Do
You said, "Don't treat me badly"
Domaj7                           Rem
But you said it so sadly, so I did the best I could
                 Sol
Not thinking you would have left me gladly
Do                       Domaj7
I know you're not sorry, why should you be?
               Rem                        Sol
'Cause who am I to be in love when your love never is for me?


Do Domaj7 Rem Sol


Do
So I think I better go
Domaj7                       Rem
I never really know how to please you
                               Sol
You're looking at me like I'm see-through</pre>]
