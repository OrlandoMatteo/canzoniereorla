Sol           Do
What day is it?
Sol/Fa#       Sol/Si
And in what month
     Mim          Re         Do
This clock never seemed so alive.
Sol            Do
I can't keep up
   Sol/Fa#         Sol/Si
And I can't back down
           Mim   Re
I've been losing 
        Do
So much time.


            Sol       Lam
Cause' it's you and me,
    Do
And all other people
     Mim          Sol
With nothing to do,
Mim          Re
Nothing to lose,

Cause' it's you and me,
    Do
And all other people,

What other things 
    Sol/Fa#     Sol/Si
That I wanna say
Mim          Re          Do
Just aren't coming out right.
    Sol            Do
I'm tripping on words,
      Sol/Fa#         Sol/Si
You've got my head spinning
  Mim               Re          Do
I don't know where to go from here.


            Sol       Lam

    Do
And all other people

And it's you and me,
   Do
And all other people,
    Mim            Sol

Something about you now,
Sol       Re            Mim
I can't quite figure out,
Lam                     Re
Everything she does is beautiful,
Sim                     Dom   Dom/Re   Dom/Eb  Dom/Fa
Everything she does is right.
