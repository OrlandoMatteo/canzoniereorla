       Mi                                            Sol#
On the road again, just can't get wait to get on the road again
        Fa#m7
I find love is makin' music with my friends
    La                  Si            Mi
And I can't wait to get on the road again
                                          Sol#
On the road again, going places that I've never been
                         Fa#m7
Seein' things that I may never see again
    La                  Si           Mi
And I can't wait to get on the road again
       La
On the road again, like a band of gypsies
        Mi
we go down the highway
   La
We're the best of friends, insisting that the world keep turnin'
Mi           Si
our way, and our way

       Mi
On the road again, just can't get wait to get
       Sol#
on the road again
                      Fa#m7
I find love is makin' music with my friends
    La                   Si
And I can't wait to get on the road again

Mi  Sol#  Fa#m7  La Si Mi

Mi  Sol#  Fa#m7  La Si Mi

       La
On the road again, like a band of gypsies
        Mi
we go down the highway
   La
We're the best of friends, insisting that the world keep turnin'
Mi           Si
our way, and our way

       Mi                                            Sol#
On the road again, just can't get wait to get on the road again
                      Fa#m7
I find love is makin' music with my friends
    La                  Si            Mi
And I can't wait to get on the road again
    La
And I can't wait to get
Si            Mi    La  Si  Mi
on the road again
