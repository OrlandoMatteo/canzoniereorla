Re#             La#/Re    Dom
 Maybe I didn't love you
         Re#/La#        Sol#    La# Re#
Quite as often as I could have
                   La#/Re     Dom
And maybe I didn't treat you
         Re#/La#   Lam7b5      Sol#
Quite as good as I should have
                  Re#           Sol#
If I made you feel second best
         Re#/Sol     Fam   Re#/La#  La#
Girl I'm sorry I was blind
         Dom7   La#7/Re Re#   Fam7 Re#/Sol
You were always on  my  mind
Sol#       La#7         Re#    Sol# La#
 You were always on my mind

Re#                 La#       Dom
 And maybe I didn't hold you
          Re#/La#        Sol#   La# Re#
All those lonely, lonely times
                La#      Dom
I guess I never told you
    Re#/La#              Lam7b5  Fa9  Sol#
I'm so happy that you're mine
                            Re#           Sol#
Little things I should have said and done
      Re#/Sol         Fam   Re# Dom La#
I just never took the time
             Dom7   La#/Re Re#   Fam7 Re#/Sol Sol#
But you were always on  my mind
         La#7       Re#     Sol# La#
You were always on my mind

Re# La#/Re Dom Re#/La#
Tell       me
Sol#               Re#/Sol           Fam7  La#7sus4 La#7
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
    Re# La#/Re Dom Re#/La#
And give       me
        Sol#
Give me one more chance
Re#/Sol         Fam7   La#
To keep you satisfied
              Re#        La#  Dom  Re#/La#  Sol#  La#7
