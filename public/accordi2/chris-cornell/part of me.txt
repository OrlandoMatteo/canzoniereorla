 Little girl, I love when she talks to me

Got to smile when she walks that walk with me

I want the girl but I want a lot

Might cross my mind, but that's where it stops

 Fa#m                  Do#m
Oh, that bitch ain't a part of me
Sol#7                  Do#m
No, that bitch ain't a part of me
       Fa#m                   Do#m

No, that bitch ain't a part of, part of, part of me

Do#m
 I love the girl, I'm loving the dress she wears

She's got a hold, got a hold of my neck, oh yeah

I wanna cry, the way that she moves

I want the girl but not what she's going through

 Fa#m                  Do#m
Oh, that bitch ain't a part of me
Sol#7                  Do#m

No, that bitch ain't a part of, part of, part of me

Do#m
She was so friendly, I had one too many

But now that they tell she was rubbing up against me
      Sol#7  Sol#/Fa#      Do#m/Mi Do#m          Sol#7
But I swear, never meant a thing, she was just a fling
                                         Do#m
There's no other woman who does it like you
