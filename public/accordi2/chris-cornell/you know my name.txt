 If you take a life do you know what you'll give?
                    Re            Sim
Odds are, you won't like what it is
                                           Solm
When the storm arrives, would you be seen with me?
                  Re         Fa#
By the merciless eyes of deceit?

Sol        Fa#              Sim La   Sol#m7b5  Sol
 I've seen angels fall from blinding heights
            Fa#              Sim La Sol#m7b5
But you yourself are nothing so   divine
             Fa#
Just next in line

Sim                  Sol                   Mi
Arm yourself because no-one else here will save you
                Sim     Sol
The odds will betray you
             Miadd9
And I will replace you
    Sim            Sol                   Mi
You can't deny the prize it may never fulfill you
          Solmaj7
It longs to kill you
                   Mi
Are you willing to die?
            Mim
The coldest blood runs through my veins
           Sim   Sol Mi
You know my name

Sim                                      Solm
 If you come inside things will not be the same
           Re          Sim
When you return to the night

And if you think you've won
                Solm
You never saw me change
              Re          Fa#
The game that we all been playing

Sol        Fa#                  Sim La Sol#m7b5
 I've seen diamonds cut through harder men
Sol           Fa#
 Than you yourself
           Sim  La Sol#m7b5
But if you must pretend
                  Fa#
You may meet your end

Sim                  Sol                   Mi

You can't deny the prize it may never fulfill you
          Solmaj7
It longs to kill you
                   Mi
Are you willing to die?
            Mim
The coldest blood runs through my veins

Sol
Try to hide your hand
   Mi7
Forget how to feel (Forget how to feel)
Sol                      Mi7
Life is gone with just a spin of the wheel (Spin of the wheel)
