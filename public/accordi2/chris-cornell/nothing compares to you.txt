Do                           Sol/Si
  It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Lam                              Do  Sol
  since you took your love away
Do                        Sol/Si
  I go out all night and sleep all day
Lam7                             Do  Sol
  since you took your love away
Do                                     Sol/Si
  since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
Lam7                          Do  Sol
  I can see whoever I choose
Do                                Sol/Si  
  I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant 
       Lam7
but nothing
Lam                Mi
Nothing can take away these blues

       La#         Fa
'cause nothing compares
La#          Fa     Sol
  nothing compares to you

  It's been so lonely without you here
Lam7                         Do  Sol
  like a bird without a song
Do                               Sol/Si
  Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
      Lam7                    Fa   Fa4
tell me baby, where did I go wrong?

Do                                  Sol/Si
  I could put my arms around every girl I see
Lam7                               Do  Sol
  but they'd only remind me of you
Do                                  Sol/Si
  Went to the doctor guess what he told me 
guess what he told me
        Lam7
he said boy you better try to have fun
          Mi
no matter what you do,

but he's a fool


       La#         Fa
'cause nothing compares
Lam           Sol
  nothing compares to you

Do                                      Sol/Si
  All the flowers that you planted momma in the 
backyard
Lam7                          Do  Sol
  all died when you went away
Do                            Sol/Si
  I know that living with me baby was sometimes 
hard
Lam7                                  Mi
  but I'm willing to give it another try
