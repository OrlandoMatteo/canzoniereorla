Lam  Sol  Mim7  Fa

     Lam       Sol
On a cobweb afternoon
     Mim7          Fa
In a room full of emptiness
     Lam      Sol
By a freeway I confess
   Mim7            Fa
I was lost in the pages
Lam        Sol
Of a book full of death
Mim7            Fa
Reading how we die alone
Lam                      Sol
And if we're good we'll lay to rest
Mim7            Fa
   Anywhere we wanna go


Lam       Do     Sol     Lam Lasus2
  In your house I long to be
Lam      Do    Sol      Lam
Room by room patiently
     Fa            Lam
I'll wait for you there
Sol      Lam         Fa            Lam
Like a stone I'll wait for you there
 Mi  Mi7
Alone


Lam  Sol  Mim7  Fa


      Lam       Sol
On my deathbed I will pray
   Mim7              Fa
To the gods and the angels
       Lam     Sol
To the pagans or anyone
    Mim7             Fa
Who will take me to heaven
Lam         Sol
To a place I recall
Mim7            Fa
I was there so long ago
    Lam
The sky was bruised
    Sol
The wine was bled
    Mim7              Fa
And there you led me on


Lam      Do     Sol      Lam Lasus2
  In your house I long to be
Lam      Do    Sol     Lam
Room by room patiently
     Fa            Lam
I'll wait for you there
Sol        Lam      Fa           Lam
Like a stone I'll wait for you there
 Mi  Mi7    Mi  Mi7 
Alone    Alone


    Fa    Do
And on I read
Mi7                  Fa
  Until the day was gone
      Fam        Re7
And I sat in regret
    Mi7                  Lam
For all the things I've done
Fa                   Do
  For all that I've blessed
    Mi7            Fa
And all that I've wronged
   Fam              Re7
In dreams until my death
       Mi       Mi7
I will wander on


Lam       Do     Sol       Lam Lasus2
  In your house I long to be
Lam      Do    Sol      Lam
Room by room patiently
     Fa            Lam
I'll wait for you there
Sol       Lam        Fa            Lam
 Like a stone I'll wait for you there
 Mi  Mi7    Mi  Mi7   Fa
Alone    Alone</pre>]
