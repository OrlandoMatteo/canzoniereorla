And I heard, as it were,

the noise of thunder:

one of the four beasts saying:

"Come and see"

And I saw And behold, a white horse

Do

          Do
There's a man goin' 'round takin' names

And he decides who to free and who to blame

Everybody won't be treated all the same
                                     Lam   Fa
There'll be a golden ladder reaching down
         Sol        Do
When the man comes around

    Do
The hairs on your arm will stand up

At the terror in each sip and in each sup

Will you partake of that last offered cup
                               Lam    Fa
Or disappear into the potter's ground
         Sol        Do
When the man comes around?

Do
Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers

One hundred million angels singin'
                               Fa  Do/Mi  Sol
Multitudes are marching to the big kettle drum
Sol7
Voices callin', voices cryin'

Some are born and some are dyin'
                               Do
It's Alpha and Omega's Kingdom come
        Fa                  Do
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree

    Do
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
    Fa                  Do
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree

It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

'Til Armageddon, no Shalam, no Shalom

Then the father hen will call his chickens home

The wise men will bow down before the throne
                                          Lam     Fa
And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns
         Sol        Do
When the man comes around

   Do
Whoever is unjust, let him be unjust still

Whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still

Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still
                                 Lam   Fa
Listen to the words long-written down,
         Sol        Do
When the man comes around

Do
Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers

One hundred million angels singin'
                               Fa  Do/Mi  Sol
Multitudes are marchin' to the big kettle drum
Sol7
Voices callin', voices cryin'

Some are born and some are dyin'
                               Do
It's Alpha and Omega's Kingdom come
        Fa                  Do
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree

The virgins are all trimming their wicks
    Fa                  Do
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree

     Do
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
                                    Lam    Fa
In measured hundredweight and penny pound
         Sol        Do
When the man comes around


And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts,

and I looked and behold: a pale horse

And his name, that sat on him, was Death

And Hell followed with him
