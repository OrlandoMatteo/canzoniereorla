I remember when I was a Lad
           La#          Fa
Times were Hard and things were Bad

But there's a Silver Linin' Behind Every Cloud
          Fa                      Fa7
Just poor People that's all we Were
           La#                     Fa
Try'n' to make a Livin' outta blackland Dirt
Fa                                   Do7    Fa

Mama would call in all of us
                                        Do7
You could hear us singing for a country mile
           Fa                    Fa7
Now little brother has done gone on
            La#           Fa
