   La#m                            Do#
An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day;
 La#m                        Do#
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
     La#m
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
Fa#                                 La#m
Plowin' through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw.

      La#m                                Do#
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel,
      La#m                                 Do#
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel;
  La#m
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
   Fa#                                                La#m
He saw the riders comin' hard and heard their mournful cry.

            Do#            La#m
Yip-pie-ya-aye, yip-pie-yi-o,
Fa#                La#m
ghost riders in the sky.
            Do#            La#m
Yip-pie-ya-aye, yip-pie-yi-o,
Fa#                La#m
ghost riders in the sky.

       La#m                       Do#
As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name;
        La#m                                Do#
"If you want to save your soul from hell a' ridin' on our range,
     La#m
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride,
Fa#                              La#m
Tryin' to catch the Devil's herd across these endless skies."

            Do#            La#m
Yip-pie-ya-aye, yip-pie-yi-o,
Fa#                La#m
ghost riders in the sky.
            Do#            La#m
Yip-pie-ya-aye, yip-pie-yi-o,
Fa#                La#m
ghost riders in the sky.

     La#m
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred,
      Do#
Their shirts all soaked with sweat;
     La#m                                Do#
Heâ€™s ridin' hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet;
        La#m
They've got to ride forever in that range up in the sky,
   Fa#                                              La#m
On horses snortin' fire, as they ride on, hear their cry.

            Do#            La#m
Yip-pie-ya-aye, yip-pie-yi-o,
Fa#                La#m
ghost riders in the sky.
            Do#            La#m
Yip-pie-ya-aye, yip-pie-yi-o,
Fa#                La#m
ghost riders in the sky.
