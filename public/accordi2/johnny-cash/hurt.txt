Lam   Do       Re     Lam       Do      Re       Lam
   I hurt myself today   to see if I still feel
  Do    Re        Lam        Do      Re          Lam
I focus on the pain   the only thing that's real
    Do      Re       Lam         Do      Re       Lam
The needle tears a hole   the old familiar sting
       Do      Re      Lam           Do      Re      Sol          
Try to kill it all away   but I remember everything


Lam              Fa     Do               Sol
What have I become?     My sweetest friend
Lam          Fa             Do        Sol
Everyone I know  goes away in the end
    Lam                 Fa    Sol               Sol
And you could have it all   My empire of dirt
Lam              Fa      Sol                Lam
I will let you down    I will make you hurt

Lam   Do         Re        Lam        Do      Re       Lam
   I wear this crown of thorns   upon my liar's chair
Do       Re        Lam       Do     Re    Lam
Full of broken thoughts   I cannot repair
  Do          Re        Lam         Do       Re       Lam
Beneath the stains of time   the feelings disappear
Do         Re      Lam    Do     Re           Sol
You are someone else   I am still right here


Lam              Fa     Do               Sol
What have I become?     My sweetest friend
Lam          Fa             Do        Sol
Everyone I know  goes away in the end
    Lam                 Fa    Sol            Sol
And you could have it all   My empire of dirt
Lam              Fa     Sol               Sol
I will let you down   I will make you hurt
   Lam               Fa     Sol              Sol
If I could start again  a million miles away
Lam              Fa    Sol
I would keep myself  I would find a way</pre>]
