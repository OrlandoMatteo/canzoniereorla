I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
          Si7                     Mi
I keep my eyes wide open all the time.
           La                         Mi
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
               Si7               Mi
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
          Mi7                         La
I find myself alone when each day is through
            Re                  La
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
               Mi7               La 
Because you're mine, I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light

I keep you on my mind both day and night
          Sol                               Re
And happiness I've known proves that it's right

You've got a way to keep me on your side
            Mi7                        La
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
           Re                            La 
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
               Mi7               La
Because you're mine, I walk the line
