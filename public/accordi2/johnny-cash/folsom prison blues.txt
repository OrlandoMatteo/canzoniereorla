[<pre>Mi             
I hear the train a-coming, it's rolling round the bend
                                    Mi7        
and I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
    La                                              Mi    
I'm stuck at Folsom Prison, and time keeps draggin' on
         Si7                                    Mi
But that train keeps a-rollin' on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby, my Mama told me 'Son,
                             Mi7
always be a good boy; don't ever play with guns.'
      La                                       Mi
But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die
       Si7                                           Mi
when I hear that whistle blowin' I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dining car
                                      Mi7
They're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars
      La                                       Mi
But I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
       Si7                                       Mi
But those people keep a moving, and that's what tortures me


Mi | Mi7 | Mi | Mi7
La | La | Mi | Mi
Si7| Si7| Mi |

Well, if they freed me from this prison, 
if that railroad train was mine
                                       Mi7
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
      La                                       Mi
Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay
       Si7                                           Mi
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away</pre>]
