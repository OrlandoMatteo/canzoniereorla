 Mi                           Mi7
 I got a friend named Whiskey Sam
           La
 He was my boonierat buddy for a year in Nam
    Si7
 He said is my country just a little off track
          Mi                   Si7        Mi
 Took 'em twenty-five years to welcome me back
                                           Mi7
 But, it's better than not coming back at all
 La
 Many a good man I saw fall
 Si7
 And even now, every time I dream
            Mi                         Si7    Mi
 I hear the men and the monkeys in the jungle scream

      Mi
Drive on, it don't mean nothin'
   Si7                         Mi
My children love me , but they don't understand
    La                Mi
And I got a woman who knows her man
                              Si7   Mi
Drive on, don't mean nothin', drive on

     Mi                  Mi7
 I remember one night, Tex and me
La
 Rappelled in on a hot L.Z.
    Si7
 We had our 16's on rock and roll
           Mi                   Si7        Mi
 But, with all that fire, I was scared and cold

 We were crazy, we were wild
La
 And I have seen the tiger smile
   Si7
 I spit in a bamboo viper's face
     Mi                   Si7   Mi
 And I'd be dead , but by God's grace

      Mi
Drive on, it don't mean nothin'
   Si7                         Mi
My children love me , but they don't understand
    La                Mi
And I got a woman who knows her man
                              Si7   Mi
Drive on, don't mean nothin', drive on

Mi                                      Mi7
 It was a real slow walk in a real sad rain
     La
 And nobody tried to be John Wayne
 Si7
 I came home, but Tex did not
     Mi                     Si7    Mi
 And I can't talk about the hit he got
                                Mi7
 I got a little limp now when I walk
 La
 Got a little tremolo when I talk
        Si7
 But my letter read from Whiskey Sam
          Mi                           Si7 Mi
 You're a walkin' talkin' miracle from Vietnam

      Mi
Drive on, it don't mean nothin'
   Si7                         Mi
My children love me , but they don't understand
    La                Mi
And I got a woman who knows her man
                              Si7    Mi
Drive on, don't mean nothin',  drive on
