It doesn't hurt me

You want to feel how it feels?

You want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me?

You want to hear about the deal I'm making?
Sol#   Re#  Fam
   You

(If I only could, be running up that hill)
Sol#       Re#  Fam
  You and me

(If I only could, be running up that hill)
    Sol#
And if I only could
       La#
Make a deal with God
    Dom
And get him to swap our places
                    Sol#maj7
Be running up that road
                    La#
Be running up that hill
                    Dom
Be running up that building
           Sol#maj7  La#   Dom
If I only could, ooh


You don't want to hurt me

But see how deep the bullet lies

Unaware that I'm tearing you asunder

And there's a thunder in our hearts, baby

There's so much hate for the ones we love

Tell me we both matter, don't we?
Sol#  Re#  Fam
   You

(If I only could, be running up that hill)
Sol#       Re#  Fam
  You and me

(If I only could, be running up that hill)
Sol#       Re# Fam
  You and me,    won't be unhappy

(If I only could, be running up that hill)
    Sol#
And if I only could
       La#
Make a deal with God
    Dom
And get him to swap our places
                    Sol#maj7
Be running up that road
                    La#
Be running up that hill
                    Dom
Be running up that building
           Sol#maj7  La#   Dom
If I only could, ooh

Sol#  La#  Dom

Sol#
 C'mon, baby
La#                    Dom
C'mon, c'mon, darling

Let me steal this moment from you now
Sol#
 C'mon, angel
La#                    Dom
C'mon, c'mon, darling
                             Sol#  La#  Dom
Let's exchange the experience, ooh

    Sol#
And if I only could
       La#
Make a deal with God
    Dom
And get him to swap our places
                    Sol#maj7
Be running up that road
                    La#
Be running up that hill
        Dom
With no problems
               Sol#maj7
And if I only could
                  La#
Make a deal with God
                 Dom
And get him to swap our places
                    Sol#maj7
Be running up that road
                    La#
Be running up that hill
        Dom
With no problems

If I only could

Be running up that hill...
