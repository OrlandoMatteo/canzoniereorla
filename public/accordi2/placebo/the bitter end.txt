 Since we're feeling so anaesthetised
Simaj7   Si6     Re#m
In our comfort zone
                         Siadd9  Si
Reminds me of the second time
Simaj7    Si6          Re#m
 That I followed you home
                         Siadd9  Si  Simaj7
We're running out of alibis
         Si6       Re#m
From the second of May
                         Siadd9  Si
Reminds me of the summer time
Simaj7    Si6      Re#m  Siadd9  Si
On this winter's day
Simaj7           Si6    Re#m  Siadd9  Si
See you at the bitter end
Simaj7              Do#  Re#m
See you at the bitter end

                                 Siadd9  Si
Every step we take that's synchronized
Simaj7  Si6     Re#m
Every broken bone
                          Siadd9  Si  Simaj7
Reminds me of the second time
       Si6          Re#m
That I followed you home
                        Siadd9  Si  Simaj7
You shower me with lullabies
          Si6       Re#m
As you're walking away
                             Siadd9  Si
Reminds me that it's killing time
Simaj7    Si6     Re#m    Re#m7 Siadd9  Si
On this fateful day

Simaj7           Si6     Re#m   Re#m7 Siadd9  Si
See you at the bitter end
Simaj7           Si6     Re#m   Re#m7 Siadd9  Si
See you at the bitter end
Simaj7           Si6     Re#m   Re#m7 Siadd9  Si
See you at the bitter end
Simaj7           Si6     Re#m

Re#m
From the time we intercepted

Feels a lot like suicide
Si
Slow and sad, grown inside us

Arouse and see you're mine

(See you at the bitter end)
Re#m
Love has seen your run-around

Who wanna seek you now?
  Si
I want a peace

I'd whine out

(See you at the bitter end)
Re#m
Love's reached his side

Grab this gentleness inside
Si
Heard a cry

Six feet down

In six weeks' time

The mess you left

Will end
                        Re#m
See you at the bitter end
