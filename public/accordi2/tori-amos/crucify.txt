Sol#5                La#5
 Every finger in the room
   Fa#5        Sol#5
Is pointing at me
                      La#5
I wanna spit in their faces
Fa#5
 Then I get afraid of what that could bring
        Sol#5              La#5
I got a bowling ball in my stomach
        Fa#5         Sol#5
I got a desert in my mouth
                La#5
Figures that my courage would choose to
Fa#5
 sell out now

Mi        Si            Fa#             Sol#m  Mi
I've been looking for a savior in these dirty streets
Fa#           Sol#m       Mi             Fa#
Looking for a savior beneath these dirty sheets
          Si            Fa#
I've been raising up my hands
              Sol#m
Drive another nail in
          Do#/Fa
Just what God needs
         Mi
One more victim
       Sol#m
Why do we
Do#m7      Fa#
Crucify ourselves
Do#m   Sol#m
Every day
  Do#m7      Fa#
I crucify myself
Do#m7           Sol#m
Nothing I do is good enough for you
Do#m7     Fa#
Crucify myself
Do#m   Sol#m
Every day
  Do#m7     Fa#
I crucify myself
   Do#m7
My heart is sick of being, I said,
   Mi

Sol#5             La#5
 Got a kick for a dog
Fa#5         Sol#5
Beggin' for love
                  La#5
I gotta have my suffering
      Fa#5
So that I can have my cross
        Sol#5       La#5
I know a cat named Easter
       Fa#5              Sol#5
He says, "Will you ever learn?
                      La#5
You're just an empty cage, girl,
      Fa#5
If you kill the bird"

Mi     Sol#m
