Re#m      La#m
 Snow can wait
     Si     Sol#7sus4
I forgot my mittens
Re#m     La#m
 Wipe my nose
       Si         Sol#add9
Get my new boots on
Re#m            La#m
 I get a little warm in my heart
       Si       Sol#7sus4
When I think of winter
Re#m      La#m       Si       Sol#add9
 I put my hand in my father's glove
Re#m   La#m
 I run off
          Si         Sol#7sus4
Where the drifts get deeper
Re#m      La#m   Si              Sol#add9
 Sleeping beauty trips me with a frown
Re#m      La#m
 I hear a voice,
          Si       Sol#7sus4  Re#m     La#m
"You must learn to stand up for yourself
               Si         Sol#add9
'Cause I can't always be around"

Re#m      La#m
 Boys get discovered
Si    Sol#7sus4
As winter melts
Re#m     La#m      Si      Sol#add9
 Flowers competing for the sun
Re#m    La#m        Si
 Skating around the truth
    Sol#7sus4  Re#m
Who I am
      La#m           Si              Sol#add9
But I know, dad, the ice is getting thin

Re#m     Si
 Hair is grey
        Fa#      Sol#add9
And the fires are burning
Re#m     Si     Fa#    Sol#add9
 So many dreams on the shelf
Re#m     Si       Fa#
 You say I wanted you
   Sol#add9
To be proud of me
Re#m  Si         Fa#   Sol#add9
