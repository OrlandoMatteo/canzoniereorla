      La#
I was born by the river in a little tent
  Dom7                                       Solm
Oh, and just like the river I've been running   ever since
            La#          Dom7     Re#  Re7  Solm
It's been a long, a long time coming
                                  La#
But I know a change gon' come, oh yes it will
                                                 Dom7
It's been too hard living, but I'm afraid to die
                                   Solm
'Cause I don't know what's up there    beyond the sky
            La#          Dom7
It's been a long, a long time coming
      Re# Re7 Solm                    La#
But I know     a change gon' come, oh yes it will

  La#                                Dom7
I go to the movie and I go down town
                          Solm
Somebody keep telling me don't hang around
            La#          Dom7
It's been a long, a long time coming
      Re# Re7 Solm                      La#
But I know       a change gon' come, oh yes it will

Dom7           Solm        Dom7
  Then I go to my brother
                             Solm     Dom7
And I say, "Brother, help me please"
               Solm         Do9
But he winds up knockin' me
                Fa7
Back down on my knees

           La#
There been times that I thought
                          Dom7
I couldn't last for long
                           Solm
But now I think I'm able to carry on
            La#          Dom7
It's been a long, a long time coming
      Re# Re7 Solm
But I know      a change gon' come,
   La#
oh yes it will
