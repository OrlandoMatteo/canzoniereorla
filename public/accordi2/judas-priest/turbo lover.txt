Mim
You won't hear me, But you'll feel me
Re/Mi            Do/Mi      La5 Sol   Mim
Without warning, somethings daw-ning, listen

Then within your senses,

You'll know you're defenseless
Re/Mi                 Do/Mi    La5 Sol Mim
How your heart beats, when you run for cover
Re/Mi             Do/Mi         Mim
Your cant retreat I spy like no other

Re   Mim              Re Mim
Then we race together We can ride forever
Re/Mi                  Do/Mi   La5 Sol Mim
Wrapped in horsepower, driving in--to  fury
Re/Mi         Do/Mi              Si
Changing gear I pull you tighter to me

Mim                   Sol Re
I'm your turbo lover
Do      La5     Sol Mim
Tell me there's no  other
                      Sol Re
I'm your turbo lover
       La5 Sol Mim
Better run for cover

   Mim                           Do/Mi
We hold each other closer, as we shift to overdrive
    Lam                              Mim
And eveyrthing goes rushing by, with every nerve alive
                                         Do/Mi
We move so fast it seems as though we've taken to the sky
Lam                          Mim              Si
Love machines in harmony, we hear the engines cry

Mim                  Sol Re
I'm your turbo lover
Do      La5     Sol Mim
Tell me there's no  other
                     Sol Re
I'm your turbo lover
       La5 Sol Mim
Better run for cover

Mim    Do    La   Re Mim     Re

Mim    Do    La   Re Mim     Re

Mim                             Do
On and on we're charging to the place so many seek
   Lam                Re    Mim                 Re
In perfect synchronicity of which so many speak
   Mim                             Do
We feel so close to heaven in this roaring heavy load
    Lam                  Re       Mim           Si
And then in sheer abandonment, we shatter and explode

Mim                  Sol Re
I'm your turbo lover
Do      La5     Sol Mim
Tell me there's no  other
                     Sol Re
I'm your turbo lover
       La5 Sol Mim
Better run for cover...
