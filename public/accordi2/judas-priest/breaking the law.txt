Lam                             Do     Sol      Lam
There I was completely wasting, out of work and down
                                    Do         Sol     Lam
all inside it's so frustrating as I drift from town to town
Fa                          Do
feel as though nobody cares if I live or die
Fa                                   Mi
so I might as well begin to put some action in my life

Lam                            Do      Sol   Lam
So much for the golden future, I can't even start
                                       Do    Re5   Mi5
I've had every promise broken, there's anger in my heart
Fa                             Do
you don't know what it's like, you don't have a clue
Fa                               Mi
if you did you'd find yourselves doing the same thing too
