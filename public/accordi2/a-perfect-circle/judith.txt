       Do#5                        Mi5
You're such an inspiration for the ways
          Do#5                    Mi5
That I'll never ever choose to be
Do#5                      Mi5
Oh so many ways for me to show you
         Do#5
How your savior has abandoned you
Mi5         Do#5
Fuck your God

Your Lord and your Christ
Mi5        Do#5
He did this

Took all you had and
Mi5           Do#5
Left you this way

Still you pray, you never stray
      Mi5          Do#5
Never taste of the fruit

You never thought to question why

     Do#m#5        Do#5
It's not like you killed someone
     Do#m#5        Do#5
It's not like you drove a hateful spear into his side
Do#m#5      Do#5
Praise the one who left you

Broken down and paralyzed
   Do#                 Lamaj7  Fa#m11  Lamaj7  Fa#m11
He did it all for you

Lamaj7  Mi

   Si     Do#
He did it all for you

Do#m
Oh so many ways for me to show you

How your dogma has abandoned you
Do#5
Pray to your Christ, to your God
      Mi5            Do#5
Never taste of the fruit

Never stray, never break
      Mi5        Do#5
Never choke on a lie
                                 Mi5
Even though he's the one who did this to you
    Do#5
You never thought to question why

     Do#m#5        Do#5
It's not like you killed someone
     Do#m#5        Do#5
It's not like you drove a hateful spear into his side
Do#m#5         Do#5
Talk to Jesus Christ

As if he knows the reasons why
   Do#                 Lamaj7  Fa#m11  Lamaj7  Fa#m11
He did it all for you

Lamaj7  Mi

Si             Do#   Lamaj7  Fa#m11  Lamaj7  Fa#m11
Did it all for you

Lamaj7  Si  Mi

   Si             Do#   Lamaj7  Fa#m11  Lamaj7  Fa#m11
He did it all for you..
