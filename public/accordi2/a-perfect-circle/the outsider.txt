 Help me if you can

It's just that this,

this is not the way I'm wired

So could you please,

Help me understand why

You've given in to all these

Reckless dark desires

Such a mess

Why would I want to watch you,

Do#             Do#m/Si           La          Do#
 Disconnect and self destruct one bullet at a time?
                      Do#m/Si       Fa#      La
What's your rush now, everyone will have his day to die

Do it somewhere far away from here
