I want you by my side
Si                    Re# 
So that I never feel alone again
Sol#m            Fa#      Mi
They've always been so kind
Si                           Re# 
But now they've brought you away from here
Sol#m          Fa#             Mi
I hope they didn't get your mind
Si                        Re# 
Your heart is too strong anyway
Sol#m        Fa#             Mi
We need to fetch back the time
Si                     Re# 
They have stolen from us


Mi 
And I want you
Si
We can bring it on the floor
             Re#               Sol#m
You've never danced like this before
         Fa#
We don't talk about it
Mi                  Si
Dancin' on, do the boogie all night long

Coldest winter for me
Si                 Re# 
No sun is shining anymore
Sol#m        Fa#      Mi
The only thing I feel is pain
Si                 Re# 
Caused by absence of you
Sol#m        Fa#      Mi
Suspense is controlling my mind
Si                 Re# 
I cannot find the way out of here
