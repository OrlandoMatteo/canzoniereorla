All I hear is raindrops
Fa#m            Si7
Falling on the rooftop
Mim7                          Rem7 - Sol7
   Oh baby tell me why'd you have to go
           Domaj7
Cause this pain I feel
           Sim7 - Mim7
It wont go away
      Lam7          Do/Re             Solmaj7
And today I'm officially missing you
                         Fa#m - Si7
I thought that from this heartache
                  Mim7
I could escape
      Rem7 - Sol7                     Domaj7
But I fronted long enough to know
                    Sim7 - Mim7
There ain't no way
      Lam7          Do/Re
And today I'm officially missing you

Fa#m - Si7
Two ears full tears
Mim7                                      Rem7 - Sol7
From looking at your face on the wall ( face on the wall)
            Domaj7              Sim7 - Mim7
Just a week ago you were my baby
                  Lam7

       Domaj7                               Sim7
Well I wish that you would call me right now
        Mim7                        La7/Mi
So that I could get through to you somehow
                         Domaj7       Sim7 - Mim
But I guess it's safe to say baby safe to say
      Lam7               Do/Re

     Famaj7                 Sol              Domaj7 (Domaj7 - Domaj7/Si)
But I see that's something I just can't do
         Lam7            Si7
From the way you would hold me
        Mim -  Rem - Do#dim
To the sweet things you told me
   Lam7
I just can't find a way
                   Do/Re
