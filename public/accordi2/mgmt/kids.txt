Fa#m          Re
You were a child
                   La                Mi/Sol#
Crawling on your knees toward him
Fa#m               Re
Making momma so proud
La                      Mi/Sol#    Fa#m   Re
But your voice is too loud
                  La           Mi/Sol#
We like to watch you laughing
Fa#m                          Re
You pick the insects off of plants
La                         Mi/Sol#
No time to think of consequences


Fa#m                Re
Control yourself
                    La             Mi/Sol#
Take only what you need from it
Fa#m          Re           La       Mi/Sol#
A family of trees wanting to be haunted

Fa#m          Re
The water is warm
                 La             Mi/Sol#
But it's sending me shivers
Fa#m           Re
    A baby is born
La                  Mi/Sol#
  Crying out for attention
Fa#m             Re
   The memories fade
                       La            Mi/Sol#
Like looking through a fogged mirror
Fa#m
    Decisions too
  Re                        La
Decisions are made and not bought
                            Mi/Sol#
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot, 
I guess not
