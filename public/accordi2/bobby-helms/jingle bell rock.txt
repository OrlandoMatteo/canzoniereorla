Re            Remaj7        Re6          Re
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
                       Mim           La7
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Mim          La7         Mim         La7
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
La                  Mim    La7
Now the jingle hop has begun

Re            Remaj7        Re6          Re
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
                      Mim          La7
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Mim          La7          Mim          La7
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
Mim     La      Re
In the frosty air

       Sol                     Solm
What a bright time, it's the right time
   Re               Re7
To rock the night away
       Mi              Mi7
Jingle bell time is a swell time
   La  La7           La         La7
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
                  Si7
Jingle around the clock
Sol       Solm            Mi7       Solm
Mix and mingle in the jingling beat
Mim         La           Re
That's the jingle bell rock
