Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Mi/Si       Si           Do#m     La
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
       Mi/Si    Si            Do#m     Sol#m  La
Is the city I live in, the city of angels
Mi/Si       Si       Do#m       La      Mimaj7
Lonely as I am, together we cry

Mi/Si            Si              Do#m         Sol#m  La
I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
Mi/Si                Si            Do#m             La
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
    Mi/Si          Si             Do#m       Sol#m  La
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Mi/Si     Si          Do#m       La       Mimaj7
I never worry, now that is a lie

Well, I don't ever want to feel like I did that day
Fa#m                    Mi/Si   Si      Fa#m
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way

It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
     Mi/Si        Si        Do#m     La
It's hard to believe and I'm all alone
   Mi/Si          Si             Do#m      Sol#m   La
At least I have her love, the city she loves me
