Mim                      Do
Come to decide that the things that I tried  
     Sol               Re
Were in my life just to get high on.  
Mim                    Do
When I sit alone, come, get a little known,  
Sol                      Re
But I need more than myself this time.  
Mim                        Do
Step from the road to the sea to the sky,  
      Sol               Re
And I do believe that we rely on.  
Mim                   Do                         Sol                Re
When I lay it on, come, get to play it on, all my life to sacrifice. 


Mim   Do  -   Sol        Re      Mim   Do  - Sol - Re
Hey oh,       listen what I say, oh.  
            Mim   Do   - Sol              Re      Mim   Do   - Sol - Re
I got your, hey oh,        now listen what I say, oh.  


Mim                   Do
When  will know that really can’t go  
       Sol                  Re
To the well one more time to decide on.  
Mim                        Do
When it’s killing me, when will really see,  
Sol                  Re
All that I need to look inside ?
Mim                     Do
Come to believe that I better not leave,  
  Sol             Re
Before I get my chance to ride.  
Mim                        Do
When it’s killing me, what do I really need,  
Sol                  Re
All that I need to look inside ?


Mim   Do  - Sol          Re      Mim   Do  - Sol - Re

               Mim  Do   - Sol             Re      Mim   Do   - Sol - Re
Come back and, hey oh,         look at what I say, oh. 


Do
The more I see, the less I know,  
Lam                        Mim  Do
The more I like to let it go, hey oh, oh oh oh.                      

Sol                           Re
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder,  
       Lam
Where it’s so white as snow.  
Sol                      Re
Privately divided by a world so undecided,  
        Lam
And there’s nowhere to go.  
Sol                         Re
In between the cover of another perfect wonder,  
       Lam
Where it’s so white as snow.  
Sol                                      Re
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed,
        Lam
And there’s nowhere to go.

When to descend to amend for a friend,  
        Sol                  Re
All the channels that have broken down.  
Mim                       Do
Now you bring it up, I’m gonna ring it up,  
Sol                Re
Just to hear you sing it out.  
Mim                        Do
Step from the road to the sea to the sky,  

      Sol               Re
And I do believe what we rely on.
