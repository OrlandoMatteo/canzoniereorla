     Re#m  Si  Fa#  Do#

Re#m                    Si
Come to decide that the things that I tried
     Fa#             Do#
Were in my life just to get high on
Re#m               Si
  When I sit alone come get come get a little known
Fa#                    Do#
But I need more than myself this time
Re#m                      Si
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
      Fa#             Do#
And I do believe what we rely on
Re#m
  When I lay it on
Si
Come get to play it on
Fa#            Do#
All my life to sacrifice

Re#m   Si   Fa#       Do#    Re#m   Si  Fa#  Do#
Hey... oh..... listen what I say... oh........ I got your
Re#m   Si   Fa#           Do#    Re#m   Si  Fa#  Do#
Hey... oh..... now listen what I say... oh........

Re#m                    Si
When will I know that I really can't go
       Fa#                Do#
To the well one more time to decide on
Re#m
  When it's killing me
Si
When will I really see
Fa#                Do#
All that I need to look inside
Re#m                   Si
Come to believe that I better not leave
  Fa#           Do#
Before I get my chance to ride
Re#m
  When it's killing me
Si
When will I really see
Fa#                Do#
All that I need to look inside

Re#m   Si   Fa#       Do#    Re#m   Si  Fa#  Do#
Hey... oh..... listen what I say... oh........ I got your
Re#m   Si   Fa#           Do#    Re#m   Si  Fa#  Do#
Hey... oh..... now listen what I say... oh........

The more I see the less I know
                   Do#         Re#m      Do# Simaj7
The more I like to let it go...hey oh oh oh  oh....

Fa#                        Do#
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
           Sol#9
Where it's so white as snow
Fa#                    Do#
Privately divided by a world so undecided
            Sol#9
And there's nowhere to go
Fa#                      Do#
In between the cover of another perfect wonder
           Sol#9
Where it's so white as snow
Fa#                                    Do#
Running through the field where all my tracks will
                          Sol#9
Be concealed and there is nowhere to go...oh!

Re#m                Si
When to descend to amend for a friend
        Fa#                Do#
All the channels that have broken down
Re#m
  Now you bring it up
Si
I'm gonna ring it up
Fa#              Do#
Just to hear you sing it out
Re#m                      Si
