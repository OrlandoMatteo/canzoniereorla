Lam
 They come from every state to find

Some dreams were meant to be declined

Tell the man what did you have in mind

What have you come to do

No turning water into wine

No learning while you're in the line

I'll take you to the broken sign

You see these lights are blue
Lam7
 Come and get it

Lost it at the city limit

Say goodbye

Cause they will find a way to trim it

Everybody

Lookin' for a silly gimmick

Gotta get away

Can't take it for another minute

This town is made of many things

Just look at what the current brings

So high it's only promising

This place was made on you

Fa        Do   Sol          Lam
 Tell me, baby, what's your story?
Fa         Do
 Where you come from
    Sol             Rem
And where you wanna go this time?
Fa        Do    Sol      Lam
 Tell me, lover, are you lonely?
Fa            Do
 The thing we need is

 You're so lovely  Are you lonely?
Fa      Do        Sol7                       Lam
 Giving up on the innocence you left behind

Lam
 Some claim to have the fortitude

Too shrewd to blow the interlude

Sustaining pain to set a mood

Step out to be renewed

I'll move you like a baritone

Jungle brothers on the microphone

Getting over with an undertone

It's time to turn to stone
Lam7
Chitty, chitty, baby

When your nose is in the nitty gritty

Life could be a little sweet

But life could be a little shitty

What a pity

Boston and a Kansas City

Looking for a hundred

But you only ever found a fitty
Lam
 Three fingers in the honeycomb

You ring just like a xylophone

Devoted to the chromosome

The day that you left home
