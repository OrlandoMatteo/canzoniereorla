All around the world we could make time

Rompin' and a stompin' cause I'm in my prime

Born in the north and sworn to entertain ya

'Cause I'm down for the state of Pennsylvania

I try not to whine but I must warn ya

'Bout the motherfuckin' girls from California

Alabama baby said hallelujah

Good god girl I wish I knew ya

 I know I know for sure
Fam                      Dom
 That life is beautiful around the world
Sol#       Solm11
 I know I know it's you
Fam                       Dom
 You say hello and then I say I do

Solm/Fa
Come back baby 'cause I'd like to say

I've been around the world back from Bombay

Fox hole love, pie in your face

Living in and out of a big fat suitcase

Bonafide ride step aside my Johnson

Yes I could in the woods of Wisconsin

Wake up the cake it's a lake she's kissin' me

As they do when.. when they do in Sicily

Sol#       Solm11
 I know I know for sure
Fam                      Dom
 That life is beautiful around the world
Sol#       Solm11
 I know I know it's you
Fam                       Dom
 You say hello and then I say I do

Where you want to go, who you want to be

What you want to do, just come with me

I saw God and I saw the fountains

You and me girl sittin' in the Swiss mountains

Me Oh My O.. me and Guy O

Freer than a bird 'cause we're rockin' Ohio

Around the world I feel dutiful

Take a wife 'cause life is beautiful
