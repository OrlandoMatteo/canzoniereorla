Dom9
 Coming on to the light of day
      Sol#maj7
We got many moons that are deep at play
Dom9
So I keep an eye on the shadow smile
   Sol#maj7
To see what it has to say
Fam7
 You and I both know
Sol#                  Dom
 Everything must go away

What do you say?
Dom9
 Spinning Knot that is on my heart
        Sol#maj7
Is like a bit of light in a touch of dark
      Dom9
You got sneak attack from the zodiac
      Sol#maj7
But I see your fire spark
Fam7
 Eat the breeze and go
Sol#                   Dom
 Blow by blow and go away

What do you say?   Yeah

Sol#
 You don't know my mind
Fam
 You don't know my kind
Dom                   La#
 Dark necessities are part of my design
Sol#
 And tell the world that I'm
Fam
 falling from the sky
Dom                   La#           Dom  Sol#
 Dark necessities are part of my design

Dom  Sol#

Dom9
 Stumble down to the parking lot
       Sol#maj7
You got no time for the afterthought
           Dom9
They're like ice cream for an astronaut
             Lamaj7
Well, that's me looking for we
Fam7
 Turn the corner and
Sol#                        Dom
 Find the world at your command

Playing the hand    Yeah

Sol#
 You don't know my mind
Fam
 You don't know my kind
Dom                   La#
 Dark necessities are part of my design
Sol#
 And tell the world that I'm
Fam
 falling from the sky
Dom                   La#
 Dark necessities are part of my design

Re#  Do#  Fam  Sol#

Re#
Do you want this love of mine?
Do#
Darkness helps us all to shine
Fam                            Sol#
Do you want it? Do you want it now?
Re#
Do you want it all the time?
    Do#
But darkness helps us all to shine
Fam                            Sol#
Do you want it? Do you want it now?

Dom9
 Pick you up like a paper back
       Sol#maj7
With the track record of a maniac
    Dom9
So I move it in and we unpack
         Sol#maj7
It's the same as yesterday
Fam7
 Any way we roll
Sol#                  Dom
 Everything must go away

 You don't know my mind
