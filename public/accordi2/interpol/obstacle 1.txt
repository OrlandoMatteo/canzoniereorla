Fa             Lam
I wish I could eat the salt off
   Fa              Lam
of your lost faded lips
       Fa           Lam
We can cap the old times make
             Fa       Lam
playing only logical harm
       Fa       Lam
We can cap the old lines make
             Fa                  Lam
playing that nothing else will change

            Fa
But she can read, she can read,
        Lam                         Fa
she can read, she can read, she's bad
                      Lam
She can read, she can read,
                     Fa
she can read, she's bad
           Fa   Lam
Oh, she's bad

         Fa                              Fa/Mi
But it's different now that I'm poor and aging
     Lam            Do
I'll never see this face again
       Fa                 Fa/Mi  Lam   Do
You go stabbing yourself in the neck

Fa  Lam  Fa  Lam

           Fa                 Lam
And we can find new ways of living
                  Fa         Lam
Make playing only logical harm
           Fa            Lam
And we can top the old times,
                 Fa                 Lam
Clay-making that nothing else will change

            Fa
But she can read, she can read,
        Lam                         Fa
she can read, she can read, she's bad
                      Lam
She can read, she can read,
                     Fa
she can read, she's bad
           Fa   Lam
Oh, she's bad

     Fa                              Fa/Mi
It's different now that I'm poor and aging
     Lam             Do
I'll never see this face again
       Fa                 Fa/Mi  Lam  Do
You go stabbing yourself in the neck
         Fa                              Fa/Mi
But it's different now that I'm poor and aging
     Lam            Do
I'll never see this face again
            Fa                  Fa/Mi Lam  Do
Let's go go stabbing yourself in the neck
Lam
It's in the way that she posed,

Fa/Do

             Lam                  Fa/Do
She puts the weight, she puts the weight
             Lam   La#            Fa
She puts the weight, she puts the weight
             Rem7                 Fa
She puts the weight, she puts the weight
             Rem7
She puts the weight...
            Fa
It's in the way that she walks
              Rem7
Her heaven is never enough
             Fa
She puts the weights in my heart
             Rem7
She puts, oh she puts the weights
     Do
into my little heart
