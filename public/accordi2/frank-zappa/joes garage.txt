Mi               Mi4                  Mi
We take you now, to a garage, in Canoga Park
   Mi4
It makes it's own sauce...

Mi
 It wasn't very large
          La                  Si
There was just enough room to cram the drums
       Mi
In the corner over by the Dodge
         La
It was a fifty-four
       Si
With a mashed up door
      Mi
And a cheesy little amp
       La                      Si
With a sign on the front said "Fender Champ"
      Mi
And a second hand guitar
         La                  Do#m   Si
It was a Stratocaster with a whammy bar

         Mi
We could jam in Joe's Garage
    La
His mama was screamin'
    Si
His dad was mad
       Mi
We was playin' the same old song
       La            Si
In the afternoon 'n' sometimes we would
Mi
Play it all night long
       La               Si
It was all we knew, 'n' easy too
      Mi
So we wouldn't get it wrong
La             Si
All we did was bend the string like...

Mi   La  Si
         ...Hey!
Mi
Down in Joe's Garage
          La              Si
We didn't have no dope or LSD
      Mi
But a coupla quartsa beer
      La            Si
Would fix it so the intonation
      Mi
Would not offend yer ear
        La                    Si
And the same old chords goin' over 'n' over
  Mi
Became a symphony
         La                 Si
We would play it again 'n' again 'n' again
          Mi
'Cause it sounded good to me  ONE MORE TIME!

Mi   La  Si

         Mi              Do#m7
We could jam in Joe's Garage
    La
His mama was screamin',
 Si
"turn it down!"
       Mi                    Do#m7
We was playing' the same old song
       La            Si
In the afternoon 'n' sometimes we would
Mi                Do#m7
Play it all night long
       La               Si
It was all we knew, and easy too
      Mi                Do#m7
So we wouldn't get it wrong
La                         Si
Even if you played it on a saxophone

Mi   La   Si

   Mi              Do#m7
We thought we was pretty good
   La                       Si
We talked about keepin' the band together
       Mi               Do#m7
'N' we figured that we should
        La                    Si
'Cause about this time we was gettin' the eye
         Mi                   Do#m7
From the girls in the neighborhood
       La                Si
They'd all come over 'n' dance around

like...

      Mi                  Do#m7
So we picked out a stupid name
         La                     Si
Had some cards printed up for a coupla bucks
           Mi             Do#m7
'N' we was on our way to fame
    La                 Si
Got matching suits 'N' Beatle Boots
      Mi                      Do#m7
'N' a sign on the back of the car
           La                 Si
'N' we was ready to work in a GO-GO Bar

ONE TWO THREE FOUR LET'S SEE IF YOU GOT SOME MORE!

Mi    La  Si

Mi
People seemed to like our song
     La                    Si
They got up 'n' danced 'n' made a lotta noise
       Mi
An' it wasn't 'fore very long
  La                 Si
A guy from a company we can't name
        Mi
Said we oughta take his pen
    La                     Si
'N' sign on the line for a real good time
       Mi
But he didn't tell us when
       La                   Si
These "good times" would be somethin'
         Mi
That was really happenin'
       La
So the band broke up
       Si
An' it looks like
        Mi
We will never play again...

Guess you only get one chance in life

To play a song that goes like...

Mi  Si  Fa#m7  Si  Mi  Si  Fa#m7  Si

Mi  Si  Fa#m7  Si  Mi  Si  Fa#m7  Si

         Mi

    Mi
Was really flyin' high, yeah
    La
'N' then they got that Disco thing
    Mi

    La
'N' all of a sudden I thought the time
    Mi

    Mi
