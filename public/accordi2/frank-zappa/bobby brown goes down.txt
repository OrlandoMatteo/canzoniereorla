    Do
She made a little speach then
         Lam
uuh, she tried to make me say when
           Rem7
She had my balls in a vice, but she left the dick
             Sol
I guess it's still hooked on but now it shoots too quick

   With a spindle up my butt 'till it makes me scream
               Rem7             Sol
