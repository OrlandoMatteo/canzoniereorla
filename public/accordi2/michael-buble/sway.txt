La  La7  Rem  Rem


                      Solm
When marimba rhythms start to play
Solm             Rem
Dance with me, make me sway
Rem                Solm
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
La7             Rem
Hold me close, sway me more

                      Solm
Like a flower bending in the breeze
Solm            Rem
Bend with me, sway with ease
Rem                       Solm
When we dance you have a way with me
La7            Rem
Stay with me, sway with me


                  Do 
Other dancers may be on the floor
Do                Fa
But my eyes will see only you
Fa                  La7
Only you have that magic technique
La7                Rem  Rem Rem Si  Si Si La7
When we sway I go weeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaak


                         Solm
I can hear the sounds of violins
Solm          Rem
Long before it begins
Rem                     Solm
Make me thrill as only you know how
La7              Rem
Sway me smooth, sway me now
Rem                     Solm
Make me thrill as only you know how
La7              Rem
Sway me smooth, sway me now


Solm
You know how
La7              Rem   
Sway me smooth, sway me now</pre>]
