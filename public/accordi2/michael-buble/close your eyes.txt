Close your eyes
                           Rem
Let me tell you the reasons why
                      Sol
Think you're one of a kind.
          Do
Here's to you
                              Lam
The one that always pulls us through
                         Rem
Always do what you got to do
                Do
You're one of a kind
                Sol
Thank god your mine.


        Do
You're an angel dressed in armor
Rem                      Sol
You're the fair in every fight
      Do    
You're my life and my safe harbor
Rem                           Sol
Where the sun sets every night
    Fa              Do
And if my love is blind
   Lam         Mim           Fa    Sol
I don't want to see the light.


          Do               
It's your beauty that betrays you
     Rem              Sol
Your smile gives you away.
            Do
Cause you're made of strength and mercy
       Rem               Sol
And my soul is yours to save
   Fa                   Do
And when this much is true
 Lam          Mim          Fa     Do
When my world was dark and blue
   Rem                                 Sol
I know the only one who rescued me was you


           Do
Close your eyes
                               Lam
Let me tell you all the reasons why
                              Rem
You're never going to have to cry
                        Sol
Because you're one of a kind
               Do
Yeah here's to you
                              Lam
The one that always pulls us through
                               Rem
You always do what you got to do babe
                        Do     Sol
Because you're one of a kind.


Rem                           Sol
When your love pours down on me
                   Do
I know I'm finally free
     Domaj7            Lam
So I tell you gratefully
Rem                      Fa

You're the reason why I'm breathing.
