[<pre>Sol Sol/Si Sol7 Do Dom Re Mim La7 Re7


Sol                                Sol/Si
Just because I wander 'round the places we would go
       Sol7                             Do
Hoping that I'd run into you one last time
Lam                            Mim
Just because I never took your picture off my phone
Do                                   Re7sus4 Re7
Doesn't mean that you're still on my mind


Sol                           Sol/Si
Just because I accidentally slipped and said your name
        Sol7                               Do
When I hear our song, it makes me insecure
Dom                             Re         Mim
Just because I know I'll never ever feel the same
La7             Re7           Sol
Doesn't mean I love you anymore


      Re          Sol
Am I lying to myself again
     Re                    Mim              Sol
When I say you're not the best I've ever had?
     Sim          Mim7
Am I lying to myself again
       La7                              Re7   Re Do
When I say that I'm not missing you so bad?


Sol                                Sol/Si
Just because I'm on my knees and swearing I would change
           Sol7                            Do
And I'd do anything to hear you say "I'm yours"
Dom                             Re            Mim
Just because I know I'll never ever feel the same
La7             Re7          Sol Sol/Si Sol7
Doesn't mean I love you anymore
