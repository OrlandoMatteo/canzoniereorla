   Fa     Do/Mi    Rem      
Do you remember me
   Rem  Do                La#
I sat upon your knee
  La#            Fa/La        Solm                   Do       
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
        Fa        Do/Mi        Rem
Well I’m all grown up now
    Rem    Do             La#
Can you still help somehow?
    La#  Fa/La        Solm                           Do
I’m not a child, but my heart still can dream
   Fa             Do/Mi            Rem
So here’s my lifelong wish
   Rem       Do           La#
My grown up Christmas list
    La#  Fa/La       Solm                    Do
Not for myself, but for a world in need


Re         Sim       Sol
No more lives torn apart
     Sol/Mi        La       Fa#m
That wars would never start
    Sim         La        Sol       La       
And time would heal all hearts
Re     Sim                Sol
Every man would have a friend
        Sol/Mi             La       Fa#m
That right would always win
        Sim              La        g#dim7
And love would never end
Fa#m  Sim Mim              La       Re – Re4 - Re 
This is my grown up Christmas list

Re                                               Sol       
What is this illusion called the innocence of youth?
        Sim               Mi
Maybe only in that blind belief
          La                 Do#  
Can we ever find the truth...
