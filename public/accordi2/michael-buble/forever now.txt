Re
  I just met you
La
  It seems like yesterday
Sim
  You opened up your eyes
       Sol
And I recognized your face
              Re                       
You know that you're the one that we've 
             Fa#m
been waiting for
                      Sol
We're gonna keep you safe
              Mim
First time I held you in my arms
            La
I knew I'd love you all the way


Re
   I tuck you in at night
La
  Another day has passed
       Sim                                   Sol
Every week goes by a little faster than the last
                  Re
It wasn't so long ago
             Fa#m                    Sim
We walked together and you held my hand
                       Mim
And now you're getting too big to want to
       La
But I hope you'll always understand


Sol          La                    Re Fa#m
  That I'm always gonna lift you up
Sol          La                 Re Fa#m7
  And I'm never gonna let you down
Sol           La          Sim
  No matter what you do
             Mim
I'm forever proud of you
 Sol            La      Re
I love you forever now


 Re
Through your ears I hear it
La
  Through your eyes I see
Sim
  A world full of magic
         Sol
Full of possibilities
             Re                  Fa#m          
You know as well as anybody how tough this life 
   Sim
can be
               Mim
But you've got so much strength inside you
           La
A strengh I pray you'll never need


Sol          La                    Re Fa#m
  And I'm always gonna lift you up
Sol          La                   Re Fa#m
  And I'm never gonna let you down
Sol       La
  Time flies by
   Sim                   Mi
I hope you realize that I
Sol             La      Re
  Love you forever now


 Re                         Fa#m
I'm always gonna be right here
                            Sol
I'll always gonna cheer you up
                            Solm
I'm always gonna have your back
                    La  Sol
You're never gonna be alone
