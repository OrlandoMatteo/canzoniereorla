It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas

Everywhere you go;
        Mim                  La7      Re            Sim
Take a look in the five-and-ten, glistening once again
       La               Mi           La7
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow.

Toys in every store,
          Mim               La7          Re             Si
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
        Mim/Si La     Re
On your own  front door.

A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots
        Sim       Fa#        Sim
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
 Mi
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
        La       Mi7         La7
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
     La
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.

There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,
      La                Mi               La7
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.

Soon the bells will start,
         Mim                        La7          Re              Si
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
          Mim/Si La     Re
Right within   your heart.
