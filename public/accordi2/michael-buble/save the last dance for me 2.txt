        Re#
You can dance every dance with the guy

Who gives you the eye,
       La#7
Let him hold you tight

You can smile every smile for the man

Who held your hand
            Re#
Beneath the pale moon light
            Sol#
But don't forget who's takin' you home
                         Re#
And in whose arms you're gonna be
    La#7                             Re#
So, darlin', save the last dance for me

      Re#
Oh, I know that the music's fine

Like sparklin' wine,
        La#7sus4       La#7
Go and have your fun
          Sol#/La#
Laugh and sing, but while we're apart

Don't give your heart
Re#
To anyone
             Sol#
And don't forget who's takin' you home

Baby, don't you know I love you so?
                       Re#
Can't you feel it when we touch?
                    La#7
I will never, never let you go
                Re#
I love you, oh, so much

        Mi
You can dance, go and carry on

'Til the night is gone
       Si7
And it's time to go
      Fa#m7          Si7sus4
If he asks if you're all alone

Can he walk you home,
     Mi
You must tell him "No"
                La
'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
              Mi                  Do#m7
And in whose arms you're gonna be
Fa#m7    Si7            Mi
Save the last dance for me

Si7   Mi   Si7   Mi

      Mi
Oh, I know that the music's fine

Like sparklin' wine,
        Si7
Go and have your fun

Laugh and sing, but while we're apart

Don't give your heart
 Mi
To anyone
             La
And don't forget who's takin' you home
                   Mi             Do#m7
And in whose arms you're gonna be
    Fa#m7             Si7            Mi   Mi7
So, darling, save the last dance for me

So, darling, save the last dance for me
Do#7b9              Fa#m7   Si7            Mi
Oh, baby, won't you save the last dance for me?
Do#7b9

Fa#m7    Si7            Mi   Do#7b9
save the last dance for me
         Fa#m7
