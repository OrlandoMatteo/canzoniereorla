I don't know why you think that you could hold me 
          Fa                      Do
When you couldn't get by by yourself 
                 Sol                      Lam        
And I don't know who would ever want to tear the 
           Fa          Do
seam of someone's dream 
           Sol                            Lam
Baby, it's fine, you said that we should just 
be friends 
            Fa                          Do
Well I came up with that line and I'm sure 
                   Sol
That it's for the best 
             Lam                     Fa
If you ever change your mind, don't hold your 
breath

'Cause you may not believe, mmmm 
     Lam           Mi      Mi7
That baby, I'm relieved

When you said goodbye, my whole world shined  
Sol    Sol      Do
Hey hey hey!

It's a beautiful day and I can't stop myself

from smiling

If we're drinking, then I'm buying

And I know there's no denying 
                  Sol              Lam              
It's a beautiful day, the sun is up, the music's 
  Sol
playing 
         Fa              Do
And even if it started raining
           Fa                 Do
You won't hear this boy complaining 
           Fa                    Mi7          
'Cause I'm glad that you're the one that got

It's my turn to fly, so girls, get in line

'Cause I'm easy, no playing this guy like a fool 
        Sol                            Lam           
Now I'm alright, you might've had me caged before, 
    Fa
but not tonight 

 
    Lam             Mi     Mi7
And you may not believe, mmmmm
     Lam            Mi    Mi7
That baby, I'm relieved

This fire inside, it burns too bright 
                Fa                          
I don't want to say "so long", I just want 
  Sol        Do
to say "goodbye" 

 
                 Sol               Lam         
It's a beautiful day and I can't stop myself
