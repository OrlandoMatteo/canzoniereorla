Oh the weather outside is frightful
        Solm7     Fa#dim7 Fam7     Do7
But the fire is so delightful
    Fam             Do7       Fam      Fa#dim7 
And since we've no place to go
       Fam7          La#7         Re#6  Do7  Fam7b5/Si  Sol#maj7/La# 
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!


   Fam7          La#7      Re#maj7     Sol#7
It doesn't show signs of stopping
    Solm7              Fa#dim7   Fam7     Do7
And I've bought some corn for popping
    Fam                Do7       Fam     Fa#dim7
The lights are turned way down low
       Fam7          La#7          Dom7     Fa7
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
         Dom7        Fa7         La#maj7   Sol7   Dom7  Fa7
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
       La#maj7        Dom7     Rem7      Sol7
But if you'll really hold me tight
Do7          Fa7           Fam7     La#7
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
        Solm7         Fa#dim7      Fam7     Do7
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
       Fam          Do7      Fam      Fa#dim7
But as long as you love me so
       Solm7          La#7          Re#
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!
