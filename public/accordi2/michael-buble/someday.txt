Sol
  I love seeing you happy
Lam
  I miss seeing that smile
Re                           Sol
  It's been such a long time 
Sol
  And although I don't have you
Lam
  I know now that I need to
Re                           Sol
  And somehow make you mine


            Mim
And I won't lie
          Si/Re#            Sol
It's hard seeing you with him
       La/Do#            Do              Dom
'Cause I know he can't hold you like I can


Sol             Lam
Someday maybe when we're old and grey
Re                        Sol
We could be in love once more
Sol                 Lam
Till then I won't give my love away
         Re                Sol
Darling, I'm forever only yours


Sol
  I remember the love song
Lam
  I sang every word wrong
Re                    Sol
  But you didn't mind
No, no
Sol
  And I'll admit that I miss you
Lam
  But only if you do
Re                          Sol
  'cause you know that I'm shy


            Mim
And I can't lie
          Si/Re#            Sol
It's hard seeing you with her
       La/Do#             Do              Dom
'cause I know she can't love you like I can

  And my love then what's for you then
Lam
  We got nothing to lose
       Re                Sol
'cause I'm forever only yours
Mim
  No need to complicate it
Lam
  A smile is worth the waiting
Re                Sol
I'm forever only yours

  Someday maybe
Lam
  Someday maybe
Re                       Sol
  Someday maybe I'll be yours
Sol
  Someday maybe
Lam
  Someday maybe
Re                       Sol
  Someday maybe I'll be yours
