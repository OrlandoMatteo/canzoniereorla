       Do#   Sol#7

Do#           Sol#
 I don't know why
               La#m
You think that you could hold me
         Fa#
When you couldn't get by
       Do#
By yourself
                 Sol#                    La#m
And I don't know who would ever want to tear the seam
   Fa#
Of someone's dream
Do#         Sol#
 Baby, it's fine,
                        La#m
You said that we should just be friends
             Fa#
Well, I came up with that line
        Do#                    Sol#
And I'm sure that it's for the best
            La#m
If you ever change your mind,
      Fa#
Don't hold your breath
    La#m             Fa7add6 Fa7
'Cause you may not believe,
 La#m             Fa7add6 Fa7
That, baby, I'm relieved,
    Fa#
When you said goodbye,
   Sol#7                Do#
My whole world shined

                  Sol#
It's a beautiful day and
        La#m             Sol#4
I can't stop myself from smiling
         Fa#               Do#
If we're drinking, then I'm buying
      Fa#              Do#    Sol#   Do#
And I know there's no denying
                 Sol#             La#m
It's a beautiful day, the sun is up,
            Sol#4
the music's playing
            Fa#       Do#
And even if it started raining
          Fa#             Do#
You won't hear this boy complaining
           Fa#                 Fa7          La#m   Sol#
'Cause I'm glad that you're the one who got away
                 Do#
It's a beautiful day

Do#              Sol#
 It's my turn to fly,
                  La#m
So, girls, get in line
                    Fa#                    Do#
'Cause I'm easy, no playing this guy like a fool
          Sol#
Now I'm alright
                La#m              Fa#
Might've had me caged before, but not tonight
    La#m          Fa7add6  Fa7
And you may not believe,
      La#m        Fa7add6  Fa7
That, baby, I'm relieved
 Fa#                Sol#
This fire inside: it burns too bright
              Fa#maj7
I don't wanna say "so long",
             Sol#7               Do#
I just wanna to say "goodbye"

                  Sol#
It's a beautiful day and
        La#m             Sol#4
I can't stop myself from smiling
         Fa#               Do#
If we're drinking, then I'm buying
      Fa#              Do#    Sol#   Do#
And I know there's no denying
                 Sol#             La#m
It's a beautiful day, the sun is up,
            Sol#4
the music's playing
            Fa#       Do#
And even if it started raining
          Fa#             Do#
You won't hear this boy complaining
           Fa#                 Fa7          La#m   Sol#
'Cause I'm glad that you're the one who got away

       Fa#                   Do#
'Cause if you ever think I'll take up
          Fa#               Do#
My time with thinking of our break-up
            Fa#        Fa7               La#m  Sol#
Then you've got another thing coming your way
                        Do#  Sol#  La#m  Fa#
'Cause it's a beautiful day,
          Do#
Beautiful day,
    Sol#
Oh, baby, any day
            La#m       Fa#
That you're gone away
             Do#
It's a beautiful day
