Fa       Lam             Solm    Do
Stars shining bright above you

Fa        Lam             Re        Re7
Night breezes seem to whisper I love you

Solm                     La#m
Birds singing in the sycamore tree

Lam             Sol#m      Solm  Do
Dream a little dream of me

Fa    Lam              Solm    Do
Sing nighty night and kiss me

Fa    Lam                Re             Re7
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me

Solm                  La#m
While I'm alone and blue as can be

Lam            Sol#m   Solm Fa   La# Do
Dream a little dream of me


Fa     Lam          Solm     Do
Stars fading but I linger on dear

Fa     Lam           Solm      Do
Still craving your kiss

Fa   Lam          Solm         Do
I'm longing to linger till dawn dear

Fa    Lam     Mi
Just saying this

Fa     Lam               Solm       Do
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you

Fa     Lam                    Re          Re7
Sweet dreams that leave our worries behind you

Solm                    La#m
But in your dreams, whatever they be

Lam             Sol#m   Solm Fa
Dream a little dream of me</pre>]
