Re   Remaj7   Re7   Sol   Mim 


Re             Remaj7      Re7     Sol                   Mim
Stockings are hung with care as children sleep with one eye open 
Re                           Remaj7    Re7               Sol            Mim
Well, now there's more than toys at stake ‘cause I'm older now but not done hoping 


Re   Remaj7   Re7   Sol   Mim 


Re           Remaj7    Re7        Sol             Mim
The twinkling of the lights as Santa carols fill the household 
Re                 Remaj7  Re7     Sol                         Mim
Old Saint Nick has taken flight with a heart on board so please be careful 


Fa#   Sim             Lam              Mim
Each year I ask for many different things 
Fa#        Sim           Mim          Mim7    Sol     Mi/Sol# 
But now I know what my heart wants you to bring 

[Chorus 1]
La              Sim                Re       Sol     Mi/Sol#
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas 
La               Sim                     Re         Sol     Mi/Sol#
There's nothing else that I (you) will need this Christmas 
La            Sim              Sol                          Re/Fa#
It won't be wrapped under a tree; I want something that lasts forever 
Mim                  La             Re
So kiss me on this cold December night


Re   Remaj7   Re7   Sol   Mim 

 
Re           Remaj7     Re7      Sol                        Mim
A tree that smells of pine; a house that's filled with joy and laughter 
Re                  Remaj7    Re7    Sol              Mim
The mistletoe says stand in line; loneliness is what I've captured 


Fa#           Sim          Lam        Mim
Oh, but this evening can be a holy night
      Fa#             Sim            Mim        Mim7       Sol    Mi/Sol#
Let’s cozy on up the fireplace and dim those Christmas lights 

[Chorus 1]
La              Sim                Re       Sol     Mi/Sol#
So please just fall in love with me this Christmas 
La               Sim                     Re         Sol     Mi/Sol#
There's nothing else that I (you) will need this Christmas 
La            Sim              Sol                          Re/Fa#
It won't be wrapped under a tree; I want something that lasts forever 
Mim                  La             Re
So kiss me on this cold December night


Re                Remaj7     Re7     Sol              Mim
They call it the season of giving; I'm here, I'm yours for the taking 
Re                Remaj7     Re7     Sol              Mim    Mi/Sol#    
They call it the season of giving; I'm here, I'm yours 


La    Sim                Re       Sol     Mi/Sol#
Just fall in love with me this Christmas 
La               Sim                Re         Sol     Mi/Sol#
There's nothing else that we will need this Christmas
La            Sim              Sol                          Re/Fa#
It won't be wrapped under a tree; I want something that lasts forever 
Mim                  La          Sol
Cause I don't wanna be alone tonight 
                     Re/Fa#                Mim                  La         Sol
I'll wear you like a Christmas sweater, walk proudly to the mistletoe tonight 
                      Re/Fa#                          
I want something that lasts forever
Mim                 La              Re
So kiss me on this cold December night 


Re   Remaj7   Re7   Sol   Mim 


Re                Remaj7     Re7     Sol              Mim
They call it the season of giving; I'm here, I'm yours for the taking 
Re                Remaj7     Re7     Sol              Mim   
They call it the season of giving; I'm here, I'm yours
