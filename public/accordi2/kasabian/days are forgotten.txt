Lam
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Lam
Hey son, I'm looking forward

You're leaning backwards of this I'm sure

Have you had enough? Are you feeling rough?

Does your skull hurt? Well if it's warm

Cause I am taking back what's mine, I am taking back the time

You may call it suicide but I'm being born again, I'm waiting

Lam
Ah, I'm waiting, ah, right here now, I'm waiting
                     Mi
For someone or something to take me, to take me over

Lam               Fa     Sol
Days, days are forgotten
             Lam            Fa      Sol
Now it's all over simply forgotten, how to disappear

Lam
Home bred, I've got blood lust

Feeding you bread crust, I leave no scar

You say I'm old hat, a fucking dirty rat

Call me a cliche how right you are
                                       Fa
Cause I am flipping bag of bones, I am righting all your wrongs
        Lam
You may call it suicide but I'm being born again, I'm waiting

Lam
Ah, I'm waiting, ah, right here now, I'm waiting
                     Mi
For someone or something to take me to take me over

Lam               Fa     Sol
Days, days are forgotten
             Lam            Fa      Sol
Now it's all over simply forgotten, how to disappear
Lam               Fa     Sol
Days, days are forgotten
             Lam            Fa      Sol
Now it's all over simply forgotten, how to disappear

Mi
 I saw something, I get on the dark, it's the
                                     Lam
You was at home chewing on monkey brains
Fa                                  Mi
 I am not here, I'm just a silhouette

You will never ever ever forget

Lam               Fa     Sol
Days, days are forgotten
             Lam            Fa      Sol
Now it's all over simply forgotten, how to disappear
Lam               Fa     Sol
Days, days are forgotten
             Lam            Fa      Sol
Now it's all over simply forgotten, how to disappear

Lam   Fa Sol  Lam   Fa Sol
