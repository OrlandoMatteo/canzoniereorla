Mim
 I ain't easy

I make you mad

Least I ain't sleazy
         La#               La    Re Mim
I'm just trying to put the world to rights

And if you want to, I'll take you out

'Cause I got the feeling that
    La#            La Sol
I'm gonna keep you up all
La#            La Sol
Gonna keep you up all
La#            La Sol Mim
Gonna keep you up all night

Mim
Tired of taking orders

Coping with disorders

The wrong men have the power

It's turning my milk sour

We're tired of taking orders

Coping with disorders

The wrong men have the power

It's turning my milk sour

Turning my milk sour

Turning my milk sour

I'm just trying to put the world to rights

And if you want to, I'll take you out

'Cause I got the feeling that
    La#            La Re  Mim
I'm gonna keep you up all night

I ain't easy

But I ain't that bad

No rhyme or reason,
         La#               La    Re Mim
I'm just trying to set the world alight

You got problems, well so have I

And I got the feeling that
    La#            La Sol
I'm gonna keep you up all
La#            La Sol
Gonna keep you up all
La#            La Sol Mim
Gonna keep you up all night

        Mim
There's cobras in the mosh pit

Finally we lost it

Everyday is brutal

Now we're being watched by Google

Gotta keep it simple

Sending out a signal

Everyone's on bugle

Now we're being watched by Google

Being watched by Google

Being watched by Google
