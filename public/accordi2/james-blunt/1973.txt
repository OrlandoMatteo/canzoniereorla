You're getting older
               Re
Your journey's been
               La     Mi
Etched on your skin

Wish I had known that
               Re
What seemed so strong
             Mi     Do#7/Fa
Has been and gone

        Fa#m
I would call you up every Saturday night
       Fa#m/Mi
And we both stayed out till the morning light
       Re                 La     Mi
And we sang, "Here we go again"
           Fa#m
And though time goes by

I will always be
     Fa#m/Mi
In a club with you
     Re

                     La     Mi
Singing "Here we go again"

So I could see clearly now

          Re
My memory plays our tune
             Mi    Do#7/Fa
The same old song

        Fa#m
I would call you up every Saturday night
