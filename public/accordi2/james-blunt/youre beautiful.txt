My life is brilliant.
Sol/Fa#
My love is pure.
Mim7
I saw an angel.
Doadd9
Of that I'm sure.
    Sol
She smiled at me on the subway.
        Sol/Fa#
She was with another man.
    Mim7
But I won't lose no sleep on that,
       Doadd9      Re/Fa#
'Cause I've got a plan.


Doadd9        Re/Fa# Mim7          Re/Fa#
You're beautiful. You're beautiful.
Doadd9        Re/Fa#      Sol
You're beautiful, it's true.
  Doadd9    Re/Fa#      Sol   Re/Fa# Mim7
I saw your face in a crowded  place,
      Doadd9      Re/Fa#    Mim7
And I don't know what to do.
            Doadd9 Re/Fa#    Sol     Sol/Fa#    Mim7     Doadd9
'Cause I'll never be with you.


          Sol
Yeah, she caught my eye, 
      Sol/Fa#
As we walked on by.
          Mim7
She could see from my face that I was, 
Doadd9
  Fucking high, 
    Sol                       Sol/Fa#
And I don't think that I'll see her again, 
    Mim7                          Doadd9
But we shared a moment that will last till the end. 




Doadd9        Re/Fa# Mim7          Re/Fa#
You're beautiful. You're beautiful.
Doadd9        Re/Fa#      Sol
You're beautiful, it's true.
  Doadd9    Re/Fa#      Sol   Re/Fa# Mim7
I saw your face in a crowded  place,
      Doadd9      Re/Fa#    Mim7
And I don't know what to do.
            Doadd9 Re/Fa#    Sol
'Cause I'll never be with you.

Doadd9        Mim7          Doadd9          Re/Fa#  Doadd9  Re/Fa#
  La la la la, la la la la, la la la la, la




Doadd9        Re/Fa# Mim7          Re/Fa#
You're beautiful. You're beautiful.
Doadd9        Re/Fa#      Sol
You're beautiful, it's true.
      Doadd9      Re/Fa#         Sol        Re/Fa# Mim7
There must be an angel with a smile on her  face,
         Doadd9                    Re/Fa#          Sol Re/Fa# Mim7
When she thought up that I should be with you.
         Doadd9   Re/Fa#     Mim7
But it's time to face the truth,
       Doadd9 Re/Fa#     Sol
I will never be with you.</pre>]
