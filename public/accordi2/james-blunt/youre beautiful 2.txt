Re#                   La#  Dom7  Sol#add9
 My life is brilliant
Re#
 My life is brilliant
La#
 My love is pure
Dom7
 I saw an angel
Sol#add9
 Of that I'm sure
    Re#
She smiled at me on the subway
 La#
She was with another man
    Dom7
But I won't lose no sleep on that,

'Cause I've got a plan

Sol#add9       La# Re#
 You're beautiful   You're beautiful
Sol#add9       La#        Re#
 You're beautiful, it's true
  Sol#add9   La#      Re#   La#/Re Dom7
I saw your face in a crowded    place,
      Sol#  La#  Dom7
And I don't know what to do
            Sol#   La#     Re#  La#  Dom7  Sol#add9
'Cause I'll never be with you

     Re#
Yeah, she caught my eye,
      La#/Re
As we walked on by
   Dom7
She could see from my face that I was,
Sol#add9
  Fucking high,
     Re#      La#/Re
And I don't think that I'll see her again,
       Dom7    Sol#add9
But we shared a moment that will last till the end

Sol#add9       La# Re#
 You're beautiful   You're beautiful
Sol#add9       La#        Re#
 You're beautiful, it's true
  Sol#add9   La#      Re#   La#/Re Dom7
I saw your face in a crowded    place,
      Sol#  La#  Dom7
And I don't know what to do
            Sol#   La#     Re#
'Cause I'll never be with you

Sol#      Dom   Sol#      Dom
  La la la la, la la la la...

Sol#  Dom  Fam  La#

Sol#add9       La# Re#
 You're beautiful   You're beautiful
Sol#add9       La#        Re#
 You're beautiful, it's true
      Sol#         La#         Re#      La#/Re Dom7
There must be an angel with a smile on her   face
         Sol#                      La#       Re# La#/Re Dom7
When she thought up that I should be with you
         Sol#     La#       Dom7
But it's time to face the truth
       Sol#    La#     Re#
I will never be with you
