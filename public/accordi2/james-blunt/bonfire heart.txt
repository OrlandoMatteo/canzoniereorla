     Do
Your mouth is a revolver
                      Mim   Do
Firing bullets in the sky

Your love is like a soldier,
              Mim   Fa
Loyal 'til you die

And I’ve been looking at the stars
            Sol  Lam
For a long, long time

I’ve been putting out fires
    Sol/Si Do
All my     life

Everybody wants a flame,
                        Sol
They don’t want to get burnt
                       Do
And today is our turn
                          Lam
Days like these lead to...
                          Fa
Nights like this lead to

Love like ours
              Lam                 Sol   Do
You light the spark in my bonfire heart
                        Lam
People like us—we don’t
                     Sol   Fa
Need that much, just some

One that starts,
           Lam                  Sol
Starts the spark in our bonfire hearts

Do
 This world is getting colder
                   Mim   Do
Strangers passing by

No one offers you a shoulder
                         Mim   Fa
No one looks you in the eye

But I’ve been looking at you
                 Lam
For a long, long time

Just trying to break through,
               Sol/Si Do
Trying to make you    mine

Everybody wants a flame,
                       Sol
They don’t want to get burnt
                         Do
Well, today is our turn

Our bonfire hearts
             Do
Our bonfire hearts

You light the spark
