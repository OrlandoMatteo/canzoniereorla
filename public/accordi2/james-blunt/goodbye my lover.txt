       Mi  Do#m  La  Si7add6

Mi                   Do#m
 Did I disappoint you or let you down?
La                                        Si
 Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
Mi                     Do#m
'Cause I saw the end before we'd begun,
      Sol#m                      La         Si
Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won
 Mi                Do#m
So I took what's mine by eternal right
La                           Si7add6
 Took your soul out into the night
Mi                     Do#m
 It may be over but it won't stop there,
     Sol#m                 La   Si
I am here for you if you'd only care
    Mi
You touched my heart you touched my soul
    Do#m
You changed my life and all my goals
    La
And love is blind and that I knew when,
              Si7add6
My heart was blinded by you
     Mi
I've kissed your lips and held your head
Do#m
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
  Sol#m
I know you well, I know your smell
La             Si7add6     Mi
 I've been addicted to you
                Do#m
Goodbye my lover
                 La
Goodbye my friend

You have been the one

Goodbye my lover

Goodbye my friend

You have been the one
         Si7add6             Mi  La
You have been the one for me

Mi             Do#m
 I am a dreamer but when I wake
La
 You can't break my spirit
         Si7add6
it's my dreams you take
Mi                 Do#m
 And as you move on, remember me,
Sol#m                  La       Si
 Remember us and all we used to be
     Mi
I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile
     Do#m
I've watched you sleeping for a while
    La
I'd be the father of your child
            Si7add6
I'd spend a lifetime with you
  Mi
I know your fears and you know mine
      Do#m
We've had our doubts but now we're fine,
    Sol#m                          La
And I love you, I swear that's true
         Si             Mi
I cannot live without you

                Do#m
Goodbye my lover
                 La
Goodbye my friend

You have been the one
          Si7add6           Mi
You have been the one for me
               Do#m
Goodbye my lover
                La
Goodbye my friend

You have been the one
         Si7add6             Mi  La  Mi  Si
You have been the one for me

La            Si                Do#m
 And I still hold your hand in mine
   Sol#m                 La
In mine when I'm asleep
           Do#m            Sol#m
And I will bear my soul in time,
         La             Si       Mi
When I'm kneeling at your feet

                Do#m
Goodbye my lover
                 La
Goodbye my friend

You have been the one
          Si7add6           Mi

Goodbye my friend

You have been the one
         Si7add6             Mi
You have been the one for me
                    Do#m
I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow
Sol#m           La      Si     Mi
 I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow
                    Do#m
I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow
Sol#m           La      Si     Mi
 I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow
