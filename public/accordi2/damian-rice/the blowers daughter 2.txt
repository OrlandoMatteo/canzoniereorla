             Mi
And so it is
                        Laadd9
Just like you said it would be
                Si
Life goes easy on me
 Laadd9        Mi    Laadd9
Most of the time
            Mi
And so it is
                  Laadd9
The shorter story
                  Si
No love, no glory
                Do#m7
No hero in her sky
                Laadd9
I can't take my eyes off you
                Sol#m7
I can't take my eyes off you
                Fa#m11
I can't take my eyes off you
                Mi
I can't take my eyes off you
                Laadd9        Si
I can't take my eyes off you
                Laadd9   Si
I can't take my eyes...

            Mi
And so it is
                          Laadd9
Just like you said it should be
                        Si
We'll both forget the breeze
Laadd9        Mi   Mi4 Mi
Most of the time

And so it is
                 Laadd9
The colder water
                      Si
The blower's daughter
                Do#m7
The pupil in denial
                 Laadd9
I can't take my eyes off you
                 Sol#m7
I can't take my eyes off you
                 Fa#m11
I can't take my eyes off you
                 Mi
I can't take my eyes off you
                 Laadd9      Si
I can't take my eyes off you
                Laadd9    Si
I can't take my eyes...

Fa#                Si
  Did I say that I loathe you?
                 Sol#m7
Did I say that I want to
Do#            Re#m7
Leave it all behind?

                 Si
I can't take my mind off you
                 La#m7
I can't take my mind off you
                Sol#m7
I can't take my mind off you
                Fa#
I can't take my mind off you
                Si            Do#
I can't take my mind off you
                Si
I can't take my mind...

My mind...my mind...

'Til I find somebody new
