       Fa#  La#m7  Sol#m  Re#m

Fa#                       Fa#maj7
 No matter how hard I try

You keep pushing me aside
      Si
And I can't break through
           Do#
There's no talking to you
        Fa#
It's so sad that you're leaving
         La#m7               Si
It takes time to believe it
                                Do#
But after all is said and done

You're gonna be the lonely one

Oh, oh
Fa#        Do#                Sol#m7   Si
 Do you believe in life after love?
      Fa#              Do#
I can feel something inside me say,
   Sol#m7                    Re#m
"I really don't think you're strong enough, no"
Fa#        Do#                Sol#m7  Si

"I really don't think you're strong enough, no"

Fa#
 What am I supposed to do?
Fa#maj7
 Sit around and wait for you?
        Si
Well, I can't do that
        Do#
There's no turning back
       Fa#
I need time to move on
       La#m7                 Si
I need love to feel strong
                                          Do#
'Cause I've had time to think it through

And maybe I'm too good for you

Oh, oh
Fa#        Do#                Sol#m7   Si

                           Do#          Re#m
Well, I know that I'll get through this
                         Do#
'Cause I know that I am strong
        Si
I don't need you anymore
            Do#
Oh, I don't need you anymore
        Si                Sol#m7
I don't need you anymore
            Do#
No, I don't need you anymore
