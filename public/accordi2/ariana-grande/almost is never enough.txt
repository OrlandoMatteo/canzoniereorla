[<pre>Re                                Lam
I like to say we gave it a try
Sol                                 Solm
I like to blame it all on life
Re                         Lam
Maybe we just weren’t right
Sol                  Solm
But that’s a lie, that’s a lie


Sim                    LaA#+
And we can deny it as much as we want
       Re                     Mi
But in time our feelings will show
       Sol
Cause sooner or later
       Re
We'll wonder why we gave up
    La#                La
The truth is everyone knows


Re       Lam                   Sol
Almost, almost is never enough
Solm                   Re
So close to being in love
Lam                             Sol
If I would have known that you wanted me
        Solm
The way I wanted you

     Sim                   La#+
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
    Lam                 Sol
But right here in each others arms
    Re          Lam                  Sol
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
    Solm               Re
But almost is never enough


Re                    Lam
If I could change the world overnight
Sol                      Solm
There'd be no such thing as goodbye
Re                      Lam
You'll be standing right where you were
Sol                    Solm
We'd get the chance we deserve


Sim                 La#+
Try to deny it as much as you want
       Re                     Mi
But in time our feelings will show
