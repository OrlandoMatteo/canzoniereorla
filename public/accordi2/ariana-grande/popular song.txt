Standing on the field with your pretty pompoms

 My problem, I never was a model

 Popular, I know about popular
                                La#

 Re#                  La#
 Always on the lookout for someone to hate,
 Sol#            Re#
 Picking on me like a dinner plate
                             La#
 You hid during classes, and in between them
 Sol#                            Re#
 Dunked me in the toilets, now it's you that cleans them
                                        La#
 You tried to make me feel bad with the things you do
 Sol#                Re#

                La#
 Ooh, the joke's on you

 'Cause that's the only thing that
     Re#                  La#
I've learned at school, boy (uh huh)
         Sol#                   Re#
