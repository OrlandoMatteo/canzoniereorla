[<pre>        Do
I was a quick wet boy
           Lam
Diving too deep for coins
            Fa
All of your street light eyes
          Sol
Wide on my plastic toys
             Do
And when the cops closed the fair
         Lam
I cut my long baby hair
           Fa
Stole me a dog-eared map
                  Sol
And called for you everywhere

      Do
Have I found you?
Lam               Fa        Sol
Flightless bird, jealous, weeping
 Do
Or lost you?
 Lam
American mouth
Fa        Sol
Big pill looming

          Do
Now Iâ€™m a fat house cat
           Lam
Nursing my sore blunt tongue
             Fa
Watching the warm poison rats
                 Sol
Curl through the wide fence cracks
           Do
Pissing on magazine
            Lam
Photos, those fishing lures
               Fa
Thrown in the cold and clean
               Sol
Blood of Christ mountain stream

      Do
Have I found you?
Lam               Fa         Sol
Flightless bird, grounded, bleeding
 Do
Or lost you?
 Lam
American mouth
Fa         Sol          Do
Big pill, stuck going down</pre>]
