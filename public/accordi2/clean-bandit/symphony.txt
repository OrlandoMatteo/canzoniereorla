       Re#  Sol# Re#   Dom Solm  Sol#

Re#                     Sol# Re#
I've been hearing symphonies
Dom          Solm         Sol#
Before all I heard was silence
  Re#                  Sol#  Re#
A rhapsody for you and me
    Dom       Solm   Sol#
And every melody is timeless
Re#                    Sol#/Re# Re#
Life was stringing me along
Dom            Solm        Sol#
Then you came and you cut me loose
    Re#                Sol#/Re# Re#
Was solo singing on my own
    Dom          Solm         Sol#
Now I can't find the key without you
             Sol#            Dom
And now your song is on repeat
                Solm            Sol#
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat
                                  Dom
And when you're gone, I feel incomplete
                   La#
So if you want the truth

                             Sol#       Dom
I just wanna be part of your symphony
                 Solm              Sol#
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
          Dom
Symphony
                 Solm     Sol#
Like a love song on the radio
                 Solm              Sol#
Will you hold me tight and not let go?

    Re#                   Sol# Re#
I'm sorry if it's all too much
    Dom           Solm         Sol#
And every day you're here, I'm healing
    Re#                  Sol#  Re#
And I was runnin' out of luck
  Dom               Solm      Sol#
I never thought I'd find this feeling
       Dom       Solm          Sol#   Re#
'Cause I've been hearing symphonies
Dom          Re#/Sol     Sol#
Before all I heard was silence
           Solm        Sol#
A rhapsody for you and me
Re#
(A rhapsody for you and me)
    Dom       Solm  Sol#
And every melody is timeless
             Sol#           Dom
And now your song is on repeat
                Solm            Sol#
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat
                                    Dom
