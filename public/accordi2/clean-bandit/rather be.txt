[<pre>       Mim         Re        Do     
We're a thousand miles from comfort, 
 Sol          Mim         Re        Do  Sol
we have traveled land and sea
       Mim      Re        Do    
But as long as you are with me, 
      Sol  Lam
there's no place I rather be
Mim     Re     Do      
I would wait forever, 
Sol Mim     Re        Do            Sol
exulted in the scene
    Mim     Re      Do    
As long as I am with you, 
  Sol          Lam
my heart continues to beat


Mim                        Re/Fa#
With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
Sol               Lam
Strolling so casually
Mim                        Re/Fa#
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Sol               Lam
Switch up the batteries


Mim     Re         Do              Sol
If you gave me a chance I would take it
Mim     Re           Do            Sol
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
Mim        Re/Fa#                  Do        Sol
Know with all of your heart, you can't shame me
Lam         Sim                  Do           Sol
When I am with you, there's no place I rather be

N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I rather be

N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I rather be

N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I rather be 


   Mim       Re   Do    Sol   Mim   Re    Do    Sol
We staked out on a mission to find our inner peace
Mim      Re    Do     Sol    Lam
Make it everlasting so nothing's incomplete
   Mim    Re   Do     Sol  Mim      Re    Do    Sol
It's easy being with you, sacred simplicity
     Mim      Re       Do   Sol         Lam
As long as we're together, there's no place I rather be
