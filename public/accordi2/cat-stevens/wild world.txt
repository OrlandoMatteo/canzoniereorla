Lam             Re                  Sol
  Now that I've lost every thing to you,
            Domaj7                    Fa
You say you want to start something new,
         Rem                      Mi
And it's breaking my heart you're leaving, . . . baby I'm grieving.

Lam                  Re              Sol
  But if you want to leave take good care
                Domaj7                  Fa
Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
           Rem                     Mi      Sol  Sol/Fa  Sol/Mi  Sol/Re
But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there

Do    Sol              Fa
  Ooh baby baby it's a wild world
Sol                Fa             Do
  It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Do    Sol              Fa
  Ooh baby baby it's a wild world
Sol                 Fa                Do          Rem  Mi
  And I'll always remember you like a child girl

Lam                    Re                        Sol
  You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do
         Domaj7                 Fa
And it's breaking my heart in two
        Rem                   Mi
Cause I never want ot see you sad girl, . . .Don't be a bad girl

Lam                  Re              Sol
  But if you want to leave take good care,

           Rem                         Mi    Sol  Sol/Fa  Sol/Mi  Sol/Re
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware

Do    Sol              Fa
  Ooh baby baby it's a wild world
Sol                Fa             Do
  It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Do    Sol              Fa
  Ooh baby baby it's a wild world
Sol                 Fa                Do          Rem  Mi
  And I'll always remember you like a child girl
