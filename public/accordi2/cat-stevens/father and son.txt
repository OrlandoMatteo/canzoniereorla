It's not time to make a change, just relax and take it easy

You're still young, that's your fault, there's so much you have to know
       Sol            Re/Fa#         Do                Lam7
Find a girl, settle down, if you want to, you can marry
        Sol        Mim           Lam   Lam Lam7 Re
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy
      Sol                 Re          Do                  Lam7
I was once like you are now, and I know that it's not easy
      Sol                Mim                    Lam Lam Lam7 Re

But take your time, think a lot, why think of everything you've got
             Sol                 Mim             Re          Sol   Do/Sol

How can I try to explain? 'cause when I do he turns away again
     Sol               Mim             Lam7   Re
It's always been the same, same old story
         Sol              Sim         Do          Lam7
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen
              Sol          Mim          Re       Sol
Now there's a way, and I know that I have to go away

It's not time to make a change, just sit down and take it slowly

        Sol               Sim             Do                Lam7
All the times that I've cried, keeping all the things I knew inside

If they were right, I'd agree, but it's them they know, not me
