But why do I feel this party's over?

No pain

 You're like perfection
                   Sol#m   Re#m
How do I feel this good sober?

A----h, the night is calling?
       Fa#            Sol#m           Re#m  Simaj7
And it whispers to me softly come and play
Fa#  Si      Re#m
A----h, I am falling
         Fa#                   Sol#m       Re#m
