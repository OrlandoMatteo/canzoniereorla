So, so you think you can tell,
             Lam/Mi                   Sol
Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.

Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail, a smile from a veil,
                      Sol
Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts,
                Lam/Mi                  Sol                             Re/Fa#
Hot ashes for trees, hot air for a cool breeze, cold comfort for change,
                  Do                        Lam                         Sol
And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here.
           Lam/Mi                                    Sol                Re/Fa#
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
                                  Do
Running over the same old ground. What have we found?
             Lam                         Sol
The same old fears. Wish you were here!
