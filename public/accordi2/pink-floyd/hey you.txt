        Mim   Rem9   Mim9   Rem9

     Mim9
Hey, you!

Out there in the cold

Getting lonely, getting old
        Sim9
Can you feel me?
     Mim9
Hey, you!

Standing in the aisles

With itchy feet and fading smiles
        Sim9      Re
Can you feel me?

Hey, you!
                            Sol Re Do
Don't help them to bury the light
Sim           Lam        Mim9   Rem9
 Don't give in without a fight

     Mim9
Hey, you!

Out there on your own

Sitting naked by the phone
          Sim9
Would you touch me?
     Mim9
Hey, you!

With your ear against the wall

Waiting for someone to call out
          Sim9      Re
Would you touch me?

Hey, you!
                               Sol Re Do
Would you help me to carry the stone?
Sim              Lam         Mim
 Open your heart, I'm coming home

Mim    Lam    Mim    Lam

Mim    Lam    Mim    Lam    Mim

Do      Re       Sol Re Do
 But it was only fantasy
                 Re      Sol Re  Do
The wall was too high as you can see
                 Re             Sol Re    Do
No matter how he tried he could not break free
                  Re       Mim9    Rem9
And the worms ate into his brain

Mim9   Rem9   Mim9   Rem9   Mim9   Rem9

     Mim9
Hey, you!

Out there on the road,

Always doing what you're told
        Sim9
Can you help me?
     Mim9
Hey, you!

Out there beyond the wall,

Breaking bottles in the hall
        Sim9    Re
Can you help me?

Hey, you!
                                 Sol Re Do
Don't tell me there's no hope at all
  Sim             Lam
Together we stand,
           Mim9
Divided we fall
