Doadd9                                Famaj7   Sol6
Where were you when I was burned and broken
          Lam            Sol             Fa
While the days slipped by from my window watching
    Do                                       Famaj7    Sol6
And where were you when I was hurt and I was helpless
            Lam                    Sol              Fa
Because the things you say and the things you do surround me
          Lam                      Fa
While you were hanging yourself on someone else's words
Lam                        La#add9
Dying to believe in what you heard
      Lam              Sol4     Sol     Doadd9
I was staring straight into the shining sun

Doadd9              Fa
Lost in thought and lost in time
          Lam                   Sol                  Faadd9
While the seeds of life and the seeds of change were planted
   Doadd9             Fa
Outside the rain fell dark and slow
        Lam              Sol                        Faadd9
While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime
         Lam                       Fa
I took a heavenly ride through our silence
           Lam            La#add9
I knew the moment had arrived
    Lam                  Sol4   Sol     Doadd9
For killing the past and coming back to life

Doadd9   Fa   Lam  Sol  Faadd9

Doadd9   Fa   Lam  Sol  Faadd9

         Lam                       Fa
I took a heavenly ride through our silence
           Lam           La#add9
I knew the waiting had begun
    Lam                Sol4     Sol   Doadd9
And headed straight... into the shining sun

Doadd9   Fa   Lam  Sol  Faadd9

Doadd9   Fa   Lam  Sol  Faadd9

Lam  Fa  Lam  La#add9  Lam  Sol4 Sol Doadd9
