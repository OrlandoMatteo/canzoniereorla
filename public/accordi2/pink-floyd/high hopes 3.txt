Dom           Dom7         Sol#/Do
 Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
Dom            Dom7            Sol#/Do
 In a world of magnets and miracles
Dom                   Dom7              Sol#/Do
 Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
    Dom            Dom7                Sol#/Do
The ringing of the division bell had begun
Sol#/Do     La#/Sol#       Sol4        Sol
 Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Sol#/Do         La#/Sol#           Sol4  Sol
 Do they still meet there by the Cut

Dom          Dom7             Sol#/Do
 There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Dom                Dom7              Sol#/Do
Running before time took our dreams away
Dom          Dom7                   Sol#/Do
 Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
Dom           Dom7            Sol#/Do
 To a life consumed by slow decay

              Dom     Solm  Sol#add9 La#
The grass was greener
              Dom     Re#  Fam  Sol#
The light was brighter
                Dom     Solm  Sol#add9 La#
With friends surrounded
              Dom    Re#  Fam  Sol
The nights of wonder

Dom                 Dom7      Sol#/Do
 Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
Dom              Dom7                    Sol#/Do
 To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Dom          Dom7         Sol#/Do
 Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dom             Dom7                Sol#/Do
 Dragged by the force of some inner tide
Sol#/Do       La#/Sol#       Sol4          Sol
 At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
Sol#/Do          La#/Sol#               Sol4        Sol
 We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Mim     Fa     Mim     Fa

Dom Re# Sol#    Dom Re# Sol#

Dom    Dom7  Sol#/Do
 Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
Dom      Dom7  Sol#/Do
 There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Dom        Dom7     Sol#/Do
 Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
       Dom       Dom7     Sol#/Do
Though down this road we've been so many times

              Dom     Solm  Sol#add9 La#
The grass was greener
              Dom     Re#  Fam  Sol#
The light was brighter
                Dom     Solm  Sol#add9 La#
With friends surrounded
              Dom    Re#  Fam  Sol
The nights of wonder
                Dom     Solm  Sol#add9  La#
With friends surrounded
              Dom     Re#  Fam  Sol#
The dawn mist glowing
          Dom    Solm  Sol#add9  La#
The water flowing
            Dom   Re#  Fam  Sol#
The endless river
            Dom  Solm  Sol#add9  La#
Forever and ever
