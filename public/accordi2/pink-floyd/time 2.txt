Fa#m                                    La
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day;
Mi                                         Fa#m
fritter and waste the hours in an off hand way;
                                            La
Kicking around on a piece of groundin' your hometown;
Mi                                               Fa#m
waiting for someone or something to show you the way...
Remaj7                            Lamaj7
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain,
Remaj7                                Lamaj7
you are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today.
Remaj7                        Do#m7
  And then one day,you find   ten years have got behind you.
Mim7                          Mi
No one told you when to run....You missed the starting gun.

Fa#m                                               La
Run and you run to catch up with the Sun, but it's sinking;
Mi                                   Fa#m
racing around to come up behind you again.
                                                  La
The Sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older,
Mi                                       Fa#m
shorter of breath, and one day closer to death.
Remaj7                           Lamaj7
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time.
Remaj7                                 Lamaj7
Plans that either come to naught, or half a page of scribbled lines.
Remaj7                     Do#m7
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way.

    Sim
The time is gone. The song is over.
Sim7                  Do
Thought I'd something more to say.

Mim           La
  Home, home again
Mim                        La
  I like to be here when I can
Mim                         La
  When I come home cold and tired
     Mim                              La
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Do
Far away, across the field
    Sim
The tolling of the iron bell
Fam
Calls the faithful to their knees
   Sol             Re     Re#   Mim
To hear the softly spoken magic spell
