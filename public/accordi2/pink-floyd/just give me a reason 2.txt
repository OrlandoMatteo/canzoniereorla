        Sol/Si  Lam/Do

Sol
 Right from the start
            Do
You were a thief
             Mim
You stole my heart
    Do               Sol
And I your willing victim

I let you see the parts of me
     Do                  Mim
That weren't all that pretty
         Do                 Sol
And with every touch you fixed them

    Mim            Re   La/Do#  Re
Now you've been talking in your sleep, oh, oh
Mim          Re  La/Do# Re
Things you never say to me, oh, oh
Mim          Re     La/Do# Re
Tell me that you've had   enough
Sol/Si Do    Sol/Si Re4   Re
Of our love, our    love

Sol
Just give me a reason
       Re/Fa#
Just a little bit's enough
       Mim                 Re  Do   Sim
Just a second we're not broken just bent
           Do/Re          Sol
And we can learn to love again

It's in the stars
          Re/Fa#                       Mim
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
             Re  Do    Sim
We're not broken just bent
           Do/Re          Sol
And we can learn to love again

    Sol
I'm sorry I don't understand
      Do                 Mim
Where all of this is coming from
  Do                    Sol
I thought that we were fine

(Oh, we had everything)

Your head is running wild again
   Do                 Mim
My dear we still have everythin'
    Do               Sol
And it's all in your mind

(Yeah, but this is happenin')
Mim           Re   La/Do#   Re
You've been havin' real bad dreams, oh, oh
Mim             Re La/Do#   Re
You used to lie so close to me, oh, oh
        Mim          Re   La/Do# Re
There's nothing more than empty  sheets
   Sol/Si   Do    Sol/Si Lam
Between our love, our    love

Oh, our love, our love

         Re    Do  Sim
Oh, tear ducts and rust
                Do
I'll fix it for us
                 Re
We're collecting dust
                 Mim
But our love's enough
          Re   Do Sim
You're holding it in
                 Do
You're pouring a drink
                 Lam7   Re4 Re
No nothing is as bad as it seems

We'll come clean
