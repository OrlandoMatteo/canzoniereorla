 Remember when you were young,
Fa#                 La#
  You shone like the sun
Re#   Solm/Re  Dom7  Re#/La#  Fa       Re/Fa#
Shine on you,  crazy          diamond
Solm
Now there's a look in your eyes,
Fa#                      La#
  Like black holes in the sky
Re#   Solm/Re  Dom7  Re#/La#  Fa
Shine on you,  crazy          diamond

    Re/Fa# Solm
You were   caught in the crossfire
   Fa#6
Of childhood and stardom,
La#/Fa             Do9
Blown on the steel breeze
Re#                    Midim
Come on you target for faraway laughter,
La#                       Rem         Re7/Fa#     Solm
Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine

     Solm  Fa#  La#  Re#  Solm/Re  Dom7  Re#/La#  Fa

    Solm
You reached for the secret too soon,
Fa#                La#
  You cried for the moon
Re#   Solm/Re  Dom7  Re#/La#  Fa
Shine on you,  crazy          diamond
Solm
Threatened by shadows at night,
Fa#                 La#
  And exposed in the light
Re#   Solm/Re  Dom7  Re#/La#  Fa
Shine on you,  crazy          diamond

         Solm
Well you wore out your welcome
     Fa#6
With well worn precision,
La#/Fa             Do9
Blown on the steel breeze
Re#                    Midim
Come on you raver, you seer of visions,
La#/Fa                   Rem        Re7/Fa#      Solm
Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner and shine
