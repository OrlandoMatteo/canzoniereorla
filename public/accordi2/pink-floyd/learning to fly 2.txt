       Mim   Re

Sol             La/Sol Sol
 Into the distance   a ribbon of black
Mim                                        Re
 Stretched to the point of no turning back
Sol              La/Sol Sol
 A flight of fancy on a windswept field
Mim                             Re
Standing alone my senses reeled
Sol              La/Sol Sol
 A fatal attraction  is holding me fast
    Mim                                   Re
How can I escape this irresistible grasp?
Do                  Sol/Si   Lam            Sol
 Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Fa                              Do          Re
Tongue tied and twisted just an earth bound misfit, I

Sol   La/Sol Sol    Mim  Re

Sol            La/Sol  Sol
 Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Mim                                               Re
 Unheeded warnings I thought I thought of everything
Sol         La/Sol Sol
 No navigator   to find my way home
Mim
 Unladened, empty and turned to stone
Do               Sol/Si   Lam             Sol
 A soul in tension that's learning to fly
Fa                      Do
 Condition grounded but determined to try
                   Sol/Si   Lam             Sol
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Fa                              Do          Re
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I

Famaj9             Lam  Re

Sol
 Above the planet on a wing and a prayer,
Mim
 My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air,
Sol
 Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Mim
 Out of the corner of my watering eye
Sol
 A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Mim
 Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night
Do                    Sol/Si Lam            Sol
 There's no sensation to compare with this
  Fa                   Do
Suspended animation, a state of bliss
                   Sol/Si   Lam             Sol
Can't keep my mind from the circling skies
Fa              Do/Mi   Rem     Do          Re
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I
