[<pre>Fa#m                                    
Ticking away the moments that make up a 
La
dull day
Mi                                        
Fritter and waste the hours in an 
        Fa#m
offhand way
Fa#m                                     
Kicking around on a piece of ground 
        La
in your hometown
Mi                                  
Waiting for someone or something to 
             Fa#m
show you the way


Remaj7                          
Tired of lying in the sunshine, 
 Lamaj7
staying home to watch the rain
Remaj7                          
You are young and life is long, 
     Lamaj7
and there is time to kill today
Remaj7                         
     And then one day you find,   
Do#m7
ten years have got behind you
Sim7                         
No one told you when to run ... 
Mi
You missed the starting gun


Fa#m    La    Mi    Fa#m    x4

Remaj7  Lamaj7  Remaj7  Lamaj7  

Remaj7  Do#m7   Sim7    Mi


         Fa#m                                              
And you run and you run to catch up 
            La
with the Sun, but it's sinking;
Mi                                   Fa#m
Racing around to come up behind you again.
    Fa#m                                  
The Sun is the same in a relative way, 
             La
but you're older,
Mi                                    
shorter of breath, 
                     Fa#m
and one day closer to death.

Remaj7                        
Every year is getting shorter,
 Lamaj7
never seem to find the time.
Remaj7                           
Plans that either come to naught,
Lamaj7
or half a page of scribbled lines.
Remaj7                     Do#m7
Hanging on in quiet desperation 
is the English way.
    Sim7                            
The time is gone, the song is over. 
Sim7                   Fa/Si
Thought I'd something more to say.

Mim    La    Mim    La


Mim7           La
 Home, home again
Mim7                      La
I like to be here when I can
Mim7                         La
 When I come home, cold and tired
Mim7                                  La
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Domaj7
Far away, across the field
Sim
Tolling on the iron bell
Famaj7
Calls the faithful to their knees
Sol                  Rem7          Sim
To hear the softly spoken magic spell</pre>]
