Doadd9      Re
 We were on fire
               Doadd9
I slashed your tires
          Mim7         Re                Doadd9
It's like we burned so bright, we burned out
           Re
I made you chase me
              Doadd9
I wasn't that friendly
  Mim7      Re                 Doadd9   Re
My love, my drug, we're fucked up, oh
       Sol
'Cause I've been on the run so long, they can't find me
Re/Fa#
 You waken up to remember I'm pretty
Do
 And when the chemicals leave my body
Re
Yeah, they're gonna find me in a hotel lobby

'Cause
Sol                       Re/Fa#
  Times they keep coming, all night

Laughing and fucking
Do
 Some days I can barely breathe
Re
After we were high on the love
                   Sol
Don't doubt it was you
                Re/Fa#
The pill I keep taking
         Sim      Do
The nightmare I'm waking
                    Re4      Re          Sol
There's nothing, no nothing, nothing but you
                Re/Fa#
My perfect rock bottom
       Sim   Do
My beautiful trauma
Re4      Re                Sol
My love, my love, my drug, oh
            Re/Fa#         Sim      Do
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
            Re                      Sol
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh

My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
         Re                             Sol
My love, my love, my drug, we're fucked up

              Re                     Doadd9
You punched a hole in the wall and I framed it
  Mim7         Re               Doadd9
I wish I could feel things like you
           Re                Doadd9
Everyone's chasing that holy feeling
       Mim7          Re             Doadd9
And if we don't stay lit we'll blow out
     Re
Blow out
Sol
'Cause we've been on the run so long they can't find us
Re/Fa#
 Who's gonna have to die to remind us
Do
 That it feels like we chose this blindly
Re
Now I'm gonna fuck up a hotel lobby

'Cause
Sol                      Re/Fa#
 Times they keep coming, last night

I might've messed it up again
Do
 Some days I can barely breathe
    Re
But after we were high on the love
                   Sol
Don't doubt it was you

My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
