Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain you are receding
Re                             La
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
Sol/Si Do                             Sol
   You are only coming through in waves
Sol/Si Do                                       Sol
   Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
     Re                     La
When I was a child I had a fever
   Re                           La
My hands felt just like two balloons
Sol/Si Do                             Sol
  Now I've got that feeling once again, I can't explain,
          Sol/Si Do                             Sol
You would not understand, This is not how I am

La   Sol/Si  Do9         Sol                Re
I            have become comfortably numb.


La  Re  La  Do  Sol  Do  Sol
La   Sol/Si Do        Sol                Re
I         have become comfortably numb.

O.K.
              La
Just a little pinprick
                    Sol    Mim

            Sim
But you may feel a little sick
Sisus2         Sim
Can you stand up?
                  La
I do believe it's working, good
                 Sol                  Mim

When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
Re                       La
Out of the corner of my eye
Sol/Si Do                           Sol
    I turned to look but it was gone
                   Sol/Si Do
I cannot put my finger on it now
                        Sol
The child is grown, The dream is gone
