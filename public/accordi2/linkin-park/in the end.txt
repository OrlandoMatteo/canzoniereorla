It starts with One thing I don't know why
        Re
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
        Do
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
        Re
To explain in due time
        Mim
All I know Time is a valuable thing
        Re
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
        Do
Watch it count down to the end of the day
        Re
The clock ticks life away
          Mim
It's so unreal Didn't look out below
        Re
Watch the time go right out the window
        Do
Trying to hold on but didn't even know
        Re
Wasted it all just to
                Mim
Watch you go I kept everything inside 
                Re
And even though I tried it all fell apart
                Do
What it meant to me will eventually 
            Re
Be a memory of a time when


           Mim              Sol               Re                    Do
I tried so hard And got so far But in the end It doesn't even matter
           Mim              Sol               Re                    Do
I had to fall To lose it all But in the end It doesn't even matter

     Re
To remind myself how
           Mim
I tried so hard In spite of the way you were mocking me
Re
Acting like I was part of your property
  Do
Remembering all the times you've fought with me
        Re                Mim
I'm surprised it got so (far)
Mim
Things aren't the way they were before
Re
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Do
Not that you knew me back then
       Re
But it all comes back to me
        Mim
(In the end)
You kept everything inside 
    Re
And even though I tried it all fell apart

I put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go
             Mim               Re                       Do   Re
And for all this There's only one thing you should know
