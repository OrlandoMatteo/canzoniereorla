        Do#m    Lamaj7 Si Do#m Mi6

Do#            La
Crawling in my skin
      Mi                   Si    Sol#5
These wounds they will not heal
Do#           La
Fear is how I fall
   Mi             Si   Sol#5 Do#m  Lamaj7  Mi  Si
Confusing what is real

Do#m
 There's something inside me
     Lamaj7
that pulls beneath the surface
Mi        Si
 Consuming confusing
Do#m                         Lamaj7
 This lack of self-control I fear is never ending
Mi          Si              Lamaj7
 Controlling  I can't seem
                Si
To find myself again
                     Do#m
My walls are closing in

without a sense of confidence
        Mi
and I'm convinced that there's
                          Lamaj7
just too much pressure to take
                     Si
I've felt this way before
       Do#m   Mi
So insecure

Do#            La
Crawling in my skin
      Mi                   Si    Sol#5
These wounds they will not heal
Do#           La
Fear is how I fall
   Mi             Si   Sol#5
Confusing what is real

Do#m                      Lamaj7
 Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Mi          Si
 Distracting  reacting
Do#m                       Lamaj7
 Against my will I stand beside my own reflection
Mi            Si
 It's haunting  how I can't seem
Lamaj7             Si
 To find myself again
                     Do#m
My walls are closing in

without a sense of confidence
        Mi
and I'm convinced that there's just
                     Lamaj7
too much pressure to take
                     Si

   Mi        Si        Sol#5 Do#
Confusing confusing what is  real

                                 La
There's something inside me that pulls
                       Mi
beneath the surface...
    Si        Sol#5 Do#
 Confusing what is  real

This lack of self-control
  La                  Mi
I fear is never ending  controlling
   Si                   Sol#5
Confusing what is real
