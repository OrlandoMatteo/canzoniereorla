        Solm  La#  Fa  Do5  Solm  La#  Fa  Do5

        Solm  La#  Fa  Do5  Solm  La#  Fa  Do5  Solm

            Solm
In this farewell
            La#
There's no blood
            Fa   Dom
There's no alibi
                    Solm
'Cause I've drawn regret
          La#
From the truth
        Fa         Dom
Of a thousand lies
             Re#            Fa
So let mercy come and wash away

          Solm
What I've done
     La#         Fa
I'll face myself
                  Do5    Solm
To cross out what I've become
 La#         Fa
Erase myself  and let go of
Do5       Solm
What I've done

        La#
Put to rest
            Fa         Dom
What you thought of me
                   Solm
While I clean this slate
          La#
With the hands
       Fa      Dom
Of uncertainty
             Re#            Fa
So let mercy come and wash away

          Solm
What I've done
     La#         Fa
I'll face myself
                  Do5    Solm
To cross out what I've become
 La#         Fa
Erase myself  and let go of
Do5       Solm
What I've done
Dom Rem Re# Fa Solm  La#  Fa  Do5
What    I've   done

Solm  La#  Fa  Do5 Rem

    Re#  Fa   Solm
For what I've done
     La#         Fa
I'll start again
             Do5       Solm
And whatever thing may come
  La#           Fa
Today this ends  I'm forgiving
Do5       Solm
What I've done

     La#         Fa
I'll face myself
                  Do5    Solm
To cross out what I've become
La#         Fa
Erase myself and let go of
Do5       Solm  La#  Fa
What I've done
Dom       Solm  La#  Fa
What I've done
          Dom       Solm
Forgiving what I've done
