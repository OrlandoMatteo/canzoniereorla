  Mim                          Do
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
   Sol                       Re
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface
  Mim                       Do
Don't know what you're expecting of me
   Sol                        Re              Do      Re
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
       Mim               Sol                Do        Re
Every step I take is another mistake to you

(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)


Mim             Do                      Sol
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
               Re                    Mim
I've become so tired, so much more aware
             Do                   Sol
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
                Re                   Mim
Is be more like me and be less like you

                               Do
Can't you see that you're smothering me
    Sol                  Re             Mim
Holding too tightly afraid to lose control
                             Do
Cause everything that you thought I would be
       Sol           Re                Do        Re
Has fallen apart right in front of you

(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
       Mim                    Sol               Do        Re
Every step that I take is another mistake to you

(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
             Mim                       Sol       Re
And every second I waste is more than I can take

Mim             Do                      Sol
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
               Re                    Mim
I've become so tired, so much more aware
             Do                   Sol
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
                Re                   Do
Is be more like me and be less like you


        Re
And I know
      Mim Re/Fa# Sol Sim7   Do
I may end up failing too
        Re
But I know
          Si                        Si4
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you


Mim             Do                      Sol
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
