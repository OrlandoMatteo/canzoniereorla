Do#m
Take me down to the river bend

Take me down to the fighting end
Si
Wash the poison from off my skin
Do#m
Show me how to be whole again

Fly me up on a silver wing

Past the black where the sirens sing
Si
Warm me up in a nova's glow
    Do#m
And drop me down to the dream below

           La     Mi            Si        Do#m
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
       La       Mi               Si
Hardly anything there for you to see
           Do#m  Si Fa#5  Do#m  Si Fa#5
For you to see

Do#m
Bring me home in a blinding dream,

Through the secrets that I have seen
Si
Wash the sorrow from off my skin
    Do#m
And show me how to be whole again

           La     Mi            Si        Do#m
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
       La       Mi               Si
Hardly anything there for you to see
           Lamaj7  Mi  Si  Fa#5  Do#m
For you to see

La  Mi  Si  Fa#5  Do#m

           La     Mi            Si        Do#m
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass

Hardly anything else I need to be--e
