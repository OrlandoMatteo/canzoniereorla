You told me yes   You held me high

And I believed when you told that lie
              Do
I played that soldier   You played king
              Sol
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
              Rem
You lost that right   to hold that crown
            Lam
I built you up but you let me down
            Do
so when you fall  I'll take my turn
