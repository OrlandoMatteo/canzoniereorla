        Fam  Sol#  Re#  La#5

    Fam
I remembered black skies
    Sol#            Re#      La#5
The lightning all around me
    Fam
I remembered each flash
   Sol#           Re#   La#5
As time began to blur
       Fam
Like a startling sign
     Sol#              Re#      La#5
That fate had finally found me
         Do#maj7
And your voice was all I heard
       La#5
That I get what I deserve

           Fam
So give me reason

To prove me wrong
   Re#              La#5
To wash this memory clean
        Fam
Let the floods cross
    Sol#              Re#
The distance in your eyes
        Fam
Give me reason
   Sol#
To fill this hole
   Re#               La#5
Connect the space between
       Do#                               Re#
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
                  Fam  Sol#  Re#  La#5
Across this new divide

          Fam
There was nothing in sight
    Sol#            Re#       La#5
But memories left abandoned
          Fam
There was nowhere to hide
    Sol#             Re#   La#5
The ashes fell like snow
        Fam
And the ground caved in
  Sol#                 Re#      La#5
Between where we were standing
         Do#maj7
And your voice was all I heard
       La#5
That I get what I deserve

           Fam
So give me reason

To prove me wrong
   Re#               La#5
To wash this memory clean
        Fam
Let the floods cross
    Sol#              Re#
The distance in your eyes
                  Fam
Across this new divide

         Fam           Sol#
In every loss in every lie
         Re#                La#5
In every truth that you'd deny
            Fa               Sol#
And each regret and each goodbye
        Re#                La#5
Was a mistake too great to hide
         Do#maj7
And your voice was all I heard
       La#5
That I get what I deserve
   Do      Fam
So give me reason

To prove me wrong
   Re#              La#5
To wash this memory clean
        Fam
Let the floods cross
    Sol#              Re#
The distance in your eyes
        Fam
Give me reason

To fill this hole
  Re#                La#5
Connect the space between
       Do#                               Re#
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
                  Fam   Sol#  Re#
Across this new divide
 La#5             Fam   Sol#  Re#
