  Do#m                            Mi
I am a little bit of loneliness a little bit of disregard
                    La
Handful of complaints but
                               Si
I can't help the fact that everyone can see these scars
  Do#m                            Mi
I am what I want you to want what I want you to feel
                 La
But it's like no matter what I do,
                         Si
I can't convince you, to just believe this is real
   Do#m                    Mi
So I let go, watching you, turn your back like you always do
La
Face away and pretend that I'm not
    Si
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got

Do#5       Mi5
I can't feel the way I did before
La5
 Don't turn your back on me
Fa#5    Sol#5
I won't be ignored
Do#5           Mi5
Time won't heal this damage anymore
La5
 Don't turn your back on me
Fa#5    Sol#5   Mi5
I won't be ignored

  Do#m                       Mi
I am a little bit insecure a little unconfident
                 La
'Cause you don't understand
                        Si
I do what I can but sometimes I don't make sense
  Do#m
I am what you never wanna say
    Mi
but I've never had a doubt
             La
It's like no matter what I do
                         Si
I can't convince you for once just to hear me out
   Do#m                  Mi
So I let go watching you turn your back like you always do
La
Face away and pretend that I'm not
Si
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

Do#5       Mi5
I can't feel the way I did before
La5
 Don't turn your back on me
Fa#5    Sol#5
I won't be ignored
Do#5           Mi5
Time won't heal this damage anymore
La5
 Don't turn your back on me
Fa#5    Sol#5   Mi5
I won't be ignored

Do#5
No     Hear me out now

You're gonna listen to me, like it or not

Right now    Hear me out now

You're gonna listen to me, like it or not

Right now
Do#m
I can't feel the way I did before

Don't turn your back on me

I won't be ignored

Do#5       Mi5
I can't feel the way I did before
La5
 Don't turn your back on me

I won't be ignored
Do#5           Mi5
Time won't heal this damage anymore
La5
 Don't turn your back on me

Do#5       Mi5
I can't feel..
La5
 Don't turn your back on me
