     Re#m    Si    Sol#m    Fa# Fa#/Fa

    Re#m          Si                    Sol#m
I'm sorry for the times that I made you scream
        Fa#          Fa#/Fa      Re#m
For the times that I killed your dreams
        Si                     Sol#m          Fa#  Fa#/Fa
For the times that I made your whole world rumble
Re#m      Si                    Sol#m
  For the times that I made you cry
        Fa#          Fa#/Fa   Re#m
For the times that I told you lies
        Si                       Mi
For the times that I watched and let you stumble

         Re#m  Si          Sol#m  Fa#  Fa#/Fa
It's too bad,   but that's me
           Re#m         Si            Sol#m  Fa#  Fa#/Fa
What goes around comes around, you'll see
           Sol#m  Do#  Fa#       Si
That I can carry   the burden of pain
                    Sol#m     Do#      Fa#        Si
'Cause it ain't the first time  that a man goes insane
                  Sol#m   Do#    Fa#           Si
And when I spread my wings  to embrace him for life
                    Sol#m                Do#      Fa#      Si
I'm suckin' out his love, 'cause I, I'll never be nobody's wife


     Re#m    Si    Sol#m    Fa# Fa#/Fa

    Re#m          Si                       Sol#m
I'm sorry for the times that I didn't come home
         Fa#           Fa#/Fa  Re#m
Left you lyin' in that bed    alone
           Si                       Sol#m          Fa#  Fa#/Fa
Was flyin' high in the sky when you needed my shoulder
Re#m            Si                     Sol#
  You're like a stone hangin' round my neck, see
       Fa#             Fa#/Fa    Re#m
Cut it loose before it breaks my back, see
           Si                     Sol#m    Fa#  Fa#/Fa
I've gotta say what I feel before I grow older
    Re#m        Si                    Sol#m
I'm sorry but I ain't gonna change my ways
              Fa#           Fa#/Fa    Re#m
You know I've tried but I'm still the same
     Si           Mi
I've got to do it my own way

         Re#m  Si          Sol#m  Fa#  Fa#/Fa
It's too bad,   but that's me
           Re#m         Si            Sol#m  Fa#  Fa#/Fa
What goes around comes around, you'll see
           Sol#m  Do#  Fa#       Si
That I can carry   the burden of pain
                    Sol#m     Do#      Fa#        Si
'Cause it ain't the first time  that a man goes insane
                  Sol#m   Do#    Fa#           Si
And when I spread my wings  to embrace him for life
                    Sol#m                Do#      Fa#      Si
I'm suckin' out his love, 'cause I, I'll never be nobody's wife

I'm suckin' out his love, 'cause I, I'll never be nobody's wife.
