       Sol  Re/Fa#  Doadd9  Re/Fa#

Sol
 If roses are meant to be red
Re/Fa#
 And violets to be blue
Doadd9              Re/Fa#
 Why isn't my heart   meant for you
Sol
 My hands are longing to touch you
Re/Fa#
 But I can barely breathe
Doadd9
 Starry eyes that make me melt
Re/Fa#
Right in front of me

Sol
Lost in this world
           Re/Fa#
I even get lost in this song
             Do
And when the lights go down
              Re
That is where I'll be found

Sol
 This music's irresistible
    Re/Fa#
Your voice makes my skin crawl
Do
 Innocent and pure
Re/Fa#
 I guess you heard it all before
Sol
 Mister Inaccessible
Re/Fa#
Will this ever change
Do
 One thing that remains the same
     Re/Fa#
You're still a picture in a frame

Sol
Lost in this world
           Re/Fa#       Re
I even get lost in this song
             Do
And when the lights go down
              Re
That is where I'll be found
      Sol
I get lost in this world
      Re/Fa#       Re
I get lost in your eyes
             Do            Lam7
And when the lights go down
             Re
That's where I'll be found
     Do    Re    Lam7    Re
Yeah yeah

Sol
Lost in this world
      Re/Fa#
I get lost in your eyes
             Do
And when the lights go down
          Re
Am I the only one
        Sol  Re/Fa# Re  Do Lam7  Re
Ooh...

Sol  Re/Fa# Re  Do  Re
