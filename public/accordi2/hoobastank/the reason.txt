Mi                     Do#m
    I'm not a perfect person
                                      Mi
There are many things I wish I didn't do
                 Do#m
But I continue learning
                                    Laadd9
I never meant to do those things to you
                              Siadd11
And so I have to say before I go
                        Mi5
That I just want you to know


                        Do#m
I've found a reason for me
                        Laadd9
To change who I used to be
                       Siadd11
A reason to start over new
                  Mi
And the reason is you


                      Do#m
I'm sorry that I hurt you
                                     Mi
It's something I must live with everyday
                           Do#m
And all the pain I put you through
                                Laadd9
I wish that I could take it all away
                                    Siadd11
And be the one who catches all your tears
                         Mi5
Thats why I need you to hear


                        Do#m
I've found a reason for me
                        Laadd9
To change who I used to be
                       Siadd11
A reason to start over new
                  Resus2
And the reason is you


                  Mi5
And the reason is you
                  Resus2
And the reason is you
                  Mi5
And the reason is you


Mi                       Do#m
     I'm not a perfect person

And the reason is you
                       Do#m
I've found a reason to show
                        Laadd9
A side of me you didn't know
                        Siadd11
A reason for all that I do
                  Mi
And the reason is you</pre>]
