And sacrifice my everything for just a second's worth
                  Mi       Fa#m
Of how my story's ending
                                                 Re
And I wish I could know if the directions that I take

And all the choices that I make won't end up all for nothing

I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer
Fa#m                Mi  Fa#m
 Is there something more

To navigate the darkness
                Mi Fa#m                 Re
Will the ending be   ever coming suddenly?

Will I ever get to see the ending to my story?

 How much further do I have to go?
