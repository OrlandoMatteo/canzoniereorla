[<pre>Do       Lam             Fa
Oceans apart day after day
        Sol       Do
And I slowly go insane
Do       Lam             Fa
I hear your voice on the line
        Sol            Lam
But it doesn't stop the pain


Lam             Fa
If I see you next to never
Lam               Fa             Do
How can we say forever


Do               Sol
Wherever you go
Sol              Lam
Whatever you do
Lam         Fa                Do
I will be right here waiting for you
Do               Sol
Whatever it takes
Sol               Lam
Or how my heart breaks
Lam         Fa                Do
I will be right here waiting for you


Do       Lam             Fa
I took for granted, all the times
        Sol                Do
That I thought would last somehow
Do        Lam               Fa
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
Sol                       Lam
But I can't get near you now


Lam              Fa
Oh, can't you see it baby
Lam              Fa      Do
You've got me goin' crazy


Do               Sol
Wherever you go
Sol              Lam
Whatever you do
Lam         Fa                Do
I will be right here waiting for you
Do               Sol
Whatever it takes
Sol               Lam
Or how my heart breaks
Lam         Fa                Do
I will be right here waiting for you


Rem7     Do         Fa
I wonder how we can survive
Fa
This romance
Rem7     Do             Fa
But in the end if I'm with you
Fa           Sol
I'll take the chance

Lam              Fa
Oh, can't you see it baby
Lam              Fa      Do
You've got me goin' crazy


Do               Sol
Wherever you go
Sol              Lam
Whatever you do
Lam         Fa                Do
I will be right here waiting for you
Do               Sol
Whatever it takes
Sol               Lam
Or how my heart breaks
Lam         Fa                Do
I will be right here waiting for you</pre>]
