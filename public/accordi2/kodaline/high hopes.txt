[<pre>Do        Do/Si           Lam     
  Broken bottles in the hotel lobby
Fa          Do                Mi7              Lam      Sol   Fa
  Seems to me like I'm just scared of never feeling it again
    Do        Mi7         Lam       Sol      Fa
I know it's crazy to believe in silly things
                Sol
It's not that easy


Do              Do/Si                Lam     
  I remember it now, it takes me back to when it all first started
Fa             Do            Mi7                Lam   Sol       Fa
  But I only got myself to blame for it, and I accept that now
      Do      Mi7            Lam      Sol      Fa
It's time to let it go, go out and start again
                   Sol
But it's not that easy

[Chorus 1]
But I've got        
Fa      Do          Sol                Lam      Sol   
 high hopes, it takes me back to when we started
Fa      Do              Mi7              Lam      Sol 
 High hopes, when you   let it go, go out and start again
Fa     Do      Mi7        Lam       Sol       Fa
 High hopes,   when it all comes to an end
                     Sol          ( Do )
But the world keeps spinning around


Do/Si    Lam 
Fa       Do      Mi7      Lam  Sol 
Fa       Sol


Do           Do/Si                Lam     
  And in my dreams, I meet the ghosts of all the people who've come and gone
Fa         Do                   Mi7                   Lam        Sol       Fa
  Memories, they seem to show up so quick but they leave you far too soon
    Do             Mi7             Lam     Sol      Fa
Naive, I was just staring at the barrel of the gun
            Sol
And I do believe that


But I've got        
Fa      Do          Sol                Lam      Sol   
 high hopes, it takes me back to when we started
Fa      Do              Mi7              Lam      Sol 
 High hopes, when you   let it go, go out and start again
Fa    Do       Mi7        Lam       Sol       Fa
 High hopes,  oh when it all comes to an end
                     Sol      
And the world keeps spinning 
Fa                      Sol           ( Do ) 
  yeah the world keeps spinning around

Fa       Sol


Fa      Do          Sol                Lam      Sol   
 High hopes, it takes me back to when we started
Fa      Do              Mi7              Lam      Sol 
 High hopes, when you   let it go, go out and start again
Fa      Do           Mi7    Lam  Sol 
 High hopes, ooohhh
Fa                      Sol
  And the world keeps spinning
Fa                       Sol
  Yeah this world keeps spinning
Fa                      Sol
Fa                      Sol         Do
  How this world keeps  spinning around
