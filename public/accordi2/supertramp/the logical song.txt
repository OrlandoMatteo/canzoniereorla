When I was young,
               Sol#maj7       Solm7
It seemed that life was so wonderful,
  La#                Sol#        Lam7b5
A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical
            Dom
And all the birds in the trees,
               Sol#maj7      Solm7
Well they'd be singing so happily,
   La#          Sol#       Lam7b5
Oh joyfully, oh playfully watching me
              Dom
But then they sent me away
            Sol#maj7     Solm7
To teach me how to be sensible,
La#           Sol#       Lam7b5
Logical, oh responsible, practical
              Dom
And then they showed me a world
              Sol#maj7 Solm7
Where I could be so dependable,
   La#               Sol#      Lam7b5
Oh clinical, oh intellectual, cynical

There are times
                       Fa7/Re#
When all the world's asleep,
                      Sol#/Re#
The questions run too deep
                  Do#  Do#/Do  La#m7  La#m7/Sol#
For such a simple man
          Re#
Won't you please,
                          Fa7/Re#
Please tell me what we've learned
                  Sol#/Re#
I know it sounds absurd
                     Do#  Do#/Do  La#m7  Do#/Sol#
Please tell me who I am

I said now what would you say
          Sol#maj7         Solm7
Now we're calling you a radical,
  La#           Sol#      Lam7b5
A liberal, oh fanatical, criminal
             Dom
Oh won't you sign up your name,
             Sol#maj7         Solm7
We'd like to feel you're acceptable,
  La#              Sol#           Lam7b5
Respectable, oh presentable, a vegetable!
                 Dom  Sol# Solm7  La#  Sol# Lam7b5
Take, take, take it
