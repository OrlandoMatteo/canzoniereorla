       La Fa#m Sim7    La Fa#m Sim7 Do

               Fa
Wouldn't it be nice if we were older
                 La#             Solm
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
    Do             Fa
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
               La#              Solm  Do7
In the kind of world where we belong
Rem                          Re#/Fa
 You know it's gonna make it that much better
Rem                            Lam    Solm7   Do7
 When we can say goodnight and stay together

               Fa
Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
               La#             Solm
In the morning when the day is new
    Do7          Fa
And after having spent the day together
                La#                   Solm    Do7
Hold each other close the whole night through
Rem                   Re#/Fa
 Happy times together we've been spending
Rem                         Lam  Solm7  Do7
 I wish that every kiss was neverending
              Fa
Wouldn't it be nice

Remaj7         Solmaj7                               Fa#m7            Sim7
 Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true
Remaj7             Solmaj7                         Fa#m7       Sim7
 Baby then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
            Fa#m7                Sim7
We could be married (we could be married)
                 Fa#m7                   Do
And then we'd be happy (and then we'd be happy)

             Fa
Wouldn't it be nice

Rem                            Re#/Fa
 You know it seems the more we talk about it
Rem                        Lam    Solm7
 It only makes it worse to live without it
         Lam   Solm7    Do7
But lets talk about it
              Fa
Wouldn't it be nice

Good night my baby

Sleep tight my baby

Good night my baby

Sleep tight my baby

Good night my baby

Sleep tight my baby ...
