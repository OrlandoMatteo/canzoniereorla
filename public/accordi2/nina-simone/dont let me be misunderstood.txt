Sim             La
  Baby you understand me now
   Sol                        Fa#7
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Sim                              La
  Doncha know no one alive can always be an angel?
Sol                                   Fa#7
  When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

    Re                      Sim
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Sol        Fa#7                           Sim    Mim
  Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Sim                             La
  Ya know sometimes baby I'm so carefree
Sol                 Fa#7
  With a joy that's hard to hide
Sim                                            La
  And then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry
Sol                               Fa#7
  And then you're bound to see my other side

    Re                      Sim
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Sol        Fa#7                           Sim   La
  Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Sol         La
  If I seem edgy
  Sol         La
I want you to know
  Sol           La          Fa#  Re
I never mean to take it out on you
Sol          La
Life has its problems
    Sol             La
And I get more than my share
    Sol                              Fa#7
But that's one thing I never mean to do, 'cause I love you

Sim       La
  Oh... baby I'm just human
Sol                                 Fa#7
  Don't you know I have faults like anyone?

Sim                        La
  Sometimes I find myself alone regretting
                    Sol
Some little foolish thing
            Fa#7
Some simple thing that I've done

    Re                      Sim
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Sol        Fa#7                           Sim
  Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Sim
  Don't let me be misunderstood...
Sim
I try so hard,
   Sim
So please don't let me be misunderstood
