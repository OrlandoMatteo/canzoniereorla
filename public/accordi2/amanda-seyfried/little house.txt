Sol           Mim
I love this place
         Do       Re
But it's haunted without you
Sol        Mim
My tired heart
           Do  Re
Is beating so slow
Sol               Mim
Our hearts sing less
        Do
Than we wanted
   Re
We wanted
Sol               Mim
Our hearts sing 'cause
          Do
We do not know
          Re
we do not know



Do            Re
To light the night
           Sol
To help us grow
           Mim
To help us grow
Do         Re
It is not said
Sol
I always know



Sol Mim Sol Mim



Sol             Mim
You can catch me
          Do
Don't you run
          Re
Don't you run
Sol                Mim
If you live another day
        Do            Re
In this happy little house
                      Sol
The fire's here to stay



Do            Re
To light the night
           Sol
To help us grow
           Mim
To help us grow
Do         Re
It is not said
Sol
I always know



Mim           Do
Please don't make a fuss
Sol              Re
It won't go away
Mim         Do
The wonder of it all
    Sol             Re
The wonder that I made
                Do Re Do Re
I am here to stay
                Do Re
I am here to stay</pre>]
