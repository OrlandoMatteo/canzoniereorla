Sweet Lucy was a dancer
    Re
But none of us would chance her
  La                   Sol La
Because she was a Samurai
    Sim
She made electric shadows
  Re
Beyond our fingertips
    La                          Mi5
And none of us could reach that high
    Sim
She came on like a teaser
  Re
I had to touch and please her
  La                Sol La
Enjoy a little paradise
    Sim
The log was in my pocket
     Re
When Lucy met the Rockett
        La                    Sim La Sol
And she never knew the reason why----
        Mi5
I can't deny it
          Re    La/Do# Sim La
With that smile on     her face
Sol            Mi5
  It's not the kill
         Re     La/Do# La
It's the thrill of the chase

Sim                Sol La
    Feel it coming
     Sim
It's knocking at the door
                             Sol La
You know it's no good running
     Sim
It's not against the law
Sim                   Sol La
    The point of no return
    Sim
And now you know the score
                       Sol  La
And now you're learning
       Mi5
What's knockin' at your back door

Sweet Nancy was so fancy
   Re
To get into her pantry
       La              Sol La
Had to be the aristocracy
    Sim
The members that she toyed with
   Re
At her city club
     La                  Mi5
Were something in diplomacy
      Sim
So we put her on the hit list
     Re
Of a common cunning linguist
  La             Sol  La
A master of many tongues
    Sim
And now she eases gently
         Re
From her Austin to her Bentley
La                    Sim La Sol
Suddenly she feels so young---
        Mi5
I can't deny it
          Re    La/Do# Sim La
With that smile on     her face
Sol            Mi5
  It's not the kill
         Re     La/Do# La
It's the thrill of the chase

Sim                Sol La
    Feel it coming
     Sim

     Sim
It's not against the law
Sim                   Sol La
    The point of no return
    Sim
And now you know the score
                       Sol  La
And now you're learning
       Mi5                        Fa#5
What's knockin' at your back door

Fa#5     La5 Re5
