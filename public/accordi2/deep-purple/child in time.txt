       Sol Lam   Sol Lam   Fa Sol   Lam

Sol Lam              Sol Lam
       Sweet Child in time
                Fa  Sol
 you'll see the line
                         Sol Lam
The line that's drawn between
                     Sol Lam
The good and the bad
              Sol Lam
See the blind man
         Fa      Sol
 Shooting at the world
          Sol Lam
Bullets flying
      Sol    Lam
 taking toll

                 Sol  Lam
If you've been bad,
                 Fa  Sol
Lord I bet you have
                    Sol  Lam
And you've not been hit
         Sol   Lam
by flying lead
                        Sol   Lam
You'd better close your eyes
       Fa     Sol
and bow your head

Sol Lam
       Wait for the ricochet

Sol Lam   Sol Lam   Fa Sol   Sol Lam

Sol Lam              Sol   Lam
       Sweet Child in time
             Fa    Sol
 you'll see the line
                   Sol       Lam
The line that's drawn between
               Sol Lam
The good and the bad
          Sol    Lam
See the blind man
      Fa        Sol
 Shooting at the world
        Sol    Lam
Bullets flying
        Sol    Lam
 taking toll
            Sol    Lam
If you've been bad,
                Fa   Sol
Lord I bet you have
                    Sol   Lam
And you've not been hit
        Sol   Lam
by flying lead
                    Sol    Lam
You'd better close your eyes
