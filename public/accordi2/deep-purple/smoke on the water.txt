   Sol5
We all came out to Montreux
              Fa5  Sol5
On the Lake Geneva shoreline

To make records with a mobile
   Fa5    Sol5
We didn't have much time

Frank Zappa and the Mothers
                 Fa5    Sol5
Were at the best place around

But some stupid with a flare gun
                 Fa5    Sol5
Burned the place to the ground

Do           Sol#   Sol5                Do           Sol#    Sol5
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky, smoke on the water

Sol5
 They burned down the gamblin' house,
                Fa5   Sol5
It died with an awful sound

and Funky Claude was running in and out
Fa5      Sol5
 Pulling kids out the ground

When it all was over
                Fa5      Sol5
We had to find another place

But Swiss time was running out
                        Fa5      Sol5
It seemed that we would lose the race

Do           Sol#   Sol5                Do           Sol#    Sol5
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky, smoke on the water

Sol5   Do5 Sol5    Do5 Sol5

Sol5   Do5 Sol5    Do5 Sol5

Do5    Fa5    Sol5

Sol5
 We ended up at the Grand Hotel
       Fa5   Sol5
It was empty cold and bare

But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Fa5         Sol5
 Making our music there

With a few red lights and a few old beds
          Fa5      Sol5
We make a place to sweat

No matter what we get out of this
       Fa5           Sol5
I know, I know we'll never forget

Do           Sol#   Sol5                Do           Sol#    Sol5
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky, smoke on the water
