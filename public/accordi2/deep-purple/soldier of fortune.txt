        Solm
I have often told you stories
Fa
About the way
   Solm
I lived the life of a drifter
Rem
  waiting for the day
          Solm
When I'd take your hand and sing you songs
      Fa
Then maybe you would say
Solm
Come lay with me and love me
Rem                     
  And I would surely stay


La#       Do                Solm   
  But I feel I'm growing older
Re#          Fa                La#
And the songs that I have sung
 Re            Solm
Echo in the distance
           Fa
Like the sound
      La#              Re#  
Of a windmill going round
Dom                Rem
Guess I'll always be
              Solm
A soldier of fortune.
   

Solm   Do   Solm   Do  
Solm   La#   Do   Solm


      Solm 
Many times I've been a traveller
    Fa
I looked for something new
            Solm   
In days of old when nights were cold
Rem
   I wandered without you
Solm
But those days I thought my eyes
Fa
Had seen you standing near
Solm
Though blindness is confusing
Rem  
It shows that you're not here.


La#       Do                Solm   
  But I feel I'm growing older
Re#          Fa                La#
And the songs that I have sung
 Re            Solm
Echo in the distance
           Fa
Like the sound
      La#              Re#  
Of a windmill going round
Dom                Rem
Guess I'll always be
              Solm
A soldier of fortune.

     Solm             Fa
Yes, I can hear the sound
       La#           Re#  
of a windmill going round
   Dom               Rem
I guess I'll always be
              Solm
a soldier of fortune.
   Re#               Rem7
I guess I'll always be
              Sol   
a soldier of fortune.</pre>]
