[<pre>Do         Sol                   Fa
Somebody said you got a new friend
Do         Sol                      Fa
Does she love you better than I can?
          Do           Sol          Fa
There's a big black sky over my town
Do             Sol                      Fa
I know where you're at, I bet she's around


Lam      Sol                 Fa
yeah, I know it's stupid
Fa                            Do
I just gotta see it for myself


Do          Sol                    Fa
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh..
Do              Sol                   Fa
I'm right over here, why can't you see me, oh..
Lam           Sol                       Fa
I'm giving it my all, but I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooohh..
Lam    Sol             Fa
I keep dancing on my own


Do              Sol              Fa
I'm just gonna dance all night
Do              Sol                     Fa
I'm all messed up, I'm so outta line


Lam           Sol             Fa
Stilettos and broken bottles,
Fa                             Do
I'm spinnin' around in circles


Do          Sol                    Fa
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh..

Fa       Sol                  Lam              Sol                  Fa
so far away but still so near (the lights go on, the music dies)
Fa              Sol               Lam             Sol                 Do
but you don't see me standing here (I just came to say goodbye)


                                           Do
I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh..
