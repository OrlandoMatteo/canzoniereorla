[<pre>Lam  Do  Sol  Rem


          Lam      Do
I let it fall, my heart,
           Sol                    Rem
And as it fell, you rose to claim it,
        Lam            Do
It was dark and I was over,
           Sol                     Rem
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me,
    Lam             Do              
My hands, they're strong, 
          Sol                Rem
but my knees were far too weak,
     Lam           Do
To stand in your arms 
          Sol               Sol
without falling to your feet,

               Fa                 Rem
But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew,
          Lam                          Lam
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true,
         Fa                            Sol
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win,


           Lam          Lam/Si  Lam
But I set fire to the rain,
            Sol                     Sol/La  Sol
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
           Rem
Well, it burned while I cried,
          Rem        Fa                Lam    Sol
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name,


      Lam       Do
When lay with you
          Sol           Rem 
I could stay there, close my eyes, 
          Lam     Do
feel you here forever,
        Sol                        Sol
You and me together, nothing is better,

[Refrain]
               Fa                 Rem
But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew,
          Lam                          Lam
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true,
         Fa                            Sol
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win,


           Lam         Lam/Si  Lam
But I set fire to the rain,
            Sol           Sol/La  Sol
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
           Rem
Well, it burned while I cried,
 Rem                Fa        Lam               Sol
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name,
       Lam         Lam/Si  Lam
I set fire to the rain,
            Sol           Sol/La  Sol
And I threw us into the flames,
         Rem
Well, I felt something die,
         Rem       Fa                 Lam             Sol
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time,


          Fa                Do/Mi
Sometimes I wake up by the door,
               Mim                        Sol
And heard you calling, must be waiting for you,
      Fa                     Do/Mi
Even now when we're already over,
         Mim                        Sol
I can't help myself from looking for you,


           Lam          Lam/Si  Lam
But I set fire to the rain,
            Sol           Sol/La  Sol
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
           Rem              
Well, it burned while I cried,
  Rem        Fa            Lam                  Sol
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name,
       Lam          Lam/Si  Lam
I set fire to the rain,
            Sol            Sol/La  Sol
And I threw us into the flames,
         Rem
Well, I felt something die,
          Rem       Fa             Lam          Sol
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time,


Oh, no,
Let it burn, oh,
Let it burn,
Let it burn.</pre>]
