Re                    Sol
When will I see you again?
              Sim
You left with no goodbye 
      Re               Sol
Not a single word was said
   Re             Re/Fa#     Sol 
No final kiss to seal any sins
      Sim             Re             Sol  
I had no idea of the state we were in


                La
I know I have a fickle heart
      La
And a bitterness
      Sim
And a wandering eye
      Fa#              La
And a heaviness in my head


                Re      Remaj7  Sol  
But don't you remember?
            Mim     La4  La  Re
Don't you remember?
    Sol                Re  Fa#madd6    Sol
The reason you loved me          before
                 Mim  La4  La    Re
Baby please remember me     once more


Re                                       Sol
When was the last time that you thought of me?
               Sim        Re                  Sol
Or have you completely erased me from your memory?
        Re           Fa#madd6      Sol
I often think about where I went wrong
           Sim  Re             Sol
The more I do     the less I know


                La
I know I have a fickle heart
      La
And a bitterness
      Sim
And a wandering eye
      Fa#              La
And a heaviness in my head


                Re      Remaj7  Sol  
But don't you remember?
            Mim     La4  La  Re
Don't you remember?
    Sol                Re  Fa#madd6    Sol
The reason you loved me          before
                 Mim  La4  La    Sol
Baby please remember me     once more


La#                    Fa/Do
Gave you the space so you could breathe

          Do                        Sol
I kept my distance so you would be free

   La#                       Rem
In hope that you'd find the missing piece

   Mim                La4   La
To bring you back to me


                Mi      Sol#madd6  La  
Why don't you remember?
            Fa#m     Si4  Si  Mi
Don't you remember?
    La                Mi  Sol#madd6    La
The reason you loved me          before
                 Fa#m  Si4  Si    La
Baby please remember  me     once more


Mi                    La
When will I see you again?</pre>]
