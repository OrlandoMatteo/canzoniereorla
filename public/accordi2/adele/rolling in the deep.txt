Lam                  Mi
There's a fire starting in my heart,
Sol                                                Mim         Sol
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

Lam              Mi
Finally, I can see you crystal clear.

Sol                                     Mim                Sol
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare.

Lam                          Mi
See how I leave, with every piece of you
Sol                          Mim                  Sol
Don't underestimate the things that I will do.
Lam                Mi
There's a fire starting in my heart,
Sol                                Mim                       Sol
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

Fa                       Sol
The scars of your love, remind me of us.
Mim                      Fa
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
Fa                       Sol
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
Mim              Mi
I can't help feeling...


Mim                           Lam                              Sol
We could have had it all... (I wish you, never had met me)...
Fa                                                                         
          Sol
Rolling in the Deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Lam                                                                       Sol
Your had my heart... (I wish you)... Inside of your hand (Never had met me)
Fa                                                                        
                                   Sol
And you played it... (Tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (Rolling in the deep)


Lam                    Mi
Baby I have no story to be told,
           Sol                            Mim                             Sol
But I've heard one of you and I'm gonna make your head burn.
Lam                      Mi
Think of me in the depths of your despair.
 Sol                                          Mim                         
                Sol
Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared.

Fa                  Sol                   Mim
The scars of your love, remind me of us.

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
Fa                       Sol                      Mim
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless

Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Whoa)

And pay me back in kind- You reap just what you sow.
