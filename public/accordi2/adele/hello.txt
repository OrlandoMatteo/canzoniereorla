    Mim Sol      Re Do
Hello,  it's me
       Mim          Sol                Re
I was wondering if after all these years
               Do          Mim  Sol       Re  Do
You'd like to meet, to go over everything
               Mim                 Sol
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
             Re         Do
But I ain't done much healing


    Mim Sol         Re     Do
Hello,  can you hear me?
        Mim          Sol              Re             Do
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
              Mim    Sol      Re Do
When we were younger and free
      Mim               Sol               Re                 Do
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet


                Mim   Re        Sim  Do
There's such a difference between us
       Mim  Re   Do
And a million miles


 Mim          Do        Sol  Re
Hello from the other side
   Mim                Do       Sol   Re
I must've called a thousand times 
         Mim      Do                Sol              Re
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
            Mim       Do     Sol          Re       
But when I call you never seem to be home
 Mim          Do     Sol  Re
Hello from the outside
    Mim               Do         Sol  Re
At least I can say that I've tried 
         Mim      Do           Sol            Re
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
                 Mim       Do              Sol         Re       Mim Sol Re Do
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore


    Mim Sol    Re    Do
Hello,  how are you?
         Mim         Sol           Re           Do
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
   Mim Sol             Re  Do
I hope that you're well
        Mim           Sol                       Re            Do
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?


         Mim   Re          Sim     Do       Mim     Re       Do
It's no secret that the both of us are running out of time


   Mim         Do          Sol  Re
So hello from the other side
   Mim                Do       Sol   Re
I must've called a thousand times 
         Mim      Do                Sol              Re
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
            Mim       Do     Sol          Re       
But when I call you never seem to be home
 Mim          Do     Sol  Re
Hello from the outside
    Mim               Do         Sol  Re

                 Mim       Do              Sol         Re       Mim Do 
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

 Re  Sol        Mim Do

 Re  Sol        Mim Do
