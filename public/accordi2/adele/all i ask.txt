[<pre>Mi Sol#m La Si


Mi                     Sol#m
I will leave my heart at the door
        La
I won't say a word
        Si
They've all been said before, you know
     
   Mi                 Sol#m
So why don't we just play pretend
              La
Like weâ€™re not scared of what is coming next
   Si                Sol#      Sol#/Do
Or scared of having nothing left


      Do#m                   Mi/Si
Look, don't get me wrong, I know
                 Fa#m
There is no tomorrow
Fa#m7/Si
All I ask


Mi             Do#7       Do#7/Fa Fa#m
Is if this is my last night with you
La/Si              Si7        Si/Re#   Mi
hold me like I'm more than just a friend
          Do#7     Do#7/Fa Fa#m
give me a memory I  can use
La/Si            Si7
take me by the hand
Si/Re#     Mi       Si/Re#   Do#m
while we do what lovers do
           Mi/Sol#     Fa#m7
it matters how this ends
       La/Si                    Mi
'Cause what If I never love again?


Sol#m  La  Si


Mi
I don't need
     Sol#m
Your honesty
             La
it's already in your eyes
        Si
and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me

Mi               Sol#m
No one knows me like you do
                      La
and since you're the only one that mattered
         Si            Sol#  Sol#/Do
tell me, who do I run to?


      Do#m                   Mi/Si
Look, don't get me wrong, I know
                Fa#m
There is no tomorrow
Fa#m7/Si
All I ask is 


Mi             Do#7        Do#7/Fa Fa#m

           Mi/Sol#     Fa#m7
it matters how this ends
       La/Si                  Mi/Do#
'Cause what If I never love again?


                La      Sol#m Fa#m
Let this be our lesson in love
                La/Si  Si7   Si/La    Sol#m
let this be the way  we remember us
                   Sol#    Sol#/Do Sol#/Re# Do#m
I don't want to be cruel or       vicious 
            Fa#m7
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
La/Si       Re7sus4
All I ask is 


Fa            Re7          Re/Fa# Solm
