  Everybody loves the things you do
                  Rem                  Do
 From the way you talk to the way you move
Lam          Mim              Fa      Do/Mi
  Everybody here is watching  you
                     Rem                            Do        Do Do/Si
 Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come  true

Lam          Mim                  Fa     Do/Mi
  But if by chance you're here alone
              Rem              Do    Do Do/Si
 Can I have a moment before I go
Lam                   Mim               Fa     Do/Mi
  Cause I've been by myself all night long
               Rem                Sol4  Sol
 Hoping you're someone I used to know

 You look like a movie
                  Mim     Fa
 You sound like a song
               Fa         Sol
 My God this reminds me
                 Mim     Sol
 Of when we were young

 Let me photograph you in this light, in case it is the last time
         Do          Mim            Fa              Sol
 That we might be exactly like we were before we realized
          Lam            Do/Mi             Fa         Fam
 We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
                    Rem     Fa                    Sol4  Sol
 It was just like a movie,   it was just like a song


Lam          Mim                Fa      Do/Mi
   I was so scared to face my fears
              Rem                    Do      Do Do/Si
 Cause nobody told me that you'd be here
Lam            Mim            Fa     Do/Mi
  And I swear you moved overseas
                Rem                   Sol4 Sol
 That's what you  said when you left me


                        Fa     Sol
 You still look like a movie
                        Mim    Fa
 You still sound like a song
               Fa         Sol
 My God this reminds me

 It's hard to admit that, everything just takes me back
         Rem
 To when you were there
         Sol              Sol/Sol#
 To when you were there
       Lam               Do/Sol         Fa               Do/Mi
 And a part of me keeps holding on, just in case it hasn't gone
         Rem
 I guess I still care
    Sol
 Do you still care?


                     Fa     Sol
 It was just like a movie

 It was just like a song

 Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it makes me reckless
