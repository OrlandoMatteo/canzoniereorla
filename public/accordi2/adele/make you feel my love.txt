Sol                          Re
  When the rain is blowing in your face
Fa                        Do
  And the whole world is on your case
Dom                    Sol
  I could offer you a warm embrace
La7            Re7           Sol
  To make you feel my love.


Sol                              Re
  When evening shadows and the stars appear
Fa                              Do
  And there is no one there to dry your tears
Dom                       Sol
  I could hold you for a million years
La7            Re7          Sol
  To make you feel my love.


Do                              Sol
  I know you haven't made your mind up yet
Si7            Do              Sol
  But I would never do you wrong.
Do                               Sol
  I've known it from the moment that we met
La7                        Re7  
No doubt in my mind where you belong


Sol                       Re
  I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
Fa                            Do
  I'd go crawling down the avenue.
Dom                            Sol
  No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
La7            Re7          Sol
  To make you feel my love.

Dom    Sol   La7 Re7 Sol   


Do                              Sol
  The storms are raging on the rollin' sea.
Si7           Do            Sol
  And on the highway of regret
Do                                 Sol
  The winds of change are blowing wild and free.
La7                             Re7      
You ain't seen nothing like me yet.


Sol                                   Re
  I could make you happy, make your dreams come true.
Fa                        Do
  Thereâ€™s nothing that I would not do.
Dom                      Sol
  Go to the ends of the earth for you
La7            Re7          Sol
  To make you feel my love.
La7            Re7          Sol
  To make you feel my love.</pre>]
