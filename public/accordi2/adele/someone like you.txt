I heard that you're       settled down
         Mim                        
That you    found a girl and you're   
Do
married now
Sol                Sim/Fa#
I heard that your dreams came true
          Mim                     
Guess she gave you things I didn't 
Do
give to you
Sol                      Sim/Fa#
Old friend, why are you so shy?
           Mim                 
Ain't like you to hold back or 
Do
hide from the light
 

Re6                        
I hate to turn up out of the 
Mim
blue uninvited
      Do
But I  couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
     Re6                         
I'd hoped you'd see my face and 
Mim
that you'd be reminded
         Do                Mim
That for me it isn't o-   ver

  You know how the       time flies
     Mim                    Do
Only    yesterday was the time of our lives
        Sol                   Sim/Fa#
We were born and raised in a      summer haze
      Mim                     Do
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

Re
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
  Mim
Regrets and mistakes, they are memories made
Do
