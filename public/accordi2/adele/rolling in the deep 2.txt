Sim             Fa#m
There's a fire starting in my heart
   La                           Fa#m               La
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Sim                Fa#m
Finally I can see you crystal clear
   La                           Fa#m             La
Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
Sim                     Fa#m
See how I leave with every piece of you
 La                      Fa#m               La
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
Sim                Fa#m
There's a fire starting in my heart
  La
Reaching a fever pitch
           Fa#m                La   Sol
And it's bringing me out the dark
             La                  Fa#m
The scars of your love remind me of us
             Sol
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
             La                       Fa#m
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
             Fa#m
I can't help feeling

                     Sim
We could have had it all
                       La
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
               Sol
Rolling in the deep

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
    La             Sim          La
You had my heart inside of your hand

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
        Sol                  La
And you played it, to the beat

(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Sim                Fa#m
Baby, I have no story to be told
      La
But I've heard one on you
           Fa#m                La
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Sim                   Fa#m
Think of me in the depths of your despair
   La
Make a home down there
        Fa#m              La
As mine sure won't be shared
 Sol
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
             La                  Fa#m

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all

Rolling in the deep

You had my heart inside of your hand
        La
But you played it, with a beating

Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (woah)

You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (woah)
