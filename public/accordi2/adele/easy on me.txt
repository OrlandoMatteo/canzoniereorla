[<pre>            Do                Lam7
There ain't no gold in this river
                Mim                    Famaj7
That I've been washing my hands in forever
        Sol    Do                 Lam7
I know there is hope in these waters
             Mim
But I can't bring myself to swim
    Famaj7
When I am drowning in this silence
            Famaj7
Baby, let me in

   Do  Lam7  Sol
Go easy    on me, baby
Mim     Lam7
I was still a child
 Do    Famaj7
Didn’t get the chance to
Do  Lam7    Sol
Feel the world around me
Mim       Lam7
I had no time to choose
 Do     Famaj7
What I chose to do
       Do        Lam7  Mim  Famaj7
So go easy on me

 Sol          Do
There ain't no room
               Lam7
For things to change
             Mim
When we are both so deeply
         Famaj7
Stuck in our ways
 Sol         Do
You can't deny
        Lam7
How hard I have tried
          Mim
I changed who I was
           Famaj7
To put you both first
              Famaj7
But now I give up

   Do  Lam7  Sol
Go easy    on me, baby
Mim     Lam7
I was still a child
 Do    Famaj7
Didn’t get the chance to
Do  Lam7    Sol
Feel the world around me
Mim       Lam7
I had no time to choose
 Do     Famaj7
What I chose to do
      Do  Lam7 Mim     Famaj7
So go easy      on me

Do                Lam7
I had good intentions
            Mim
And the highest hopes
                   Famaj7
But I know right now
                         Famaj7
It probably doesn't even show

Sol  Do  Lam7  Sol
Go easy    on me, baby
Mim     Lam7
I was still a child
 Do    Famaj7
Didn’t get the chance to
Do  Lam7    Sol
Feel the world around me
Mim       Lam7
I had no time to choose
 Do     Famaj7
What I chose to do
       Do        Lam7  Mim Famaj7
So go easy on me</pre>]
