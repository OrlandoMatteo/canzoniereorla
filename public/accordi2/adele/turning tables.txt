Sim7                         Sol        
    Close enough to start a war
        Mimadd9             Sol
All that I have is on the floor
Sim7                                    Sol
    God only knows what we're fighting for
        Mimadd9                Sol
All that I say, you always say more


Sol                         Mim      Mim7
I can't keep up with your turning tables
      Sol                   La
Under your thumb, I can't breathe


  Sim7      Sol       Re               Mim
So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
   Sim7      Sol      Re             Mim
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me
         Sim7   Sol               Re/Fa#      La
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
             Mim  Re   Sol               Sim7    Sol
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
           Mimadd9  Sol
To turning tables


Sim7                         Sol
     Under haunted skies I see you, oooh
Mimadd9                                  Sol
      Where love is lost, your ghost is found
Sim7                           Sol
     I braved a hundred storms to leave you
               Mimadd9                           Sol
As hard as you try, no I will never be knocked down

I can't keep up with your turning tables

Turning tables


Sim7                       Sol
Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own saviour
Re                            Mim
When the thunder calls for me
Sim7                       Sol
Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own saviour
Re                       La
Standing on my own two feet
