Just plug me in just like

I was eddie harris you're eating crazy

Cheese like you'd think

I'm from paris you know I get fly you

Think I get high you know that

I'm gone and I'm a tell you all why

So tell me who are you dissing maybe

I'm missing the reason that

You're smiling or wilding so

listen in my head I just want to

Take 'em down imagination set loose

and I'm gonna shake 'em

Down let it flow like a mud slide

when I get on I like to ride and

Glide I've got depth of perception

in my text why'all I get props at my

Mention 'cause I vex why'all

so what'cha want you're so funny with

The money that you flaunt

where'd you get your information from

You think that you can front when revelation comes

Re#m
You can't front on that

Well they call me mike d the ever

loving man I'm like spoonie gee

I'm the metropolitician you scream

and you holler about my

Chevy impala but the sweat is getting

wet around the ring around

Your collar but like a dream

I'm flowing without no stopping

Sweeter than a cherry pie with

ready whip topping goin' from

Mic to mic kickin' it wall to wall well

I'll be calling out you people

Like a casting call it's wack

when you're jacked in the back of a

Ride with your know with your flow

when you're out getting by

Believe me what you see is what you get

and you see me coming off

As you can bet I think

I'm losing my mind this time

This time I'm losing my mind

You can't front on that

But little do you know about something

that I talk about I'm tired

Of driving it's due time that

I walk about but in the meantime, I'm

Wise to the demise I've got eyes

in the back of my head so I realize

Well I'm dr. spock I'm here to rock

why'all I want you off the wall

If you're playing the wall

so what'cha want why'all suckers write me

Checks and then they bounce

so I reach in my pocket for the

Fresh amount see I'm the long leaner victor the cleaner

I'm the illest motherfucker

from here to gardena I'm as cool as a

Cucumber in a bowl of hot sauce

you've got the rhyme and reason

But no cause so if you're hot

to trot you think you're slicker

Than grease I've got news for you crews

You'll be sucking like a leach

Re#m
