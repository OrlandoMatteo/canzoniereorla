one more night
Sol#        Re#/Sol       Fam7    Re#
 I've been trying ooh so long to let you know
Sol#      Re#/Sol    Fam7
 Let you know how I feel
Sol#       Re#/Sol      Fam7       Re#
 And if I stumble if I fall, just help me back
Sol#       Re#/Sol  Fam7
 So I can make you see

               La#/Re   Re#            La# La#/Re Re#
Please give me one more night, give me one more  night
La#      Re#               Fam7       La#
One more night cos I can't wait forever
                      Re#            La#      Re#
Give me just one more night, oh just one more night
   La#      Re#               Fam7      La#
Oh one more night cos I can't wait forever

Sol#        Re#/Sol         Fam7
 I've been sitting here so long
Re#         Sol#     Re#/Sol       Fam7
Wasting time, just staring at the phone
Sol#        Re#/Sol            Fam7     Re#
 And I was wondering should I call you
              Sol#           Re#/Sol Fam11
Then I thought maybe you're not    alone

               La#/Re   Re#            La# La#/Re Re#
Please give me one more night, give me one more  night
La#      Re#               Fam7       La#
One more night cos I can't wait forever
                      Re#            La#      Re#
Give me just one more night, oh just one more night
   La#      Re#              Fam7       La#
Oh one more night cos I can't wait forever
        La#      Re#                 La# La#/Re Re#
Give me one more night, give me just one more  night
    La#      Re#         Fam7            La#
Ooh one more night, cos I can't wait forever

Dom7      Do#          Dom7
   Like a river to the sea
       Do#/Re#        Dom7
I will always be with you
    Do#          Dom7
And if you sail away
       Do#/Re#
I will follow you

        La#/Re   Re#                 La# La#/Re Re#
Give me one more night, give me just one more  night
   La#      Re#                Fam7       La#
Oh one more night, cos I can't wait forever

Sol#              Re#/Sol    Fam7             Re#
 I know there'll never be a time you'll ever feel the same
Sol#    Re#/Sol        Fam11
 And I know it's only words
Sol#         Re#/Sol         Fam7            Re#
 But if you change your mind  you know that I'll be here
Sol#           Re#/Sol  Fam11
 And maybe we both can learn

             La#/Re   Re#                 La# La#/Re Re#
Give me just one more night, give me just one more  night
    La#      Re#                Fam7       La#
Ooh one more night, cos I can't wait forever
             La#/Re   Re#                 La#      Re#
Give me just one more night, give me just one more night
    La#      Re#         Fam7             La#
Ooh one more night, cos I can't wait forever
