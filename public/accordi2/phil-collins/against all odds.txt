How can I just let you walk away, just let you leave without a trace

When I stand here taking every breath with you.. ooh
           Re#m7                          Sol#
You're the only one who really knew me at all

How can you just walk away from me, when all I can do is watch you leave
          Fa#add9            Sol#/Fa#          Fam7            La#m
Cos we've shared the laughter and the pain, and even shared the tears

So take a look at me now, cos there's just an empty space

And there's nothing left here to remind me, just the memory of your face
                      Do#                       Re#7/Sol#
Now take a look at me now, well there's just an empty space
               La#m           Fa#
And you coming back to me is against the odds
           Re#m7            Sol#4  Sol#
And that's what I've got to face.

I wish I could just make you turn around, turn around and see me cry

There's so much I need to say to you, so many reasons why

But to wait for you, is all I can do

Just take a look at me now, cos I'll still be standing here
               La#m          Fa#
And you coming back to me is against all odds
       Re#m7              Sol#
It's a chance I've got to take.
