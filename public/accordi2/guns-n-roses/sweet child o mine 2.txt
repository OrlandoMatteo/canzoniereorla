Re
She's got a smile that it seems to me
  Do
Reminds me of childhood memories
       Sol
Where everything
                                Re
Was as fresh as a bright blue sky
Re
Now and then when I see her face
    Do
She takes me away to that special place
         Sol
And if I stared too long
                              Re
I'd probably break down and cry


La               Do              Re
Whoa Oh, Sweet child o' mine
La               Do              Re
Whoa, Oh, Oh, Oh Sweet love o' mine

Re
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
   Do
As if they thought of rain
  Sol
I hate to look into those eyes
    Re
And see an ounce of pain
    Re
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
      Do
Where as a child I'd hide
    Sol
And pray for the thunder and rain
     Re
To quietly pass me by


La        Do              Re
Whoa Oh, oh, Sweet child o' mine
La              Do                Re
Whoa, Oh, Oh, Oh Sweet love o' mine
