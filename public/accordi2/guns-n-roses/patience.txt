Do
  Shed a tear cause I'm missing you

  I'm still alright to smile
La                              Re      Resus2 Re  Re4 Re  Resus2 Re
  Girl I think about you every day now
Do
  Was a time when I wasn't sure
       Sol
But you set my mind at ease
La                                  Re       Resus2 Re  Re4 Re  Resus2 Re

  Said woman, take it slow

It'll work itself out fine
Do              Sol              Re     Resus2 Re  Re4  Re  Resus2  Re
All we need is just a little patience

It'll come together fine

Do
  I sit here on the stairs
         Sol
Cause I'd rather be alone
   La
If I can't have you right now
      Re        Resus2 Re  Re4 Re  Resus2 Re
I'll wait, dear
Do
  Sometimes I get so tense
      Sol
But I can't speed up the time
    La
But you know love, there's one more thing
       Re   Resus2 Re  Re4  Re  Resus2  Re
To consider


Do             Sol
  Said woman, take it slow
    Do                    Mim
And things will be just fine
Do                 Sol             Re      Resus2 Re  Re4  Re  Resus2  Re
You and I’ll just use a little patience
Do             Sol
  Said sugar, take the time
          Do                    Mim
Cause the lights are shining bright
Do                Sol                 Re     Resus2 Re  Re4  Re  Resus2
You and I've got what it takes to make it
