  I used to love her
Fa#            Sol#
  But I had to kill her
Do#         Sol#          Fa#
  I used to love her, Mm, yeah
             Sol#
But I had to kill her
Fa#        Sol#
  I had to put her
Fa#        Sol#
  six feet under
Fa#         Sol#              Do#
  And I can still hear her complain
Do#         Sol#          Fa#

But I had to kill her
Fa#          Sol#
  I knew I'd miss her
Fa#           Sol#
  So I had to keep her
Fa#            Sol#            Do#
  She's buried right in my backyard!!!
