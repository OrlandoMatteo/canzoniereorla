Fa                     Rem
When I look into your eyes
                    Do
I can see a love restrained
Fa                  Rem
But darling when I hold you
                          Do
Don't you know I feel the same
Rem                   Sol
Cause nothin' lasts forever
                            Do
And we both know hearts can change
Rem                      Sol
And it's hard to hold a candle
                     Do
In the cold November rain


Fa                               Rem
We've been through this such a long, long time
                        Do
Just tryin' to kill the pain, oh yeah
Fa
But lovers always come and lovers always go
    Rem                                    Do
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away
Fa
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
Rem
I could rest my head
                           Do
Just knowin' that you were mine, all mine
Rem                Sol
So if you want to love me
                   Do
Then darlin' don't refrain
Rem                  Sol
Or I'll just end up walkin'
                     Do
In the cold November rain


Fa                             Sol
Do you need some time on your own?
       Fa                  Sol
Do you need some time all alone?
          Fa                        Sol
Everybody needs some time on their own
                   Fa                  Sol
Don't you know you need some time all alone


Mim          Fa               Do
I know it's hard to keep an open heart
Mim        Fa                   Rem
When even friends seem out to harm you
Mim         Fa            Do
But if you could heal a broken heart
Mim       Fa              Sol
Wouldn't time be out to charm you


Fa                                Sol
Sometimes I need some time on my own
            Fa                  Sol
Sometimes I need some time all alone
          Fa                        Sol
Everybody needs some time on their own
                   Fa                  Sol
Don't you know you need some time all alone


Fa
And when your fears subside
Rem                Do
And shadows still remain, oh yeah
Fa                   Rem
I know that you can love me
                            Do
When there's no one left to blame
Rem                Sol
So never mind the darkness
                    Do
We still can find a way
Rem                  Sol
Cause nothin' lasts forever
                   Do
Even cold November rain

   Don't you you think that you need somebody
