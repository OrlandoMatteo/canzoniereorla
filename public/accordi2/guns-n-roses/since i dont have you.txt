I don´t have plans and schemes
    Fa#      Sim           Do#7
And I don´t have hopes and dreams
Fa#        Sim
I--- don´t have anything
Sol#m              Do#7
since I don´t have you
    Fa#        Sim       Do#7
And I don't have fond desires
    Fa#      Sim        Do#7
and I don´t have happy hours
Fa#         Sim
I--- don't have anything
Sol#m              Fa#
since I don´t have you
Sol#m           Fa#
  I never will again
Sol#m                    Fa#
  When you were not on me, in walked on misery
  Sol#m                    Do#7
  And it's been here since then

since I don´t have you
