Do               Mim
I walked across an empty land
Rem                          Fa          Sol
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
Do                Mim
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Rem                       Fa          Sol
Sat by the river, and it made me complete


Lam                Mim
Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
Rem                         Fa              Sol
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
Lam              Mim       
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
Rem                      Fa                   Sol
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin


Do               Mim
I came across a fallen tree
Rem                        Fa          Sol
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Do                 Mim
Is this the place we used to love?
Rem                               Fa        Sol
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?


Lam                Mim
Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
Rem                         Fa              Sol
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
Lam              Mim
So tell me when you're gonna let me in
 Rem                          Fa              Sol
I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin


Fa                 Do                 Lam Sol
And if you have a minute, why don't we go
Fa             Do              Lam Sol
Talk about it somewhere only we know?
Fa                 Do           Lam
This could be the end of everything
Rem
So why don't we go

Somewhere only we know?
