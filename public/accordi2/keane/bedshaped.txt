       Mi  Lamaj7  Do#m  Si La

Mi Lamaj7                           Do#m
   Many's the time I ran with you down
    Si                      Mi
The rainy roads of our old town
Lamaj7                             Do#m
Many the lives we lived in each day
    Si4        Si
And buried altogether
      Do#m     Sol#
Don't laugh at me
      Re#m  Si
Don't look away
       Si4
You'll follow me back
La/Si    Fa#
With the sun in your eyes
    Mi
And on your own
Do#m
Bedshaped
    Si4     Si
And legs of stone
       Fa#
You'll knock on my door
    Mi
And up we'll go
   Do#m
In white light
  Si4         Si
I don't think so
    La
But what do I know?
Fa#m6
What do I know?
Mi
I know!

  Lamaj7                            Do#m
I know you think I'm holding you down
         Si               La/Si Mi
And I've fallen by the wayside now
      Lamaj7                                 Do#m
And I don't understand the same things as you
    Si4   Si
But I do
      Do#m     Sol#
Don't laugh at me
      Re#m  Si
Don't look away
Si4
You'll follow me back
La/Si    Fa#
With the sun in your eyes
    Mi
And on your own
Do#m
Bedshaped
    Si4     Si
And legs of stone
       Fa#
You'll knock on my door
    Mi
And up we'll go
   Do#m
In white light
  Si4         Si
I don't think so
    La
But what do I know?
Fa#m6
What do I know?
Mi       Mi4 Mi Mimaj7
I know!

Mi  Lamaj7  Do#m  Si4 Si Si7

Fa#  Mi  Do#m  Si4 Si

Fa#  Mi  Do#m  Si4 Si   Fa#

    Mi
And up we'll go
   Do#m
In white light
  Si4         Si
I don't think so
    La
But what do I know?
Fa#m6
What do I know?
Mi
I know!
