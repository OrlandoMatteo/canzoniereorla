Re#       Fa#maj7
 Why do I have to fly
Do#                    Fam
Over every town up and down the line?
   Re#          Fa#maj7
I'll die in the clouds above
    Do#                   Fam
And you that I defend, I do not love
  Fa#                Re#m7
I wake up, it's a bad dream
             Sol#
No one on my side

I was fighting
Fam                 Fa#
But I just feel too tired

To be fighting
Re#m7                      Sol#
Guess I'm not the fighting kind

Re#          Fa#maj7
 Where will I meet my fate?
Do#                    Fam
Baby I'm a man, I was born to hate
  Re#          Fa#maj7
And when will I meet my end?
Do#                         Fam
In a better time you could be my friend

Wouldn't mind it
Fam               Fa#
If you were by my side

But you're long gone
Re#m7                  Sol#    Fa#
Yeah you're long gone now

Re#m7     Sol#
Where do we go?
  Do#/Fa     Fa#
I don't even know
   Re#/Sol     Re#m7
My strange old face
        Sol#               Fa#    Re#m7
And I'm thinking about those days
