This is the last time
     Do                Sol
That I will say these words
                         Sim
I remember the first time
     Do               Sol
The first of many lies
                         Solmaj7
Sweep it into the corner
   Do/Sol               Sol
Or hide it under the bed
                             Solmaj7
Say these things they go away
    Do/Sol        Sol
But they never do

          Domaj7               Sim
Something I wasn't sure of
      Mim                  La9
But I was in the middle of
          Domaj7         Sim
Something I forget now
         Mim                Re/Fa#
But I've seen too little of

    Sol    Sim7
The last time

You fall on me for anything you like
     Sol        Sim7
Your one last line
    Lam7           Re
You fall on me for anything you like
    Mim        Sim7
And years make everything alright
    Lam7           Re
You fall on me for anything you like
    Mim  Sim     Lam7   Re
And I no I don't mind

Sol                  Solmaj7
This is the last time
     Do/Sol           Sol
That I will show my face
                  Solmaj7
One last tender lie
    Do/Sol                 Sol
And then I'm out of this place
                          Solmaj7
So tread it into the carpet
   Do/Sol              Sol
Or hide it under the stairs
                             Solmaj7
Say that some things never die
            Do           Sol
Well I tried and I tried

          Domaj7               Sim
