[<pre>Mim                                      Do
   I look up from the ground to see your sad and teary eyes
            Sol                              Re
   You look away from me and I see there’s something you're trying to hide
       Mim                             Do
  And I, reach for your hand but it's cold, you pull away again
         Sol                     Re
  And I, wonder, what’s on your mind


Do                            Mim
  And then you say to me “you made a dumb mistake”
Re                              Re
 You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
            Do                                     Mim
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren’t your friends, they were my mates
      Re                                Re
And I feel the colour draining from my face
         
And my friends said…


Mim                              Do
   I know you love her but it’s over mate
Sol                            Re
   It doesn’t matter, put the phone away
Mim                    Do
   It’s never easy to walk away
               Sol       Re
   But let her go oh oh oh
           
   It’ll be alright


Mim                                    Do
   So I still look back at all the messages you’d sent
         Sol                              Re
   And I know it wasn’t right but it was fucking with my head
      Mim                           Do
   And everything deleted like the past yeah it was gone
       Sol                               Re
   And when I touched your face I could tell you're moving on


Do                               Mim
  But it’s not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
         Re                           Re
It’s the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
    Do                              Mim
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
      Re            Re
But I just want to stay…
         
And my friends said…


Mim                              Do
   I know you love her but it’s over mate
Sol                            Re
   It doesn’t matter, put the phone away
Mim                    Do
   It’s never easy to walk away
               Sol       Re
   But let her go oh oh oh
           
   It’ll be okay

Mim                      Do
  It's gonna hurt for a bit of time
Sol                         Re
  So, bottoms up, let’s forget tonight
Mim                              Do
   You’ll find another and you’ll be just fine
        Sol        Re
Let her go oh oh oh


    Mim         Do
But nothing heals
    Sol         Re
The past like time
   Mim          Do
And they can't steal
    Sol                   Re
The love you’re born to find
    Mim         Do
But nothing heals
    Sol         Re
The past like time
   Mim          Do
And they can't steal
    Sol                   Re
The love you’re born to find


Mim                              Do

It’ll be alright

It’ll be alright</pre>]
