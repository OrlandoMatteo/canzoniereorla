      Dom7
I can tell by your eyes that you've
Fa7                    La#
prob'bly been cryin' forever,
        Dom7
And the stars in the sky don't mean
Fa7                       La#      Re#
nothin' to you, they're a mirror
               Fa               La#
I don't want to  talk about it,
        Rem/La   Solm7    Re#
how you broke my heart
                      Fa7               Re#
If I stay here just a little bit longer,
                          Fa7
If I stay here, won't you listen
      Dom7  Fa7       La#
to my heart, ...whoa, heart

     Dom7
If I stand all alone,
         Fa7                         La#
will the shadow hide the color of my heart

Blue for the tears, black for the night's fears
