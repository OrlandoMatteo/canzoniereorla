[<pre>Sol  Lam
I can tell by your eyes, 
              Re                     Sol
that you've probably been crying forever.
          Lam                          Re
And the stars in the sky don't mean nothing, 
                  Sol    
to you they're a mirror.


Do                   Re        
I don't wanna      talk about it, 
          Sol            Re/Fa#    Mim
    how you broke my heart.
Do                          Re
If I stay here just a little bit longer, 
Do                             Re     
if I stay here won't you listen
        Lam       Re           Sol
to my heart,        oh my heart.


Sol      Lam
If I stand all alone, 
         Re                             Sol
will the shadows hide the colours of my heart.

Blue for the tears, black for the night's fears
