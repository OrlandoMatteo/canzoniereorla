        Do#m7  Mi  Do#m7  Mi

Fa#m7          Lamaj7            Sol#m7
She sits alone waiting for suggestions
Fa#m7            Lamaj7             Sol#m7
He's so nervous avoiding all the questions
Fa#m7                 Lamaj7            Sol#m7
His lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding
Fa#m7                Lamaj7                Sol#m7
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinking

       Do#m7
If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Mi
Come on sugar let me know
 Do#m7
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Mi
Come on honey tell me so
                Do#m7  Mi
Tell me so baby

Fa#m7           Lamaj7             Sol#m7
He's acting shy looking for an answer
Fa#m7                Lamaj7              Sol#m7
 Come on honey let's spend the night together
    Fa#m7              Lamaj7             Sol#m7
Now hold on a minute before we go much further
Fa#m7             Lamaj7           Sol#m7
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother
Fa#m7                    Lamaj7       Sol#m7
 They catch a cab to his high rise apartment
   Fa#m7                 Lamaj7             Sol#m7
At last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant

 Do#m7
If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Mi
Come on honey tell me so
 Do#m7
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
 Mi
Come on sugar let me know

Do#m7  Mi

    Sol#m7                  Do#m
His heart's beating like a drum
        Sol#m7                   Do#m
'Cos at last he's got this girl home
Fa#m7      Lam            Si7
Relax baby now we're all alone

Do#m  Si  Do#m  Si

Do#m  Si  Do#m  Si

Fa#m7  Lamaj7  Solm7 Fa#m7  Lamaj7  Sol#m7

Fa#m7                  Lamaj7                Sol#m7
They wake at dawn 'cos all the birds are singing
Fa#m7                    Lamaj7                     Sol#m7
 Two total strangers but that ain't what they're thinking
Fa#m7              Lamaj7             Sol#m7
Outside it's cold, misty and it's raining
Fa#m7                Lamaj7               Sol#m7
 They got each other neither one's complaining
Fa#m7                       Lamaj7             Sol#m7
 He say's I'm sorry but I'm out of milk and coffee
Fa#m7                   Lamaj7             Sol#m7
Never mind sugar we can watch the early movie
