Lam
Oh, the wind whistles down
Fa
The cold dark street tonight
          Do                             Mim
And the people they were dancing to the music vibe
          Lam
And the boys chase the girls with the curls in their hair
Fa
While the shy tormented youth sit way over there
          Do
And the songs they get louder
                       Mim
Each one better than before


                        Lam
And you're singing the songs, thinking this is the life
                         Fa
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
                   Do
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
                         Mim
Where you gonna sleep tonight

                        Lam
And you're singing the songs, thinking this is the life
                         Fa
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
                   Do
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
                         Mim
Where you gonna sleep tonight
                         Lam
Where you gonna sleep tonight

           Lam
So you're heading down the road in your taxi for four
            Fa
And you're waiting outside Jimmy's front door
     Do                                   Mim
But nobody's in and nobody's home 'til four
           Lam
So you're sitting there with nothing to do
          Fa
Talking about Robert Riger and his motley crew
      Do                                                   Mim
And where you're gonna go and where you're gonna sleep tonight


                        Lam
And you're singing the songs, thinking this is the life
                         Fa
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
                   Do
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
                         Mim
Where you gonna sleep tonight?

                        Lam
And you're singing the songs, thinking this is the life
                         Fa
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size
                   Do
Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go?
                         Mim
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
                         Lam
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
