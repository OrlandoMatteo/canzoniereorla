          La#m7
Punctured bicycle
     Do#            Sol#
on a hill side desolate,
                             La#m7   Do#
will nature make a man of me yet
          Sol#
when this charming car
        La#m7     Do#
this charming man
    Sol#
why pamper lifes complexity

when the leather runs smooth
                   La#m7   Do#
on the passengers seat...
           Sol#
I would go out tonight
                             La#m7   Do#
but i havent got a stitch to wear
     Sol#
this man said its gruesome
                                La#m7   Do#
that someone so handsome should care...
