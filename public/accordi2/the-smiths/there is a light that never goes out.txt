Lam7 Sol       Lam7  Sol   Famaj7   Do  Sol
    Take me out    tonight
              Lam7               Sol
where there's music and there's people
        Lam7        Sol     Famaj7   Do  Sol
who are young and alive
Lam7     Sol       Lam7   Sol
Driving in your car
  Famaj7                  Do
I never never want to go home
  Sol               Lam7    Sol Lam7  Sol
because I haven't got one
   Famaj7   Do  Sol
anymore


Lam7 Sol       Lam7  Sol  Famaj7     Do Sol
    Take me out     tonight
          Lam7         Sol
because I want to see people and I
Lam7         Sol      Famaj7   Do Sol
want to see lights
Lam7     Sol       Lam7   Sol
Driving in your car
   Famaj7                Do
oh please don't take me home
  Sol              Lam7           Sol
because it's not my home, it's their home
        Lam7        Sol     Famaj7    Do Sol
and I'm welcome no more


Rem  Famaj7   Sol


         Do             Lam7
And if a double-decker bus
Famaj7
crashes into us
Sol           Do
  to die by your side
          Famaj7           Rem
is such a heavenly way to die
         Do           Lam7
And if a ten ton truck
Famaj7
kills the both of us
Sol           Do
  to die by your side
    Famaj7                     Rem
the pleasure the privilege is mine

   Take me out    tonight
           Lam7               Sol
oh take me anywhere, I don't care
        Lam7   Sol Famaj7 Do Sol
I don't care
           Lam7      Sol    Lam7
And in the darkened underpass
 Sol        Famaj7                       Do Sol
I thought Oh God, my chance has come at last

            Lam7           Sol
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I
Lam7            Sol    Famaj7 Do Sol
just couldn't ask)

        Lam7    Sol Famaj7 Do Sol
I don't care
     Lam7     Sol       Lam7  Sol
Just driving in your car
  Famaj7                  Do
I never never want to go home
  Sol               Lam7      Sol Lam7 Sol
because I haven't got one
          Famaj7       Do Sol
I haven't got one
