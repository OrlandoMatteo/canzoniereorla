I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour

But heaven knows I'm miserable now

I was looking for a job, and then I found a job
    Sol#m7           Siadd9
And heaven knows I'm miserable now

What she asked of me at the end of the day
  Sol#m7            Siadd9  Do#
Caligula would have blushed
        Fa#maj7                 Re#m7

  Sol#m7       Siadd9
And I naturally fled
