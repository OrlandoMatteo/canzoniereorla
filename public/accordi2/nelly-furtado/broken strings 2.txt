       La#m
Let me hold you For the last time
                              Fa#add9
It's the last chance to feel again
        La#m7                        Fa#add9  Re#m7
But you broke me Now I can't feel anything
       La#m7                      Fa#add9
When I love you It's so untrue I can't even convince myself
          La#m7            Do#              Fa#  Re#m7
When I'm speaking It's the voice of someone else
      Fa#  Sol# La#m  Fa#         Sol#       Fam
Oh it tears me  up I tried to hold on but it hurts too much
   Fa#        Sol#           Fam          Fa#
I tried to forgive but it's not enough To make it all okay

You can't play on broken strings You can't feel anything
          Re#m                La#m
That your heart don't want to feel
        Do#                           Sol#
I can't tell you something that ain’t real
       Fa#             La#m        Do#                Sol#
Oh the truth hurts And life’s worse I can't like it anymore
       Re#m              La#m        Sol#
When I love you a little less than before

        La#m                 Fa#
Oh what are we doing We are turning into dust
         La#m                Fa#  Re#m7
Playing house in the ruins of us
         La#m
Running back through the fire
              Fa#
When there's nothing left to say
           La#m             Do#
It's like chasing the very last train
             Fa#          Re#m7
when it's too late    too late
      Fa#  Sol# La#m  Fa#         Sol#       Fam
Oh it tears me  up I tried to hold on but it hurts too much
