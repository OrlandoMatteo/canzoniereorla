 Everybody look at me, me

I walk in the door you start screaming

Come on everybody what you here for?

Move your body around like a nympho

Everybody get your necks to crack around

All you crazy people come on jump around

I want to see you all on your knees, knees

You either want to be with me, or be me!

Maneater, make you work hard
               Sol#
Make you spend hard
                 La#m
Make you want all, of her love
        Fa#
She's a maneater
         Fam
make you buy cars
             Sol#
make you cut cards
                    La#m
make you fall, real hard in love

Wish you never ever met her at all!

 And when she walks she walks with passion

when she talks, she talks like she can handle it

when she asks for something boy she means it

even if you never ever seen it

everybody get your necks to crack around

all you crazy people come on jump around

you doing anything to keep her by your side

because, she said she love you, love you long time!
