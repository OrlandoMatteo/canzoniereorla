        Fam  Re#  Do#  La#m

       Fam
In the day
       Re#
In the night
       Do#
Say it right
        La#m
Say it all
           Fam
You either got it
       Re#
Or you don't
           Do#           La#m
You either stand or you fall
          Fam     Re#
When your will is broken
        Do#             La#m
When it slips from your hand
             Fam         Re#
When there's no time for joking
          Do#         La#m
There's a hole in the plan

   Fam             Re#              Do#  La#m
Oh you don't mean nothing at all to me
   Fam             Re#              Do#  La#m
No you don't mean nothing at all to me
    Fam             Re#             Do#   La#m
But you got what it takes to set me free
   Fam             Re#          Do#  La#m
Oh you could mean everything to me

        Fam          Re#  Do#        La#m
I can't say that I'm not lost and at fault
        Fam        Re#            Do#           La#m
I can't say that I don't love the light and the dark
        Fam        Re#             Do#    La#m
I can't say that I don't know that I am alive
        Fam       Re#          Do#
And all of what I feel I could show
       La#m
You tonight you tonight

   Fam             Re#              Do#  La#m
Oh you don't mean nothing at all to me
   Fam             Re#              Do#  La#m
No you don't mean nothing at all to me
    Fam             Re#             Do#   La#m
But you got what it takes to set me free
   Fam             Re#          Do#  La#m
Oh you could mean everything to me

        Fam            Re#
From my hands I could give you
Do#               La#m
Something that I made
        Fam             Re#
From my mouth I could sing you
         Do#           La#m
Another brick that I laid
        Fam            Re#
From my body I could show you
  Do#       La#m
A place God knows
           Fam               Re#
You should know the space is holy
       Do#          La#m   Fam7  Re#  Do#  La#m
Do you really wanna go?
