There's a boy   I know, he's the one I dream of
        Fa# Si   Do#                   Fa#       Si Do#
Looks into    my eyes, takes me to the clouds above
      Fa# Si  Do#                 Fa#      Si Do#
Ooh I lose control, can't seem to get enough
       Fa# Si    Do#                     Fa#      Si Do#
When I wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love
Fa#         La#m7
 How will I know
                  Sol#m7
(Don't trust your feelings)
           Si
How will I know
Fa#         La#m7
 How will I know
               Sol#m7
(Love can be deceiving)
           Si/Do#
How will I know

Fa#         Si      Do#       Re#m
 How will I know if he really loves me
Fa#      Si          Do#
 I say a prayer with every heart beat
Fa#        Si      Do#      Re#m
 I fall in love whenever we meet
Fa#         Si         Do#
 I'm asking you 'cause you know about these things
Fa#         Si      Do#           Re#m
 How will I know if he's thinking of me
Fa#       Si            Do#
 I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Fa#         Si      Do#       Re#m
 Falling in love is so bitter sweet
Fa#           Si            Do#
 This love is strong why do I feel weak

    Fa#     Si   Do#
Oh, wake me, I'm shaking,
               Fa#         Si  Do#
wish I had you near me now
              Fa# Si  Do#
Said there's no     mistaking,
               Fa#         Si  Do#
what I feel is really love
    Fa#
Oh, tell me
