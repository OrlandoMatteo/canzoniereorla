Sol                        Mim7
Share my life, take me for what I am
       Domaj7                           Sim7      Lam11 Re7
'Cause I'll never change all my colours for you
Sol                      Mim7
Take my love, I'll never ask for too much
     Domaj7                                  Sim7   Lam11 Re7
Just all that you are and everything that you do
Lam7                        Sim7      Mim7
I don't really need to look very much further
Lam7                     Sim7            Mim7
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
Lam7                             Sim7
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
      Domaj7
Can't run from myself
        Lam7       Do/Re
There's nowhere to hide

              Re#maj7          Dom7

Stay in my arms if you dare

Or must I imagine you there
Fa6         Dom7         Rem7 Solm7
Don't walk away from me...

Sol                          Mim7        Re
You see through right to the heart of me
    Do                                       Sim7      Lam7 Re7
You break down my walls with the strength of your love
Sol                         Mim7
I never knew love like I've known it with you
       Do                         Sim7      Lam11 Re7
Will a memory survive, one I can hold on to
