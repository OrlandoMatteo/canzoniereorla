       Mi  Mi/Re#  Do#m7  Mi/Re#

Mi          Mi/Re#  Do#m7
 As I lay me down,
             Mi/Sol#   Fa#m7
Heaven hear me now
                   Mi/Sol#  Laadd9
I'm lost without a cause
                   Si7sus4   Mi
After giving it my all
              Mi/Re#     Do#m7
Winter storms have come
              Mi/Sol#   Fa#m7
And darkened my sun
                         Mi/Sol#  Laadd9
After all that I've been through
                        Si7sus4  Si7
Who on earth can I turn to?

          Mi  Si/Re#
I look to you
      Do#m7   Mi/Sol#  Fa#m7
I look to you
               Mi/Sol#        Laadd9
After all my strength is gone,
                Si7sus4   Si7
In you I can be strong
          Mi   Si/Re#
I look to you
     Do#m7     Mi/Sol#  Fa#m7
I look to you
                  Mi/Sol#    Laadd9
And when melodies are gone,
                Si7sus4   Si7
In you I hear a song
          Mi  Mi/Re#  Do#m7  Si
I look to you

Mi            Mi/Re#     Do#m7
 About to lose my breath,
                       Mi/Sol#  Fa#m7
There's no more fighting left,
                Mi/Sol#   Laadd9
Sinking to rise no more,
                        Si7sus4  Si7  Mi
Searching for that open door
                         Mi/Re#  Do#m7
And every road that I've taken
             Mi/Sol#   Fa#m7
Led to my regret
                                 Mi/Sol#  Laadd9
And I don't know if I'm going to make it
                        Si7sus4   Si7
Nothing to do but lift my head

          Mi  Si/Re#
I look to you
      Do#m7   Mi/Sol#  Fa#m7
I look to you
               Mi/Sol#        Laadd9
After all my strength is gone,
                Si7sus4   Si7
In you I can be strong
          Mi   Si/Re#
I look to you
     Do#m7     Mi/Sol#  Fa#m7
I look to you
                  Mi/Sol#    Laadd9
And when melodies are gone,
                Si7sus4   Si7
In you I hear a song
          Do#m7
I look to you

   Do#m/Si
My levees are broken
   Laadd9
My walls have come
              Si Do#m7
Tumbling down on me
    Mi/Si
The rain is falling
  Laadd9
Defeat is calling
               Si     Fa#m7
I need you to set me free
        Mi/Sol#                  Laadd9
Take me far away from the battle
           Si7sus4        Si7
I need you    Shine on me

          Mi  Si/Re#
I look to you
      Do#m7   Mi/Sol#  Fa#m7
I look to you
               Mi/Sol#        Laadd9
After all my strength is gone,
                Si7sus4   Si7
In you I can be strong
              Mi   Si/Re#
I look to you
     Do#m7     Mi/Sol#  Fa#m7
I look to you
                  Mi/Sol#    Laadd9
And when melodies are gone,
                Si7sus4   Si7
In you I hear a song
          Mi  Mi/Re#  Do#m7  Mi/Re#
I look to you
          Mi  Mi/Re#  Do#m7  Mi/Re#
I look to you
          Mi
I look to you
