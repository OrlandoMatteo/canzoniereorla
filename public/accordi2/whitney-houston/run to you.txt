I know that when you look at me
Do#/Sol#         Do#m/Sol#
There's so much that you just don't see
    Sol#/Re#      La#/Re
But if you would only take the time
  Do#m/Sol#         Re#7sus4     Re#
I know in my heart you'd find
Fam
A girl who's scared sometimes
Mi6
Who isn't always strong
Sol#/Re#
Can't you see the hurt in me?
  Do#6/Re#     Re#9
I feel so all alone

Re#     Do#         La#m7  Re#7sus4
I wanna run to you (oooh)
Re#7    Sol#         Fa7+ Fa7
I wanna run to you (oooh)
          La#m7              Do#
Won't you hold me in your arms
    Re#7sus4            Do#/Re#
And keep me safe from harm
Re#     Do#         La#m7  Re#7sus4
I wanna run to you (oooh)
Re#      Sol#          Fa7+ Fa7
But if I come to you (oooh)
        Do#maj7             Do#m/Mi   Re#7sus4
Tell me, will you stay or will you
Re#  Sol#  Do#/Sol#  Sol#  Fa#/Sol# Mi/Sol#
run away

Sol#            Sol#maj7
Each day, each day I play the role
   Do#/Sol#  Do#m/Sol#     Fa#/Sol#
Of someone  always in control
       Sol#/Re#      La#/Re
But at night I come home and turn the key
        Do#m/Mi              Re#7sus4    Mi9 Do7/Mi Fam
There's nobody there, no one cares for me...
                           Mi6
What's the sense of trying hard to find your dreams
  Sol#/Re#
Without someone to share it with
Re#7sus4               Re#9
Tell me what does it mean?

Re#     Do#         La#m7  Re#7sus4
I wanna run to you (oooh)
Re#7    Sol#         Fa7+ Fa7
I wanna run to you (oooh)
          La#m7           Do#
Won't you hold me in your arms

But if I come to you (oooh)
        Do#maj7             Do#m/Mi   Re#7sus4
Tell me, will you stay or will you
Re#  Fam   Mi6
run away...
     Sol#/Re#  La#/Re
run away

La#m7
 I need you here
                   Sol#/Do
I need you here to wipe away my tears
         La#/Re    Re#7sus4
To kiss away my fears
                Fa7sus4
If you only knew how much...

Fa      Re#         Dom7  Fa7sus4
I wanna run to you (oooh)
