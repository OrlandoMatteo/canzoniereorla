                 Do
You're just too good to be true
              Domaj7
Can't take my eyes off you
               Do7
You feel like Heaven to touch
        Fa
I wanna hold you so much
             Fam7
At long last love has arrived
             Do
And I thank God I'm alive
                        Rem7
You're just too good to be true
              Sol7          Do
Can't take my eyes off you


            Do
Pardon the way that I stare
                 Domaj7
There's nothing else to compare
                  Do7
The sight of you leaves me weak
             Fa
There are no words left to speak
            Fam7
But if you feel like I feel
               Do
Please let me know that it's real
                 Rem7
You're just too good to be true
              Sol7          Do
Can't take my eyes off you


             Rem7
I need you, baby
             Sol
And if it's quite alright
            Mim7
I need you, baby
          Lam7
To warm the lonely nights
             Rem7
I love you, baby
 Sol                 Do
Trust in me when I say:

            Rem7
Oh, pretty baby
             Sol
Don't let me down, I pray
           Mim7
Oh, pretty baby,
            Lam7
now that I found you, stay
              Rem7
And let me love you, baby
        La#7 La7
Let me love you
