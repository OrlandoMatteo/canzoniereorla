[<pre>Do
I remember what you wore on the first day
Lam
You came into my life and I thought
Fa                    Sol                    Do
"Hey, you know, this could be something"
Do
'Cause everything you do and words you say
Lam
You know that it all takes my breath away
Fa           Sol                 Do
And now I'm left with nothing




                  Fa
'Cause maybe it's true
             Sol
That I can't live without you
      Fa                  Sol
Maybe two is better than one
                Fa
There's so much time
   Sol
To figure out the rest of my life
        Lam                  Sol          Fa
And you thought that it got me coming undone
                 Lam     Sol           Do
And I'm thinking two is better than one




Do
I remember every look upon your face
Lam
The way you roll your eyes
            Fa
The way you taste
            Sol                  Do
You make it hard for breathing
Do
'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
Lam
I think of you and everything's okay
Fa           Sol             Do
I'm finally now believing


                 Fa
That maybe it's true
              Sol
That I can't live without you
      Fa                  Sol
Maybe two is better than one
                Fa
There's so much time
   Sol
To figure out the rest of my life
        Lam                  Sol          Fa
And you thought that it got me coming undone
                 Lam     Sol           Fa     Sol 
Sol
And I'm thinking two is better than one


Do
I remember what you wore on the first day
Lam
You came into my life and I thought, "Hey,"


           Fa
Maybe it's true
             Sol
That I can't live without you
      Fa                  Sol
Maybe two is better than one
                Fa
There's so much time
   Sol
To figure out the rest of my life
        Lam                  Sol         Fa
And you thought that it got me coming undone
                 Fa
And I'm thinking

I can't live without you
              Sol
'Cause, baby, two is better than one
                Fa
There's so much time
   Sol
To figure out the rest of my life
         Lam
But I'll figure it out
          Sol            Fa
When it's all said and done
Lam     Sol           Do
Two is better than one
Lam     Sol           Do
Two is better than one</pre>]
