[<pre>Re         Sol/Re                   Do#/Re
Today is a winding road that's taking me to places that I didn't want to go
     La/Re
Whoa (whoa, whoa, whoa)                      
Re         Sol/Re                   Do#/Re
Today in the blink of an eye I'm holding on to something and I do not know why
 La/Re
I tried


           Sim/Re
I tried to read between the lines
           La/Re
I tried to look in your eyes
          Fa#m/Re
I want a simple explanation
               Re
For what I'm feeling inside
               Sol/Re
I gotta find a way out
               La/Re
Maybe there's a way out


Re                        La/Re
     Your voice was the soundtrack of my summer
                   Sol/Re
Do you know you're unlike any other?
         Sim/Re        La/Re
You'll always be my thunder, and I said
Re                       La/Re
    Your eyes are the brightest of all the colors
             Sol/Re
I don't wanna ever love another
       Sim/Re          La/Re
You'll always be my thunder
   Sol/Re           La/Re
So bring on the rain
                     Re
And bring on the thunder


Re         Sol/Re                   Do#/Re
Today is a winding road tell me where to start and tell me something I don't know
     La/Re
Whoa (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Re         Sol/Re                   Do#/Re
Today I'm on my own I can't move a muscle and I can't pick up the phone
 La/Re
I don't know (I don't know, I don't know, I don't know)


           Sim/Re
And now I'm itching for the tall grass
           La/Re
And longing for the breeze
          Fa#m/Re
I need to step outside
               Re
Just to see if I can breathe
               Sol/Re
I gotta find a way out
               La/Re
Maybe theres a way out

        Mim/Re
Yeah I'm walking on a tightrope
              Sim/Re
I'm wrapped up in vines
    La/Re
I think we'll make it out
                     Sol/Re
But you just gotta give me time
Re
Strike me down with lightning
         Sim/Re
Let me feel you in my veins
   La/Re                                          Sol/Re
I wanna let you know how much I feel your pain
