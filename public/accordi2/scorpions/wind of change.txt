Do                Rem
 I follow the Moskva
               Do
 Down to Gorky Park
                  Rem      Lam  Sol Do !
 Listening to the wind of change
Do                 Rem
 An August summer night
                  Do
 Soldiers passing by
                  Rem      Lam  Sol Do !
 Listening to the wind of change


Fa  Rem  Fa  Rem  Lam   Rem  Lam  Sol  Do


Do                     Rem
 The world is closing in
              Do
 Did you ever think
                     Rem          Lam    Sol  Do !
 That we could be so close, like brothers
Do                    Rem
 The future's in the air
                    Do
 I can feel it everywhere
                  Rem          Lam    Sol
 Blowing with the wind of change


Do     Sol         Rem           Sol
 Take me to the magic of the moment
      Do     Sol
On a glory night
          Rem            Sol             Lam
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
 Fa               Sol         Do
In the wind of change


Do                 Rem
 Walking down the street
             Do
 Distant memories
                   Rem          Lam    Sol  Do !
 Are buried in the past forever
Do                Rem
 I follow the Moskva
               Do
 Down to Gorky Park
                 Rem          Lam    Sol 
 Listening to the wind of change


Do     Sol         Rem           Sol

On a glory night

Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams

With you and me
Do     Sol         Rem           Sol
Take me to the magic of the moment

Where the children of tomorrow dream away
       Fa !     Sol !
In the wind of change


Lam                        Sol
 The wind of change blows straight
                  Lam
Into the face of time
                           Sol
Like a stormwind that will ring
                              Do
The freedom bell for peace of mind
                   Rem
Let your balalaika sing
                        Mi
What my guitar wants to say


Fa  Sol  Mi  Lam  Fa  Sol  Lam
Fa  Sol  Mi  Lam  Rem  Mi


Do     Sol         Rem           Sol
Take me to the magic of the moment

Take me to the magic of the moment
      Do     Sol
On a glory night
          Rem            Sol             Lam
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
       Fa !     Sol !
In the wind of change
