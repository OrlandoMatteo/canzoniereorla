[<pre> Do#   Si    Mi          La
One, two boys by the river
Mi            La
Down by the water
      Si              Mi
Tellin' riddles in the dark
Do#       Si     Mi          La
With fireflies under the moonlight
Mi          La             Si          Mi
Carvin' the insides of a tree with a knife


Do#         Si             La             Mi
Ever hear the one about the boy's big sister
Do#        Si            La
His best friend come along
Mi                   Si
He tried to kiss her


       La
The only difference
     Sol#
That I see
         Fa#
Is you are exactly the same
     Si
As you used to be


One boy lives in a tower
With bow and arrow
And the artificial heart
With his girl
Late in the summer
He loaded the cannon
With a jealous appetite
They say that children now
They come in all ages
And maybe sometimes old men die
With little boy faces


Do#  Si    La    Mi
You always said that you needed some
Do#  Si    La    Mi    Si
But you always had more, more than anyone</pre>]
