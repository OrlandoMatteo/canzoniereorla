 I could hardly believe it
       Fa/La
When I heard the news today
  Re#/Sol         Re#m/Fa#            La#/Fa  Fa7
I had to come and get it straight from you
La#
 They said you were leavin'
          Fa/La
Someone's swept your heart away
         Re#/Sol        Re#m/Sol Fa        Mim7b5  Fa7sus4 Fa/Re#
From the look upon your face,   I see it's true
   La#/Re
So tell me all about it, tell me 'bout the
             Re#     La#/Re
plans you're makin'
Dom7                    Solm7  Re7    Re#  Fa7sus4
 Then tell me one thing more before I go

Fa      Re#maj7       Fa/Re#           Rem7     Solm7
Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Re#maj7               Fa/Re#        Rem7  La#7sus4 La#7
 Now that I've been lovin' you so long
Re#maj7                Fa/Re# Rem7      Solm7
How am I supposed to live    without you
Dom7 La#/Re  Re#           Fa4  Fa Solm7
How am I supposed to carry on
     Dom7     La#/Re    Re#    Fa4 Re#maj7   Fa/Re# La#/Re Re7b9 Re7
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

La#
 Too proud for cryin'
       Fa/La
Didn't come here to break down
            Re#/Sol          Re#m/Fa#    La#/Fa  Fa/Re#
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
La#
 And how can I blame you
       Fa/La
When I build my world around
              Re#/Sol         Re#m/Fa#
The hope that one day we'd be so much
La#/Fa Mim7b5      Fa4 Fa/Re#
more   than friends
    Rem7
And I don't wanna know the price I'm
              Re#maj7    La#/Re
gonna pay for dreaming
Dom7               Solm7           Re#add9  Fa7sus4
When even now it's more than I can take
