  Mim9                      Soladd9/Si Domaj7
I talk to you but its not the same    as touchin' you
    Mim9                    Soladd9/Si    Domaj7
And every time you whisper my name, I wanna run to you
Doadd9/Mi   Re/Fa# Mim9
 We'll be together, it won't be long, it won't be long
Domaj7                 Readd9/Fa#   Lam7
 But it feels like forever,
                   Do/Re
and its hard to be strong

                Lam7        Sim7
Baby 'cause I'm missing you now
        Lam7       Mim7
And its drivin' me crazy
        Domaj7        Do/Re
How I'm needin' you baby
    Domaj7        Sim7
I'm missing you now
      Re#maj7          Rem7
Can't wait till I'm alone with you
   Dom7                         Mim9  Soladd9/Si  Domaj7
To show you how I'm missing you now

Mim9                      Soladd9/Si       Domaj7
Wishin' you were here by my side is all that I can do
       Mim9                   Soladd9/Si
Got my arms around my pillow at night, they should be
Domaj7
holdin' you
Doadd9/Mi      Re/Fa#   Mim9
 Thought I was stronger, how could I know, how could
  Sim7   Domaj7
I know
                       Readd9/Fa# Lam7
I can't take this much longer,
                  Do/Re
its so hard on my soul

                Lam7        Sim7
Baby 'cause I'm missing you now
        Lam7       Mim7
And its drivin' me crazy
        Domaj7        Do/Re
How I'm needin' you baby
    Domaj7        Sim7
I'm missing you now

Can't wait till I'm alone with you
   Dom7                         Mim9
To show you how I'm missing you now

Dom7               Rem7                  Re#maj7
 Baby I just can't wait, till I see your face
                             Dom7
Chase away this loneliness inside
                        Rem7                    Re#maj7
When you're close to my heart, right here in my arms
              Re#/Fa
Then and only then, will I be satisfied

                Mim7  Sim7  Domaj7
I'm missing you now

Mim7  Sim7  Domaj7
