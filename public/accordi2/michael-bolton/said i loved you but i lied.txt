 You are the candle, love's the flame
Re
 A fire that burns through wind and rain
Dom7
 Shine your light on this heart of mine

Sol#               Re#    La#
  Till the end of time
                        Dom
You came to me like the dawn through the night
      Sol#             La#
Just shinin' like the sun
                 Dom
Out of my dreams and into my life
    Sol#              La#         Re#   La#  Dom
You are the one, you are the one

       Sol#             Re#   La#  Dom
Said I loved you but I lied
               Sol#              Re#    La#   Dom
'Cause this is more than love I feel inside
       Sol#                 Re#   La#  Dom
Said I loved you but I was wrong
                  Sol#        Re#     La#    Dom
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong

 With all my soul I've tried in vain
Re
 How can mere words my heart explain
Dom7
 This taste of heaven so deep so true

Sol#            Re#   La#
 I've found in you
               Dom
So many reasons in so many ways
   Sol#             La#
My life has just begun
                  Dom
Need you forever, I need you to stay
    Sol#              La#          Re#  La#  Dom
You are the one, you are the one
