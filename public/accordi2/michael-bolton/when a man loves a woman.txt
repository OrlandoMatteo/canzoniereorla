When a man loves a woman
           Do#/Sol#              Fa#
Can't keep his mind on nothin'else
           Fa#/Sol#
He'd trade the world
                 Do#         Fa#/Sol#
For a good thing he's found
          Do#           Sol#/Do   La#m7
If she is bad, he can't see it
    Do#/Sol#         Fa#
She can do no wrong
                     Fa#/Sol#
Turn his back on his best friend
      Do#            Fa#/Sol#
If he puts her down

       Do#         Sol#/Do   La#m7
When a man loves a woman
               Do#/Sol#    Fa#
Spend his very last dime
          Fa#/Sol#        Do#     Fa#/Sol#
Trying to hold on to what he needs
             Do#     Sol#/Do    La#m7
He'd give up all his comforts
              Do#/Sol#     Fa#
And sleep out in the rain
                   Fa#/Sol#
If she said that's the way
   Do#          Si/Do#
It ought to be

Loving eyes can never see
