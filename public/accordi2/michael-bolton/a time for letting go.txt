              Miadd9
Sometimes you find out what you wanted
      Laadd9
Isn't really what you need
        Miadd9
And the dream in all its promise
    Laadd9/Do#
Was never meant to be
         Miadd9/Sol#
All your hopes and desperation
      Laadd9
Won't make it like it was
          Do#m7
And you believe the pain will never pass
  Fa#m7               Si7sus4
Believe me in time it does

             Mi
You've gotta know when love is over
             Fa#m7
You've gotta learn to carry on
             Miadd9/Sol#              Sol#7/Do
And with the world upon your shoulders
          Do#m                  La/Si
You walk away when hope is gone
          Mi
When your golden road has reached the end
    Fa#m7                Miadd9/Sol#     Laadd9
You find the strength to start again you know
          Fa#m7    Mi/Sol#
There's a time for love
   La/Si            Mi6  Mi  Laadd9
a  time for letting go

            Miadd9
When you're standing tall tomorrow
        Laadd9
Looking back at yesterday
            Miadd9
Through the memory of your sorrow
        Laadd9/Do#
How the dawn was so far away
          Miadd9/Sol#
You'll be far beyond the shadow
      Laadd9
Where hearts can learn to shine
           Do#m7
And you'll realize the endless night
    Lam/Do           Si7sus4
Was only a moment in time

             Mi
You've gotta know when love is over
             Fa#m7
You've gotta learn to carry on
             Miadd9/Sol#              Sol#7/Do
And with the world upon your shoulders
          Do#m                  La/Si
You walk away when hope is gone
          Mi
When your golden road has reached the end
    Fa#m7                Miadd9/Sol#     Laadd9
You find the strength to start again you know
          Fa#m7    Mi/Sol#
There's a time for love
   La/Si              Mi
a  time for letting go

Do
 The night is long the night is cold
Soladd9/Si
 With nothing to believe in
Do
 Just hold on, 'cause life goes on
Fa           Sol7sus4       Si7sus4
 Your new day is waiting, let go and let it begin

             Mi
You've gotta know when love is over
             Fa#m7
You've gotta learn to carry on
             Miadd9/Sol#              Sol#7/Do
And with the world upon your shoulders
          Do#m                Lam/Do  La/Si
You walk away when hope is gone
          Mi
When your golden road has reached the end
    Fa#m7                Miadd9/Sol#     Laadd9
You find the strength to start again you know
          Fa#m7    Mi/Sol#
There's a time for love
   La/Si            Mi6  Mi  Laadd9
a  time for letting go
