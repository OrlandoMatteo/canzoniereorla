Where the days are short and the nights are long

        Mi            La
   They walk and I'll walk
        Mi            La
   They fish and I'll fish
        Mi           La
   They sin and I'll sin
        Mi           La
   They fly and I'll fly
                 Mi                 Do#m
   Where they're out they're having fun
          La      Si      Mi
   In the war Californian sun

                                         Mi
Well I'm going out west out on the coast
                                                Mi
Where the Californian girls are really the most

        Mi            La
   They walk and I'll walk
        Mi            La
   They fish and I'll fish
        Mi           La
   They sin and I'll sin
        Mi           La
   They fly and I'll fly
                 Mi                 Do#m
   Where they're out they're having fun
          La      Si      Mi
   In the war Californian sun

       Mi  La  Mi  La

       Mi  Do#m  La Si Mi

                                         Mi
Well the girls are frisky in old 'Frisco
                                      Mi
A pretty little chick wherever you go

        Mi            La
   They walk and I'll walk
        Mi            La
   They fish and I'll fish
        Mi           La
   They sin and I'll sin

   Where they're out they're having fun
          La      Si      Mi
   In the war Californian sun
                 Mi                 Do#m
   Where they're out they're having fun
          La      Si      Mi
   In the war Californian sun
