       Rem Do/Mi Fa    Rem Do/Mi Fa

Rem        Do/Mi    Fa
 Under the arc of a weather stain boards,
Rem      Do/Mi    Fa
 Ancient goblins, and warlords,
Rem              Do/Mi       Fa
 Come out of the ground, not making a sound,
Rem           Do/Mi    Fa
 The smell of death is all around,
Do                      Rem
 And the night when the cold wind blows,
Do             Rem    La#      Do
 No one cares, nobody knows

Rem                Fa          Do      La#
I don't want to be buried in a Pet Sematary,
Rem              Do            La#     Do
 I don't want to live my life again,
Rem                Fa          Do      La#
I don't want to be buried in a Pet Sematary,
Rem              Do            La#    Do
 I don't want to live my life again

Rem     Do/Mi         Fa
 Follow Victor to the sacred place,
Rem           Do/Mi    Fa
 This ain't a dream, I can't escape,
Rem         Do/Mi      Fa
 Molars and fangs, the clicking of bones,
Rem      Do/Mi    Fa
 Spirits moaning among the tombstones,
Do                       Rem
 And the night, when the moon is bright,
Do              Rem             La#      Do
 Someone cries, something ain't right

Rem                Fa          Do      La#
I don't want to be buried in a Pet Sematary,
Rem              Do            La#     Do
 I don't want to live my life again,
Rem                Fa          Do      La#
I don't want to be buried in a Pet Sematary,
Rem              Do            La#    Do
 I don't want to live my life again

La#   Rem   La#   Do

Rem          Do/Mi     Fa
 The moon is full, the air is still,
Rem       Do/Mi    Fa
 All of a sudden I feel a chill,
Rem        Do/Mi           Fa
 Victor is grinning, flesh rotting away,
Rem        Do/Mi    Fa
 Skeletons dance, I curse this day,
Do                      Rem
 And the night when the wolves cry out,
Do                Rem             La#     Do
 Listen close and you can hear me shout

Rem                Fa          Do      La#
I don't want to be buried in a Pet Sematary,
Rem              Do            La#     Do
 I don't want to live my life again,
Rem                Fa          Do      La#
I don't want to be buried in a Pet Sematary,
Rem              Do            La#    Do
 I don't want to live my life again

Rem  Do  La#  Do   Rem  Do  La#  Do
