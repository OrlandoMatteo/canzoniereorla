       Do#m  Si  Do#m  Si  Do#m  Si  Laadd9

   Do#m      Mi     Do#m              Mi
No one ever thought this one would survive
Do#m            Mi           Laadd9      Si4
Helpless child, gonna walk a drum beat behind
Do#m          Mi     Do#m          Mi
Lock you in a dream, never let you go
Do#m          Mi       Laadd9   Si4
Never let you laugh or smile, not you

      Laadd9         Si4        Do#m        Laadd9
Well, I just want to walk right out of this world,
                 Si4          Do#m
'Cause everybody has a poison heart
Laadd9         Si4        Do#m        Laadd9
I just want to walk right out of this world,
                 Si4          Do#m  Si  Do#m  Si
'Cause everybody has a poison heart

Do#m                  Mi       Do#m    Mi
Making friends with a homeless torn up man
Do#m     Mi                Laadd9           Si4
He just kind of smiles, it really shakes me up
        Do#m            Mi         Do#m  Mi
There's danger on every corner but I'm okay
Do#m             Mi               Laadd9       Si4
Walking down the street trying to forget yesterday

      Laadd9         Si4        Do#m        Laadd9
Well, I just want to walk right out of this world,
                 Si4          Do#m
'Cause everybody has a poison heart
Laadd9         Si4        Do#m        Laadd9
I just want to walk right out of this world,
                 Si4          Do#m  Si4
'Cause everybody has a poison heart
         Do#m  Si4   Do#m    Si4         Laadd9
a poison heart, a poison heart, a poison heart ... yeah!

Mi    La    Mi    La

              Do#m Mi     Do#m      Mi
You know that life really takes its toll
      Do#m         Mi           Laadd9          Si4
And a poet's gut reaction is to search his very soul
Do#m            Mi       Do#m      Mi
So much damn confusion before my eyes,
    Do#m             Mi           Laadd9            Si
But nothing seems to phase me and this one still survives

      Laadd9         Si4        Do#m        Laadd9
Well, I just want to walk right out of this world,
                 Si4          Do#m
'Cause everybody has a poison heart
Laadd9         Si4        Do#m        Laadd9
I just want to walk right out of this world,
                 Si4          Do#m
'Cause everybody has a poison heart
     Laadd9         Si4        Do#m        Laadd9
Well I just want to walk right out of this world,
                 Si4          Do#m  Si4
'Cause everybody has a poison heart
         Do#m  Si4       Do#m    Si4
a poison heart, a poison heart,
         Do#m  Si4       Do#m    Si4
a poison heart, a poison heart,
         Do#m  Si4       Do#m    Si4
a poison heart, a poison heart,
         Laadd9     Si Do#m
a poison heart
