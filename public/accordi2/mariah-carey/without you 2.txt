No I can't forget this evening
        La#m
Or your face as you were leaving
      Sol#m
But I guess that's just the way
          La#7sus4  La#7
The story goes
            Re#m                Re#m7          Dom7b5
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
       Fa#/Do#   Do#7sus4 Do#7
Yes it shows
     Fa#
No I can't forget tomorrow
       La#m
When I think of all my sorrow
       Sol#m
When I had you there
                   La#7sus4 La#7
But then I let you go
             Re#m
And now it's only fair that
Re#m/Do#         Sol#7                Fa#/Do#  Do#7sus4
I should let you know what you should know

        Fa#
I can't live
   Re#m
If living is without you
        Sol#m
I can't live
        Si/Do#
I can't give anymore
      Fa#
Can't live
   Re#m
If living is without you
