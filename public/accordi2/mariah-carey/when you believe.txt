Sim            La
Many nights we prayed
     Fa#m        Sim
With no proof anyone could hear
                 Solmaj7
In our hearts, a hopeful song
   Mim7         Fa#m
We barely understood
    Si          La/Do#
Now we are not afraid
                         Miadd9
Although we know there's much to fear
Solmaj7          Fa#m7
We were moving mountains long
  Mim7            Laadd9/Do#
Before we knew we could, oh yes

Re                    La/Do#            Sim
 There can be miracles when you believe
               La6         Sol          La7add6 La7
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Re                     La/Do#            Sim
 Who knows what miracles you can achieve
           Fa#m7      Sol          Mim7
When you believe, somehow you will
              La/Do# Sim
You will when you believe

         Sim             La
Oh yeah, in this time of fear
     Fa#m7           Sim
When prayer so often proves in vain
                    Solmaj7
Hope seems like the summer birds
    Mim7           Fa#m7
Too swiftly flown away
    Si               La/Do#
Yet now I'm standing here
                      Miadd9
My heart's so full, I can't explain
Solmaj7             Fa#m7
Seeking faith and speaking words
  Mim7              La/Do#
I never thought I'd say

Mi                    Si/Re#
 There can be miracles  when you believe
Do#m7           Si6         La           Si7add6 Si7
 Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Mi                     Si/Re#
 Who knows what miracles  you can achieve
Do#m7       Sol#m7     La           Mi/Sol#
 When you believe, somehow you will
Fa#m7 Mi6       Si/Re# Mi     Do#m7  La  Si7sus4 Si/La
  You will when you  believe

           Laadd9/Do#    Si/Re#    Mi4  Mi  Si/Re# Do#m7
They don't always happen when you ask
         Laadd9/Do#              Mi4  Mi  Fa#m7 Mi/Sol#
And it's easy to give in to your fear
    Lamaj7          La6
But when you're blinded by your pain
      Si7sus4                Si
Can't see your way clear through the rain
  Laadd9/Do#
A small but still resilient voice
     Si7sus4
Says hope is very near,

Fa#
oh
                    Do#/Fa             Re#m
There can be miracles when you believe
               Do#6        Si           Do#7
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Fa#                     Do#/Fa           Re#m
 Who knows what miracles you can achieve
           La#m       Si
When you believe, somehow you will
Re#m             Sol#m7
Somehow you will
              Do#   Re#m    Do#  Si
You will when you believe

You will when you
                    Fa#
You will when you believe
       Re#m7
Just believe
Fa#
I believe, I believe
       Re#m7
Just believe
                    Fa#
You will when you believe
