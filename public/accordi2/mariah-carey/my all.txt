       Dom7  Re7  Solm  Sol7

              Dom7
I am thinking of you
Re7             Solm
In my sleepless solitude tonight
                 Dom7      Re7
If it's wrong to love you
                   Solm
Then my heart just won't let me be right
            Fa         Re#maj7
'Cause I've drowned in you
                 Re7
And I won't pull through
                  Solm
Without you by my side

            Dom7   Re7
I'd give my all to have
     Solm     Fa         Re#maj7
Just one more night with you
            Dom7    Fa
I'd risk my life to feel
     La#maj7        Re#maj7
Your body next to mine
                  Lam7b5  Sol#7
'Cause I can't go on
              Solm   Fa     Mim7b5
Living in the memory of our song
            Dom7         Re7    Solm
I'd give my all for your love tonight

             Dom7    Re7
Baby can you feel me
              Solm
Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
              Dom7     Re7
I can see you clearly
          Solm
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
        Fa        Re#maj7
And yet you're so far
               Re7
Like a distant star
                 Solm
I'm wishing on tonight

            Dom7   Re7
I'd give my all to have
     Solm     Fa         Re#maj7
Just one more night with you
            Dom7    Fa
I'd risk my life to feel
     La#maj7        Re#maj7
Your body next to mine
                  Lam7b5  Sol#7
'Cause I can't go on
              Solm   Fa     Mim7b5
Living in the memory of our song
            Dom7         Re7    Solm
I'd give my all for your love tonight

Dom7  Re7  Solm     Dom7  Re7  Solm

Fa Re#maj7  Re7  Solm

            Dom7   Re7
I'd give my all to have
     Solm     Fa         Re#maj7
Just one more night with you
            Dom7    Fa
I'd risk my life to feel

Your body next to mine
                  Lam7b5  Sol#7
'Cause I can't go on

Living in the memory of our song

I'd give my all for your love tonight
        Dom7         Re7
Give my all for your love
