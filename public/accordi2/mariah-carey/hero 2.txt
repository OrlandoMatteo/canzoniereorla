Si7       Mi
There's a hero
       Mi/Re
If you look inside your heart
          Do#m7
You don't have to be afraid
            La/Si   Si7
Of what you are
           Mi
There's an answer
       Re/Mi
If you reach into your soul
        Do
And the sorrow that you know
           Si7sus4  Si7
Will melt away

Mi               Si/Re# Do#m
 And then a hero comes along
                     Si    Lamaj7
With the strength to carry on
                  Mi/Sol# Fa#m7
And you cast your fears aside
        La/Si           Mi
And you know you can survive
                      Si/Re#  Do#m
So when you feel like hope is gone
       Mi/Si           La
Look inside you and be strong
                   Mi/Sol#  Fa#m7
And you'll finally see the truth
       La/Si        Mi   Do#m7  La
That a hero lies in you

       Mi
It's a long road
         Mi/Re
When you face the world alone
       Do#m7
No one reaches out a hand
           La/Si   Si7
For you to hold
        Mi
You can find love
       Readd9/Fa#
If you search within yourself
        Do
And the emptiness you felt
          Si7sus4
Will disappear

Mi               Si/Re# Do#m
 And then a hero comes along

And you cast your fears aside
        La/Si           Mi
And you know you can survive
                      Si/Re#  Do#m
So when you feel like hope is gone
       Do#m/Si         La
Look inside you and be strong
                   Mi/Sol#  Fa#m7
And you'll finally see the truth
       La/Si        Mi

Do     Sol/Si   Si
  Lord knows
           Re
Dreams are hard to follow
Do             Sol/Si
 But don't let anyone
Sol Re/Fa# Mim7 Re     Do
Tear       them away
     Sol/Si   Sol
Hold on
           Re           Do
There will be tomorrow
   Sol/Si
In time
                La/Si
You'll find the way
