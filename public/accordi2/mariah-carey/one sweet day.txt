Sorry, I never told you
Sol#              Do#maj7

'Cause you've flown away
  Re#7sus4
So far away
 Sol#         Do#maj7
Never had I imagined
Sol#                  Do#maj7
Living without your smile
Sol#                     Do#maj7
Feeling and knowing you hear me

It keeps me alive
 Re#7sus4
Alive

      Sol#                                 Do#maj7

        Sol#                               Do#maj7
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
      Sol#                        Do#maj7
And I know eventually we'll be together, together

Darling, I never showed you

Assumed you'd always be there

(I thought you'd always be there)
Sol#                         Do#maj7
I, I took your presence for granted
      Fa#
But I always cared

(But I always cared)
      Re#7sus4
