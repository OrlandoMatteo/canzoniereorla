        Mim9  La  Fa#m7 Sim7

  Mim9
I know that you've been waiting for it
La
I'm waiting too
   Sim7                  Fa#m7     Sim7
In my imagination I'd be all up on you
  Mim9
I know you got that fever for me
La
Hundred and two
          Fa#m7           Sim7
And boy I know I feel the same

My temperature's through the roof

             Mim9
If there's a camera up in here
           La
Then it's gonna leave with me
      Sim7  Fa#m7 Sim7
When I do (I do)
             Mim9
If there's a camera up in here
          La
Then I'd best not catch this flick
    Fa#m7  Sim7
On YouTube (YouTube)
              Mim9
'Cause if you run your mouth and brag
           La
About this secret rendezvous
Sim7            Fa#m7 Sim7
I will hunt you down
               Mim9
'Cause they be all up in my bidness
       La
Like a Wendy Interview
            Fa#m7   Sim7
But this is private

Between you and I

         Mim9
Touch my body
              La
Put me on the floor
            Sim7
Wrestle me around
                  Fa#m7
Play with me some more
Sim7     Mim9
Touch my body
                La
Throw me on the bed
             Fa#m7
I just wanna make you feel
Sim7
Like you never did
         Mim9
Touch my body
               La
Let me wrap my thighs
                Sim7
All around your waist
              Fa#m7
Just a little taste
Sim7     Mim9
Touch my body
                 La
Know you love my curves
             Fa#m7   Sim7
Come on and give me what I deserve

And touch my body

    Mim9
Boy you can put me on you
       La
Like a brand new white tee
Sim7
I'll hug your body tighter

Than my favorite jeans
  Mim9
I want you to caress me

Like a tropical breeze
    Fa#m7
And float away with you

In the Caribbean Sea

             Mim9
If there's a camera up in here
           La
Then it's gonna leave with me
      Sim7  Fa#m7 Sim7
