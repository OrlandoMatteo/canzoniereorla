       Famaj7  Mim7  Rem7  Famaj7

       Famaj7 Sol  Mim7 Famaj7

       Famaj7 Sol  Mim7 Famaj7

Famaj7
 I didn't mean it
Sol
When I said I didn't love you, so
Mim7                   Famaj7
 I should have held on tight

I never shoulda let you go

 I didn't know nothing
Sol
I was stupid, I was foolish
      Mim7       Famaj7
I was lying to myself
                   Sol
I could not fathom that I would ever

Be without your love
Mim7                 Famaj7
 Never imagined I'd be

Sitting here beside myself

'Cause I didn't know you
       Sol
'Cause I didn't know me

But I thought I knew everything
Mim7    Famaj7
I never felt
                     Sol
The feeling that I'm feeling

Now that I don't hear your voice
Mim7                    Famaj7
 Or have your touch and kiss your lips

'Cause I don't have a choice
                    Sol
Oh, what I wouldn't give

To have you lying by my side
Mim7        Famaj7
Right here, cause baby

(We belong together)

Famaj7          Sol              Mim7
When you left I lost a part of me
     Famaj7
It's still so hard to believe
     Sol
Come back baby, please
       Mim7        Famaj7
'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on
           Sol
When times get rough
                    Mim7
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
             Famaj7
Till the sun comes up

Who's gonna take your place
                Sol
There ain't nobody better
               Mim7        Famaj7
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

        Famaj7
I can't sleep at night
Sol
When you are on my mind
      Mim7              Famaj7
Bobby Womack's on the radio

Saying to me
                         Sol
"If you think you're lonely now"

Wait a minute

This is too deep (too deep)

I gotta change the station
    Famaj7
So I turn the dial
Sol
Trying to catch a break
    Mim7           Famaj7
And then I hear Babyface

I only think of you
Sol
And it's breaking my heart
              Mim7
I'm trying to keep it together
    Famaj7
But I'm falling apart
                             Sol
I'm feeling all out of my element

I'm throwing things, crying
Mim7
Trying to figure out
Famaj7
Where the hell I went wrong

The pain reflected in this song
                      Sol
It ain't even half of what

I'm feeling inside

I need you
Mim7             Famaj7
Need you back in my life, baby

Famaj7          Sol              Mim7
When you left I lost a part of me
     Famaj7
It's still so hard to believe
     Sol
Come back baby, please
       Mim7        Famaj7
'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on
           Sol
When times get rough
                    Mim7
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
             Famaj7
Till the sun comes up

Who's gonna take your place
                Sol
There ain't nobody better
               Mim7        Famaj7
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

Famaj7          Sol              Mim7
When you left I lost a part of me
     Famaj7
It's still so hard to believe
     Sol
Come back baby, please
       Mim7        Famaj7
'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on
           Sol
When times get rough
                    Mim7
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
             Famaj7
Till the sun comes up

Who's gonna take your place
                Sol
There ain't nobody better
               Mim7        Famaj7    Sol  Mim7  Famaj7
Oh, baby baby, we belong together
