            Re        Sol
and build a lego house
               Re            Mim                Re
when things go wrong we can knock it down
Sol                       Re      Mim
    My three words have two meanings,
                  Re      Sol

         Re   Mim       Re

Sol                                           Re          Mim    Re
 And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got ya to keep me warm
Sol                                          Re            Mim
 if you're broken I'll mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm
                 Re

                     Sol/Si         Do                       Re        
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
Sol                       Re          Mim

and colour you in
             Re             Mim                        Re

Sol                    Re     Mim                       Re
    And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
Sol                      Re       Mim
   now I'll surrender up my heart
                Re
