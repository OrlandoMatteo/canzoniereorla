Re
Tell me that you turned down the man 
             La     Sim
Who asks for your hand
                      Sol    Re
Caus' you're waiting for me
Re                                      
And I know, you're gonna be away a while,
              La   Sim          Sol    Re
But I've got no plans at all to leave


               La            Sol
And would you take away my hopes and dreams 
          Mim         Sol        La
And just stay with me

Have ever been, and I'll never leave again

Another place to let their hearts collide
Sim                                   La

Take my hand and my

heart and soul I will
                 Sol       Re
Only have these eyes for you
Re
You know everything changes
                  La     Sim  
But we'll be strangers
           Sol      Re
If we see this through.


                La                 Sol
And you could stay within these walls and bleed
          Mim        Sol    La      
But just stay with me

I'm stumbling off drunk
               La
Getting myself lost
       Sim      
I am so gone,
        La           Sol
So tell me the way home
                 Re                    La
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
      
And where it goes wrong
