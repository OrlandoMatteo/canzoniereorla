Lam7           Fa        Do
Walking down 29th and Park
Lam7        Fa            Do
I saw you in another’s arms
Lam7       Fa               Do
Only a month we’ve been apart
          Lam7          Fa            Do
You look happier
Lam7        Fa            Do
Saw you walk inside a bar
Lam7            Fa                 Do 
He said something to make you laugh
Lam7          Fa                      Do
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
               Lam7     Fa            Do
Yeah, you look happier, you do


Lam7            Fa              Do
Ain’t nobody hurt you like I hurt you
     Lam7            Fa              Do
But ain’t nobody love you like I do
Lam7              Fa                Do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
Lam7               Fa               Do
If you’re moving on with someone new


                     Lam7     Fa    Do
Cause baby you look happier, you do
                    Lam7         Fa        Do
My friends told me one day I’d feel it too
                    Lam7       Fa        Do
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
                  Lam7      Fa    Do
But I know I was happier with you


Lam7          Fa             Do
Sat in the corner of the room
Lam7               Fa            Do
Everything’s reminding me of you
Lam7         Fa     Do                                Lam7
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself you’re happier
Fa      Do
Aren’t you?


Lam7            Fa              Do
Ain’t nobody hurt you like I hurt you
     Lam7            Fa              Do 
But ain’t nobody need you like I do
Lam7                  Fa              Do
I know that there’s others that deserve you
        Lam7            Fa                  Do
But my darling, I am still in love with you


                     Lam7     Fa     Do
But I guess you look happier, you do
                       Lam7     Fa          Do
My friends told me one day I’ll  feel it too
                Lam7       Fa         Do
I could try to smile to hide the truth
                 Lam7     Fa      Do
But I know I was happier with you

Lam7   Fa    Do     x4


                Lam7    Fa     Do
Baby, you look happier, you do
                     Lam7       Fa       Do
I knew one day you’d fall for someone new
                      Lam7        Fa       Do
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
                       Lam7        Fa       Do
Just know that I’ll be waiting here for you</pre>]
