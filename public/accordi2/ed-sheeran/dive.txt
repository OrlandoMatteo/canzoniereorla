Well maybe I came on too strong
        Lam              Fa  Sol 
Maybe I waited too long
        Do
Maybe I played my cards wrong, oh just a little bit wrong
     Lam  Fa
Baby I --- apologize for it


Fa                            
   I could fall, or I could fly
Lam                       
   Here in your aeroplane
Mim
   And I could live, I could die
Fa
Hanging on the words you say
Fa                         
   And I’ve been known to give my all
Lam
   And jumping in harder than
Sol
Ten thousand rocks on the lake


                 Do
So don’t call me baby
           Lam      Fa
Unless you mean it

If you don’t believe it

So let me know the truth

I have travelled the world and there’s no other girl like you, no one
            Do
What’s your history?
                                    Lam 
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
         Fa            Sol
‘Cause I heard you do, mmm-mmm


Fa

Hanging on the words you say

Don't know how much I can take

Every mess that I've made
