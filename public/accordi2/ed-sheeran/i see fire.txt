              Lam     Do
If this is to end in fire,
              Sol        Rem
Then we shall all burn together,
          Lam           Do
Watch the flames climb higher,
Sol        Rem
Into the night.
        Lam        Do
Calling out father oh,
Sol            Fa
Stand by and we will,
          Rem          Mim
Watch the flames burn auburn on
    Fa       Sol
The mountainside,

Lam    Fa    Sol    Lam


                 Lam    Do
And if we should die tonight,
          Sol       Rem
We should all die together.
        Lam       Do
Raise a glass of wine,
Sol       Rem
For the last time.
        Lam         Do
Calling out father oh,
   Sol         Fa
Prepare as we will,
          Rem          Mim
Watch the flames burn auburn on
    Fa       Sol
The mountainside.
   Rem      Mim             Fa         Sol
Desolation comes upon the sky.


          Lam     Fa
Now I see fire,
Sol          Lam
Inside the mountain.
      Lam        Fa
I see fire,
Sol           Lam
Burning the trees.
          Lam     Fa
And I see fire,
Sol         Lam
Hollowing souls.
      Lam      Fa
I see fire,
Sol            Rem
Blood in the breeze.

And I’ll hope that you’ll remember me.

Lam    Fa    Sol    Lam


             Lam     Do
Oh should my people fall then,
       Sol       Rem
Surely I’ll do the same.
            Lam       Do
Confined in mountain halls,
           Sol            Rem
We got too close to the flame.
        Lam         Do
Calling out father oh,
Sol                Fa
Hold fast and we will,
          Rem          Mim
Watch the flames burn auburn on
    Fa       Sol
The mountainside.
   Rem      Mim             Fa         Sol
Desolation comes upon the sky.

          Lam     Fa
Now I see fire,
Sol          Lam
Inside the mountain.
      Lam        Fa
I see fire,
Sol           Lam
Burning the trees.
          Lam     Fa
And I see fire,
Sol         Lam
Hollowing souls.
      Lam      Fa
I see fire,

           Rem       Lam
And if the night is burning,
       Do        Sol
I will cover my eyes,
           Rem      Lam
For if the dark returns,
        Do             Sol
Then my brothers will die.
           Rem             Lam
And as the sky is falling down,
             Do              Sol
It crashed into this lonely town.
              Rem              Do
And with that shadow upon the ground,
          Fa                Sol
I hear my people screaming out.


          Lam     Fa
And, I see fire,
Sol          Lam
Inside the mountain.
      Lam        Fa
I see fire,
Sol           Lam
Burning the trees.
          Lam     Fa
And I see fire,
Sol         Lam
Hollowing souls.
      Lam      Fa
I see fire,
Sol            Lam
Blood in the breeze.
      Lam
I see fire,
        Fa                 Sol
(Oh you know I saw a city burning.)
Lam
Fire.
          Lam
And I see fire
          Fa              Sol
(Feel the heat upon my skin.)
Lam
Fire.
          Lam
And I see fire,
      Fa          Sol

Fire.
