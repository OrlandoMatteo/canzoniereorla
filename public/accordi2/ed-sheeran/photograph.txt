Loving can hurt
           Sim
Loving can hurt sometimes
             La                          Sol 
But it's the only thing that I know
             Re
When it gets hard
                    Sim
You know it can get hard sometimes
          La                                 Sol
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive


Sim                      Sol
We keep this love in a photograph
Re                       La
We make these memories for ourselves
          Sim           
Where our eyes are never closing
     Sol
Our hearts were never broken
     Re                         La
And times forever frozen still

So you can keep me inside the pocket of your
La
Ripped jeans holding me closer till our
Sim                             Sol
Eyes meet, you won't ever be alone
                         Re
Wait for me to come home

Loving can heal
           Sim
Loving can mend your soul

And it's the only thing that I know
                    Re
I swear it will get easier
                           Sim
remember that with every piece of ya
             La                                   Sol
It is the only thing we take with us when we die

And if you hurt me that's okay baby, only
La 
Words bleed inside these pages you just
Sim                              Sol
Hold me, and I won't ever let you go

Oh you can fit me, inside the necklace you got when you were
La           
16 next to your heartbeat where I 
Sim                                    Sol
Should be, keep it deep within your soul.

When I'm away I will remember how you
La                                      Sim
Kissed me under the lamp post back on sixth street 
                                 Sol
Hearing you whisper through the phone,
Sol N.C.
Wait for me to come home.</pre>]
