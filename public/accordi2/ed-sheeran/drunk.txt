I wanna be drunk when I wake up
                  Re/Fa#     Mim
On the right side of the wrong bed

And every excuse I made up

Tell you the truth I hate
      Do
What didn't kill me
                          Re   Sol
It never made me stronger at all.

Sol
Love will scar your make-up lip sticks to me
             Re/Fa#       Mim
So now I'll maybe leave back there
                                  Do
I'm sat here wishing I was sober
                                     Re   Sol
I know I'll never hold you like I used to.


         Mim                       Re
But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
 Sol                             Do
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Mim                Re
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
Sol                                 Do
'Cause you take part of it every evening
Mim                        Re
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Sol                                      Do       Sol
Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me.

       Re/La        Do
Should I, should I?


               Mim       Sol
Maybe I'll get drunk again
       Mim        Sol
I'll be drunk again
       Mim        Sol
I'll be drunk again
                  Do  Re
To feel a little love


Sol
I wanna hold your heart in both hands
                                         Re/Fa#    Mim
I'll watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can

And I've got no plans for the weekend

So shall we speak then
                        Do
Keep it between friends
                                               Re   Sol
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to.

Sol
There maybe other people like us
                                            Re/Fa#   Mim
You see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
                                                Do
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
                         Re  Sol
You don't hold me anymore.


    Mim                     Re
On cold days Coldplay's out like the band's the name
Sol                  Do
I know I can't heal things with a hand shake
 Mim                     Re
You know I can't change as I began saying
Sol                  Do
You cut me wide open like landscape
Mim                Re
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
Sol                            Do             Sol
We'll applaud you with the sound that my hands make.

       Re/La        Do
Should I, should I?


               Mim       Sol
Maybe I'll get drunk again
       Mim        Sol
I'll be drunk again
       Mim        Sol
I'll be drunk again
                 Do  Re
To feel a little love


Mim         Sol
All by myself

I'm here again
Mim         Sol
All by myself

You know I'll never change
Mim         Sol
All by myself
Do       Re   Mim
All by myself
         Mim      Sol
I'm just drunk again
         Mim      Sol
I'll be drunk again
         Mim      Sol
I'll be drunk again
                  Do  Re
To feel a little love</pre>]
