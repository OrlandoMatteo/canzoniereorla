Sol#m7         Mi           Si5  Simaj7 
 Give me love, like her
Sol#m7            Mi                   Si5  Simaj7 
 Cos lately I've been waking up alone
Sol#m7             Mi                      Si5  Simaj7  
The pain splatter tear drops on my shirt
Sol#m7             Mi          Si5  Simaj7
I told you I'd let them go


             Do#m
And that I'll fight my corner
        Mi
Maybe tonight I'll call you
         Si                    Fa#
After my blood, turns into alcohol
Do#m                     Mi
No, I just wanna hold you


Si             Do#m       Mi
Give a little time to me (We'll burn this out)
Si          Do#m        Mi
We'll play hide and seek (To turn this around)
Si         Do#m           Mi
And all I want is the taste that your lips allow


Sol#m     Fa#    Mi

Sol#m7         Mi           Si5  Simaj7   
Give me love like never before
Sol#m7         Mi           Si5 Simaj7  
Cos lately I've been craving more
Sol#m7               Mi                           Si5  Simaj7  
And It's been a while but I still feel the same
Sol#m7          Mi           Si5 Simaj7
Maybe I should let you go


             Do#m
You know I'll fight my corner,
        Mi
And that tonight I'll call you
