   Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooooh, ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooooh
 

Sim                      Remaj7                   Solsus2
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Sim                        Remaj7                 Solsus2
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
Sim                     Remaj7              Solsus2   
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
      Sim            Remaj7      (Mim7)
And tonight had something wonderful
 
 
                      Sim                      Remaj7
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
                     Solsus2
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
         La                Sim                        Remaj7
Swearin' this will be the last but it probably won't
                      Mim7              Sol
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
 
                      Sim                        Remaj7
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
                        Solsus2
And I know I'll lose control of the things that I say
           La             Sim                         Remaj7
Yeah I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
                      Mim7
Nothin' happens after two, it's true
     Sol                          Sim
It's true my bad habits lead to you

My bad habits lead to you

Sim                     Remaj7                 Solsus2
Ev–µry pure intention ends when the good times start
Sim                   Remaj7                       Solsus2
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
   Sim                   Remaj7                   Solsus2
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
  Sim       Remaj7          Mim7
I only know how to go too far

And burned 'til the fun    ran  out, now
