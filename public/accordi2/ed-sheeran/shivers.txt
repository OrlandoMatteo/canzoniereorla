I took an arrow to the heart
                              Fa
I never kissed a mouth that taste like yours
                   Do
Strawberries and something more
                      Sol
Ooh, yeah, I want it all

                 Lam
Lipstick on my guitar, ooh
                             Fa
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
                  Do
Go dancing underneath the stars
                     Sol
Ooh, yeah I want it all, mmm... you got me feeling like

Lam
 I wanna be that guy I wanna kiss your eyes
Fa
 I wanna drink that smile I wanna feel like I’m
Do
 Like my soul’s on fire
                     Sol
I wanna stay up all day and all night, 
yeah, you got me singing like

Lam
Ooh, I love when you do it like that
                  Fa
And when you're closer, give me the shivers
          Do
Oh, baby you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
          Sol
And when they say the party's over then 
we'll bring it right back and we'll say

         Lam                           Fa
Into the car, on the backseat of the moonlit dark
                         Do
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
                   Sol
oOh, I can't get enough
                            Lam
You know you could tear me apart
                          Fa
Put me back together and take my heart
                              Do
I never thought that I could love this hard
                  Sol

Oh, baby, you burn so hot you make me shiver
