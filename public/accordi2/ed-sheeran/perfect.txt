Darling, just dive right in, and follow my lead

Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet
        Do                                     Re
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
            Mim                      Do                Sol  Re
Not knowing what it was, I will not give you up this ti-ime
             Sol                           Mim
Darling just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
            Do                     Re
And in your eyes you're holding mine


      Mim   Do             Sol          Re              Mim
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Do                Sol     Re                Mim
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
          Do                Sol                 Re              Mim
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
         Do                Sol        Re             Sol
But you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight

I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets

To carry love, to carry children of our own


                             Sol                     Mim
We are still kids, but we're so in love, fighting against all odds

I see my future in your eyes


      Mim   Do              Sol         Re              Mim
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Do                Sol     Re                Mim
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
        Do                Sol                Re
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
