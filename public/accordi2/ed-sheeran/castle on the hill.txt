  And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as I rolled down

  I was younger  then,  take me back to when I

  Found my heart and broke it here

  Made friends and lost them through the years
Sol               La                Re                  Sol
  And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
Sol              La
  But I can't wait to go home

  I'm on my   way, driving at ninety

  Down those country  lanes singing to Tiny Dancer

  Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes

  Running from the law through the backfields and  getting drunk with my friends
Re        Re/Fa#   Sol                Sim             La
  Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon I did it

  Weekend jobs and when we got paid

  We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
