[<pre>One, two

Sol
 Stop the clocks, it's amazing
Doadd9
 You should see the way the light dances off your hair
Resus2                  Mim7              Doadd9
 A million colours of hazel, golden and red
Sol
 Saturday morning is fading
Doadd9
 The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
Resus2                         Mim7          Doadd9
  My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again

        Doadd9
We were love drunk, waiting on a miracle
           Sol                    Resus2
Trying to find ourselves in the winter snow
   Doadd9                                   Sol    Resus2
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
      Doadd9
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
        Sol                        Resus2
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
          Doadd9                                     Sol    Resus2
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears

           Doadd9                Sol    Resus2
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
           Doadd9                Sol
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow

Sol
 The weather outside's changing
Doadd9
 The leaves are buried under six inches of white
Resus2           Mim7           Doadd9
 The radio is playing, Iron &amp; Wine
Sol
 This is a new dimension
Doadd9
 This is a level where we're losing track of time
Resus2                  Mim7                      Doadd9
 I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I

        Doadd9
We were love drunk, waiting on a miracle
           Sol                     Resus2
Trying to find ourselves in the winter snow
   Doadd9                                   Sol    Resus2
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
      Doadd9
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
       Sol                         Resus2
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
          Doadd9                                     Sol     Resus2
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears

           Doadd9                   Sol   Resus2
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
           Doadd9                   Sol   Resus2
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
           Doadd9   N.C.
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow</pre>]
