[<pre>Sol     Sol   Re Mim   Do Sol


Sol
White lips, pale face
               Re   Mim
Breathing in snowflakes
              Do    Sol
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Sol
Light's gone, day's end
              Re    Mim
Struggling to pay rent
                Do    Sol
Long nights, strange men


      Lam
And they say
                   Do
She's in the Class A Team
               Sol
Stuck in her daydream
                    Re
Been this way since 18
                Lam
But lately her face seems
                 Do
Slowly sinking, wasting
                Sol
Crumbling like pastries

And they scream
     Re
The worst things in life come free to us


            Mim            Do
Cos we're just under the upperhand
Sol
And go mad for a couple of grams
Mim                    Do      Sol
And she don't want to go outside tonight
          Mim                    Do
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Sol
Or sells love to another man
Mim        Do       Sol
It's too cold outside
              Mim  Do  Sol
For angels to fly
           Mim  Do  Sol
Angels to fly


Sol
Ripped gloves, raincoat
                    Re     Mim
Tried to swim and stay afloat
            Do   Sol
Dry house, wet clothes
Sol
Loose change, bank notes
             Re   Mim
Weary-eyed, dry throat
           Do    Sol
Call girl, no phone


      Lam
And they say
                   Do
She's in the Class A Team
              Sol

It's too cold outside
              Lam
For angels to fly


Lam             Do
An angel will die
             Mim
Covered in white

Closed eye
         Sol
And hoping for a better life
Lam                         Do
This time, we'll fade out tonight
                  Mim Do Sol
Straight down the line


      Lam
And they say
                   Do
She's in the Class A Team

Angels to fly
   Mim Do  Sol
To fly, fly
           Mim      Do       Sol
Angels to fly, to fly, to fly
   Re       Sol
Angels to die</pre>]
