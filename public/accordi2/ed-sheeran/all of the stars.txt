[<pre>Doadd9                 Sol          Mim  Re   Doadd9       
It's just another night, and I'm staring at the Moon,
Sol                          Re             
I saw a shooting star and thought of you.
Doadd9           Sol       Mim Re  Doadd9         
I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew, 
Sol                     Re          
If you were here I'd sing to you.
Doadd9                  Sol        Mim  Re   Doadd9         
You're on the other side as the skyline splits in two,
Sol                Re          
Miles away from seeing you.
Doadd9                Sol         Mim   Re   Doadd9     
But I can see the stars from Amer - i - ca
Sol                Re
I wonder do you see them too.


              Sol
So open your eyes and see,
               Re
The way our horizons meet.
                Mim
And all of the lights will lead,
          Doadd9
Into the night with me.
                  Sol
And I know these scars will bleed,
                 Re
But both of our hearts believe,
              Mim   Doadd9 Sol    Re  Sol
All of these stars will guide us home.


Doadd9                Sol       Mim    Re  Doadd9  
I can hear your heart on the ra - di - o    beats,
Sol                                     Re            
They're playing 'Chasing Cars' and I thought of us.
Doadd9           Sol         Mim  Re Doadd9
Back to the time you were lying next to me,
Sol                    Re            
I looked across and fell in love.
Doadd9              Sol             Mim    Re  Doadd9
So I took your hand back through lamp lit streets I knew,
Sol               Re           
Everything led back to you.
Doadd9                 Sol       Mim     Re    Doadd9
So can you see the stars over Am - ster - dam?
Sol                          Re             
Hear the song my heart is beating to.


              Sol
So open your eyes and see,
               Re
The way our horizons meet.
                Mim
And all of the lights will lead,
          Doadd9
Into the night with me.
                  Sol
And I know these scars will bleed,
                 Re
But both of our hearts believe,
              Mim   Doadd9 Sol    Re  Sol
All of these stars will guide us home.


 Doadd9 Re    Mim Sol
And,  oh,   I know,       
 Doadd9 Re    Mim Sol
And   oh,  I know,
Doadd9            Sol         Mim   Re   Doadd9
I can see the stars from Amer - i - ca</pre>]
