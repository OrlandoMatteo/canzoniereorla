The club isn't the best place to find a lover so the bar is where I go
Sim                       Mim                           Sol                      La
Me and my friends at the table doing shots, drinking fast and then we talk slow

I may be crazy, don't mind me, say

Boy, let's not talk too much
Sol                    La                Sim
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
