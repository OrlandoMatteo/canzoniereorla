Settle down with me, and cover me up, cuddle me in.
         La  Sim         La Sol     Sol Re
Lie down with me and, and hold me, in your arms.


Sol                               La                             Re
And your heart's against my chest, your lips pressed to my neck.
                          Sim                          Sol
And I'm falling for your eyes, but they don't know me yet.
                                  La
And with this feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now

Settle down with me, and I'll be your safety, and you'll be my lady.

I was made, to keep your body warm
La Sol                              Re
But I'm cold as the wind blows, so hold me in your arms

Oh no, my hearts against your chest, your lips pressed to my neck.
                          Sim                          Sol
And I'm falling for your eyes, but they don't know me yet,
                                La
And with this feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now

Yeah I've been feeling, everything, from hate to love from love to lust from lust to truth
  La                Sol                   Solm
I guess that's how I know you, so I'll hold you, close, to help you give it up
