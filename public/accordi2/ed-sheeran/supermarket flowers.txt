            Do             Mim                  Fa
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
            Do         Mim             Fa
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Lam                Sol          Fa       Rem7      Do
   Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
    Fa           Sol                    Do
Memories of a life that’s been loved

            Do            Mim              Fa
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
           Do            Mim               Fa
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Lam            Sol                 Fa        Rem7    Do
   Dad always told me don’t you cry when you’re down
                  Fa          Sol                 Do
But mum there’s a tear every time that I blink


Rem            Fa              Do         Sol
   Oh I’m in pieces, it’s tearing me up but I know
Rem                Fa            Do                     Sol
   A heart that’s broke is a heart that’s been loved


             Do          Mim   Fa
So I’ll sing Hallelujah 
            Sol            Do               Mim   Fa
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
            Sol
When I fell down you’d be there
Lam            Fa              Do            Sol
Holding me up, spread your wings as you go 
          Lam                Fa           Do         Sol    
And when God takes you back, he’ll say Hallelujah, you’re home
Do  Mim  Fa   Sol
Do  Mim  Fa


                 Do               Mim                     Fa
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
            Do            Mim             Fa
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
Sol Lam                Sol                  Fa                Do
     John said he’d drive then put his hand on my cheek
            Fa              Sol          Do
And wiped a tear from the side of my face


Rem                 Fa          Do              Sol
   And I hope that I see the world as you did cause I know
Rem             Fa           Do                    Sol
   A life with love is a life that’s been lived


             Do          Mim   Fa
So I’ll sing Hallelujah 
            Sol            Do               Mim   Fa
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
            Sol
When I fell down you’d be there
Lam            Fa              Do            Sol
Holding me up, spread your wings as you go 
          Lam                Fa           Do         Sol     
And when God takes you back, he’ll say Hallelujah, you’re home


Do   Mim  Fa
Ooh ooh ooh
Do   Mim  Fa
Ooh ooh ooh
Do   Mim  Fa
Ooh ooh ooh
Lam  Sol   Fa 
Ooh ooh ooh


Do          Mim   Faadd9
Hallelujah 
                         Do               Mim   Faadd9
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
                          Lam           
You got to see the person I have become, 
Fa               Do            Sol
spread your wings and I know that when
 Lam               Fa         Do         Sol            Do
God took you back, he said Hallelujah, you’re home</pre>]
