Re/Fa#                                  Sol             La

I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
 Mim                       La
Maybe just the touch of a hand
 Mim                              La         Sim
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day

And I just wanna tell you I am

And the crowds don't remember my name

When my hands don’t play the strings the same way

I know you will still love me the same

Oh I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
