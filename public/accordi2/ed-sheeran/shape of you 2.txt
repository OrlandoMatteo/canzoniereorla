       Do#m  Fa#m7  La  Si

    Do#m                Fa#m7
The club isn’t the best place to find a lover
       La              Si
So the bar is where I go
Do#m                     Fa#m7
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
         La                       Si
Drinking faster and then we talk slow
     Do#m                      Fa#m7
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
    La                        Si
And trust me I’ll give it a chance now
        Do#m
Take my hand, stop
            Fa#m7
Put Van The Man on the jukebox
    La                Si
And then we start to dance

And now I’m singing like
Do#m             Fa#m7
Girl, you know I want your love
La                     Si                Do#m
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
             Fa#m7
Come on now, follow my lead
La              Si
I may be crazy, don’t mind me
     Do#m
Say, boy, let’s not talk too much
La                                    Do#m
Grab on my waist and put that body on me

Come on now, follow my lead
      La
Come, come on now, follow my lead

Do#m     Fa#m7                  La
  I’m in love with the shape of you
            Si                 Do#m
We push and pull like a magnet do
            Fa#m7            La
Although my heart is falling too
       Si                Do#m
I’m in love with your body
         Fa#m7                 La
And last night you were in my room
           Si                   Do#m
And now my bedsheets smell like you
                 Fa#m7                La
Every day discovering something brand new
       Si
I’m in love with your body
Do#m      Fa#m7      La
Oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i

Do#m                   Fa#m7
One week in we let the story begin
            La               Si
We’re going out on our first date
        Do#m
You and me are thrifty
       Fa#m7
So go all you can eat
             La
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
            Do#m                      Fa#m7
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
             La               Si
And how your family is doing okay
          Do#m                Fa#m7
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
         La                    Si
Tell the driver make the radio play
And now I’m singing like
Do#m             Fa#m7
Girl, you know I want your love
La                     Si                Do#m
