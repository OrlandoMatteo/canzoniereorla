[<pre>          Lam
Ooh I'm a mess right now
       Sol
Inside out
                Do
Searching for a sweet surrender
    Fa               Do
But this is not the end
        Lam
I can't work it out
  Sol
How?
                  Do
Going through the motions
Fa               Sol
Going through us


    Fa                                Do
And oh I've known it for the longest time
              Sol            Fa
And all of my hopes all my words
                            Do
Are all over written on the signs
                 Sol               Fa
But you're on my road walking me home
Home, home


Lam                         Sol
  See the flames inside my eyes
            Fa                        Do        Lam
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, nooo
                      Sol
Easy baby maybe I'm a liar
          Fa                     Do
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
             Rem          Fa
And put your faith in my-y stomach


         Lam
I messed up this time
          Sol
Late last night
            Do
Drinking to suppress devotion
     Fa            Do
With fingers intertwined
        Lam
I can't shake this feeling
   Sol
No-ow
                        Do
We're going through the motions
Fa            Sol
Hopin' you'd stop


    Fa
And oh I've only caused you pain
  Do                  Sol
I know but all of my words
              Fa
Will always below
                        Do
Although all the lie we spoke
                  Sol               Fa
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home

It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, nooo

Easy baby maybe I'm a liar
          Fa                     Do
But for tonight I wanna fall in love

And put your faith in my-y stomach
