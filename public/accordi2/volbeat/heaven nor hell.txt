Well, I've heard that the devil's walking around
          Re#
I sold my soul way down in the dirt
             Sol#       Re#     La#
But stole it back and forever in debt
          Re#
And for a moment I don't even care
        Sol#      Re#       La#
Until I feel his breath at my neck
          Re#
And maybe even you can feel it too
          Sol#        Re#     La#
He's on a strike and looking at you

Sol#               La#
 Holding onto his words, but baby
Re#               Sol#
 I saw an angel become the devil
                       La#           Re#
Still they walk pretty good hand in hand
              Sol#
Well baby, I don't need any of them
        La#
Heaven nor hell

Well, I've heard that the morning star of a prince
      Re#
Was invoked on a Monday on earth
            Sol#      Re#     La#
I found his business card in the mud
          Re#
And for a moment I don't even care

Evil came down on earth
         Re#               Sol#
And it beholds more than you love
