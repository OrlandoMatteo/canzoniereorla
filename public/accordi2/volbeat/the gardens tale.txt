 Do
 Time keeps painting my darling

 Ripped all the flowers in the garden
Fa            Do
 Oh baby come home
Fa                    Do
 you angels bring her home

 Do
 Imens står solen over højen

 Han mindes den sommer hvor hun strålede
Fa                 Do
 Forsvandt i haven gron
Fa                    Do
 og træernes sang hun fandt

Do
Time keeps painting my darling
        Fa                              Do
And the garden keeps on singing the old song
        Lam    Sol           Fa
Oh baby still I am waiting in the light
     Do           Sol       Do
Hoping the angels would carry you home

    Do
Den sang tog mørket i sin pote
    Fa                          Do
Den bar hans kvinde i dens kolde favn
   Lam       Sol              Fa
Og lagde hende for hans dør i silkekjole
     Do         Sol   Do
Hoping the angels would carry you home

     Fa             Sol
Leaving it all with my only friend
         Do        Fa
Her beauty was lifeless on the stair
                 Sol
Oh baby I´ll carry you away
   Do
into the garden´s tale
                     Fa                 Sol
But everything (had) died and turned to stones
     Do               Fa
I laid her down under the old oak
       Sol
Seing it all
    Do
blossom forever more

Lam   Fa  Sol    Lam   Fa  Sol

Do
 Time keep on painting my darling
  Fa                         Do
And the garden keeps on singing the old song
  Lam    Sol         Fa
Oh baby now I know you´re in the light
      Do           Sol    Do
Painting it all with your colorful songs

 Do
Imens står solen over højen
     Fa                     Do
Hans skygge kastes ud i haven grøn
        Lam      Sol     Fa
Forsvandt for evigt og uden en note
     Do         Sol   Do
Hoping the angels would carry you home

     Fa             Sol
Leaving it all with my only friend
         Do         Fa
Her beauty was lifeless on the stair
                 Sol
Oh baby I´ll carry you away
   Do
into the garden´s tale
         Fa                  Sol
But everything died and turned to stones
     Do               Fa
I laid her down under the old oak
        Sol
Seing it all
    Do
blossom forever more

Lam   Fa  Sol    Lam   Fa  Sol   Do

Do
Time keeps painting my darling

Ripped all the flowers in the garden
Fa         Do
 Oh baby you´re home
Fa               Do
 you angels where are you
