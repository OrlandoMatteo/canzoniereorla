       La5 Fa5    Do5 Sol5  La5 Fa5   Do5 Sol5

La5             Fa5      Do5          Sol5
 I wrote her off for the tenth time today
La5               Fa5  Do5            Sol5
 And practiced all the things I would say
La5           Fa5    Do5       Sol5
 But she came over I lost my nerve
La5             Fa5  Do5      Sol5
 I took her back and made her dessert
   La5 Fa5 Do5            Sol5
Oh I  know I'm being used
La5             Fa5      Do5            Sol5
 That's okay man cause I like the abuse
La5   Fa5        Do5            Sol5
 Oh I know she's playing with me
La5          Fa5            Do5            Sol5
 That's okay cause I've got no self esteem

La5 Fa5   Do5 Sol5
 Oh...    yeah...

La5      Fa5      Do5        Sol5
 We make plans to go out at night
La5          Fa5      Do5          Sol5
 I wait till 2 then I turn out the light
La5         Fa5   Do5        Sol5
 This rejection's got me so low
La5              Fa5       Do5            Sol5
 If she keeps it up I just might tell her so

La5 Fa5   Do5 Sol5
Oh...     yeah...

Re5         La#5    Fa5          Do5        Re5
 When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me
       La#5           Fa5            Do5
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
Re5         La#5    Fa5          Do5        Re5
 When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease
       La#5            Fa5        Do5
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Re5     La#5  Fa5            Do5      Re5
 Well I guess I should stick up for myself
      La#5              Fa5         Do5  Re5
But I really think it's better this way
             La#5
The more you suffer
Do5          Sol5             Fa5
 The more it shows you really care

Right?

Sol5    La5 Fa5   Do5 Sol5
Yeah-eh-eh

La5         Fa5  Do5         Sol5
 Now I'll relate this little bit
La5            Fa5      Do5        Sol5
 That happens more than I'd like to admit
La5       Fa5      Do5          Sol5
 Late at night she knocks on my door
La5             Fa5    Do5         Sol5
 She's drunk again and looking to score
La5             Fa5      Do5        Sol5
 Oh I know I should say no but
La5             Fa5      Do5        Sol5
 It's kind of hard when she's ready to go
La5          Fa5    Do5       Sol5
 I may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb
La5          Fa5        Do5       Sol5
 I'm just a sucker with no self esteem

La5 Fa5   Do5 Sol5
Oh...     yeah...

Re5        La#5     Fa5           Do5       Re5
When she's saying, oh, that she wants only me
