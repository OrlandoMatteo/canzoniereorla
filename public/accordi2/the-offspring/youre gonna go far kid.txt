Lam
Show me how to lie
               Fa
You're getting better all the time
            Do
And turning all against the one
      Sol
Is an art that's hard to teach
 Lam
Another clever word
            Fa
Sets off an unsuspecting herd
           Do
And as you step back into line
  Sol
A mob jumps to their feet
    Lam
Now dance, fucker, dance Man,
   Fa
he never had a chance
    Do
And no one even knew
       Sol
It was really only you
            Fa
And now you steal away

Take him out today
     Fa
Nice work you did
                Mi         Sol
You're gonna go far, kid

       Lam
With a thousand lies
      Fa
And a good disguise
        Do
Hit 'em right between the eyes
        Sol
Hit 'em right between the eyes
         Lam
When you walk away
        Fa
Nothing more to say
        Do
See the lightning in your eyes
        Sol               Lam
See 'em running for their lives

Lam
Slowly out of line
             Fa
And drifting closer in your sights
           Do
So play it out I'm wide awake
       Sol
It's a scene about me
        Lam
There's something in your way
            Fa
And now someone is gonna pay
           Do
And if you can't get what you want
          Sol
Well it's all because of me
    Lam
Now dance, fucker, dance
       Fa
Man, I never had a chance
    Do
And no one even knew
       Sol
It was really only you
               Fa
And now you'll lead the way
         Rem
Show the light of day
     Fa
Nice work you did
                Mi
You're gonna go far, kid
Sol
