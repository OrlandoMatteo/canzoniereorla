    Sol#m11
You must understand

Though the touch of your hand
         Fa#/Sol#
Makes my pulse react
          Sol#m11
That it's only the thrill

Of boy meeting girl
    Fa#/Sol#
Opposites attract
     Mi   Fa#
It's physical
     Mi  Fa#
Only logical
         Mi
You must try to ignore
        Fa#
That it means more than that

Si        Sol#m7 Fa#    Mi         Fa#
Oh what's love   got to do, got to do with it
Si      Fa#        Mi             Fa#
 What's love but a second hand emotion
Si      Sol#m7 Fa#    Mi         Fa#
 What's love   got to do, got to do with it
Si          Fa#
Who needs a heart
       Mi           Fa#
When a heart can be broken

   Sol#m11
It may seem to you

That I'm acting confused
            Fa#/Sol#
When you're close to me
     Sol#m11
If I tend to look dazed

I've read it someplace
         Fa#/Sol#
I've got cause to be
          Mi       Fa#
There's a name for it
          Mi          Fa#
There's a phrase that fits
       Mi
But whatever the reason
    Fa#
You do it for me

Si        Sol#m7 Fa#    Mi         Fa#
Oh what's love   got to do, got to do with it
Si      Fa#        Mi             Fa#
 What's love but a second hand emotion
Si      Sol#m7 Fa#    Mi         Fa#
 What's love   got to do, got to do with it
Si          Fa#
Who needs a heart
       Mi           Fa#
When a heart can be broken

Do#  La#m7 Sol# Fa#  Sol#   Do#  Sol# Fa#  Sol#

Do#  La#m7 Sol# Fa#  Sol#   Do#  Sol# Fa#  Sol#

Si/Do#                 Do#
 I've been taking on a new direction
Si/Do#         Do#
 But I have to say

Laadd9                       Si/La
 I've been thinking about my own protection
   Sol#m7                 Do#
It scares me to feel this way

Do#       La#m7 Sol#    Fa#        Sol#
Oh what's love   got to do, got to do with it
Do#     Sol#       Fa#            Sol#
 What's love but a second hand emotion
Do#     La#m7  Sol#   Fa#        Sol#
 What's love   got to do, got to do with it
Do#         Sol#
Who needs a heart
       Fa#          Sol#
When a heart can be broken
Do#       La#m7 Sol#    Fa#        Sol#
Oh what's love   got to do, got to do with it
Do#     Sol#       Fa#            Sol#
 What's love but a second hand emotion
Do#     La#m7  Sol#   Fa#        Sol#
 What's love   got to do, got to do with it
Do#         Sol#
Who needs a heart
       Fa#          Sol#
When a heart can be broken...
