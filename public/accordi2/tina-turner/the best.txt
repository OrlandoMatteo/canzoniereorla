Fa
I call you when I need you, my heart's on fire

You come to me, come to me wild and wired
                 Rem
When you come to me
                   La#
Give me everything I need
           Fa
Give me a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams

Speak the language of love like you know what it means
                 Rem
ohh, it can't be wrong
                          La#            Do
Take my heart and make it stronger baby

                    Fa
You're simply the best, better than all the rest
            Rem                 Do
Better than anyone, anyone I've ever met
                  Fa
I'm stuck on your heart, I hang on every word you say
         Rem                Do
Tear us apart, baby I would rather be dead

         Fa
In your heart I see the stars of every night and every day

In your eyes I get lost, I get washed away
        Rem
Just as long as I'm here in your arms
                La#            Do
I could be in no better place

                     Fa
You're simply the best, better than all the rest
            Rem7                Do
Better than anyone, anyone I've ever met
                  Fa
I'm stuck on your heart, and hang on every word you say
         Rem7               Do
Tear us apart, baby I would rather be dead

La#
 Each time you leave me I start losing control
       Rem
You're walking away with my heart and my soul
La#
 I can feel you even when I'm alone
Do                  Re
 Oh baby, don't let go

Sol    Mim7    Re

             Sol
You're the best, better than all the rest
            Mim7                Re
Better than anyone, anyone I've ever met
                  Sol
I'm stuck on your heart, and hang on every word you say
         Mim7               Re
Tear us apart, baby I would rather be dead
                Sol
Oh, You're the best...
