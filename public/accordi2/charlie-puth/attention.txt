You've been running round, running round, 
                            Do
running round throwing that dirt all on my name
          Lam                                             La#
Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd call you up

You've been going round, going round, 
                   Do
going round every party in LA
            Lam                                           La#
Cause you knew that I, knew that I, knew that I'd be at one

I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
    Lam                                  La#
You got me thinking about when you were mine
Rem                      Do
And now I'm all up on you, what you expect
     Lam                               La#
But you're not coming home with me tonight


                Rem
You just want attention
                  Do
You don't want my heart
               Lam                                  La#
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
                     Rem
Yeah, you just want attention
                 Do
I knew from the start
                   Lam                          La#
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you

Baby, now that we're, now that we're,
