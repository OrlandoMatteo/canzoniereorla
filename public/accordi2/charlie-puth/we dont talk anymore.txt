We don't talk anymore
                  Sol
We don't talk anymore
                  Lam
We don't talk anymore
                Mim
Like we used to do
                  Fa
We don't laugh anymore
                    Sol
What was all of it for?
                      Lam
Oh, we don't talk anymore
                Sol
Like we used to do...


                 Fa
I just heard you found the one you've been looking
Sol
You've been looking for
  Lam                                   Mim
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
                 Fa
Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Sol
Why I can't move on
Lam                         Mim
Just the way you did so easily


            Fa
Don't wanna know
                                    Sol
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
                            Lam
If he's holding onto you so tight
                Mim
The way I did before
      Fa
I overdosed
                                Sol
Should've known your love was a game
                              Lam
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame


                  Fa
We don't talk anymore
                  Sol

                   Fa
I just hope you're lying next to somebody
          Sol
Who knows how to love you like me
      Lam                                 Mim
There must be a good reason that you're gone
              Fa
Every now and then I think you
                      Sol
Might want me to come show up at your door
    Lam                                Mim
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong


            Fa
Don't wanna know
                           Sol
If you're looking into her eyes
                             Lam                    Mim
If she's holding onto you so tight the way I did before
