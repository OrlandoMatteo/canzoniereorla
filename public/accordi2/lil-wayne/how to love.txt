You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Solmaj7
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
Domaj7

Dom

You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Solmaj7

Sol
For a second you were here

Why you over there?
                 Solmaj7
Its hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
                      Domaj7
Like you never had a love
              Dom
Never had a love


Sol 
When you was just a young’un your looks but so precious
Solmaj7
But now your grown up
                               Domaj7      
So fly its like a blessing but you can’t have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Dom
Without you being insecure
Sol
You never credit yourself so when you got older
      Solmaj7
It’s seems like you came back 10 times over
Domaj7
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Dom
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

Sol
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
                                 Solmaj7
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
       Domaj7
But it wasn’t your fault

Wasn’t in your intentions
              Dom
To be the one here talking to me

Be the one listening
Sol
But I admire your poppin bottles and dippin’
Solmaj7
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Domaj7
Baby, so don’t be mad

Nobody else trippin
Dom
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook
