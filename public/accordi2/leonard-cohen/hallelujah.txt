[<pre>         Sol                   Mim
Now I've heard there was a secret chord
     Sol                      Mim
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
    Do                Re                   Sol    Re                
But you don't really care for music, do you?
   Sol                  Do           Re
It goes like this the fourth, the fifth
    Mim              Do      
The minor fall, the major lift
    Re               Si7          Mim
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
     Do           Mim          Do           Sol  Re Sol  Re
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu-u-jah


     Sol                         Mim
Your faith was strong, but you needed proof
    Sol               Mim
You saw her bathing on the roof
    Do              Re             Sol        Re
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
    Sol             Do       Re
She tied you to a kitchen chair
    Mim                         Do            
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
    Re                  Si7            Mim
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
     Do           Mim          Do           Sol  Re Sol  Re
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu-u-jah


    Sol              Mim
You say I took the name in vain
Sol            Mim
I don't even know the name
    Do              Re                 Sol      Re
But if I did, well really, what's it to ya?
          Sol                 Do     Re
There's a blaze of light in every word
   Mim             Do           
It doesn't matter which you heard
    Re           Si7          Mim
The holy or the broken Hallelujah
     Do           Mim          Do           Sol  Re Sol  Re
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu-u-jah


  Sol               Mim
I did my best, it wasn't much
  Sol                   Mim
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
     Do                 Re                    Sol   Re
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya
    Sol              Do        Re
And even though it all went wrong
     Mim               Do      
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
     Re             Si7              Mim
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah


     Do           Mim          Do           Sol Re
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
     Do           Mim          Do           Sol Re
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
     Do           Mim          Do           Sol Re
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
     Do           Mim          Do           Sol Re Sol
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah</pre>]
