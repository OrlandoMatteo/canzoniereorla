        La la...
        Dom   Solm   Re7   Solm
        La la..

Dom                            Solm
Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dom                                 Solm
Dance me through the panic ’til I’m gathered safely in
Dom                              Solm
Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove
Re7                    Solm
Dance me to the end of love
Re7                    Solm
Dance me to the end of love

   Dom                             Solm
Oh let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone
Dom                              Solm
Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
Dom                        Solm
Show me slowly what I only know the limits of
Re7                    Solm
Dance me to the end of love
Re7                    Solm
Dance me to the end of love

Fa   Solm   Fa   Solm

Dom                          Solm
Dance me to the wedding now, dance me on and on
Dom                        Solm
Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
      Dom                                Solm
We’re both of us beneath our love, we’re both of us above
Re7                    Solm
Dance me to the end of love
Re7                    Solm
Dance me to the end of love

Dom                              Solm
Dance me to the children who are asking to be born
Dom                                    Solm
Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn
Dom                                 Solm
Raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn
Re7                    Solm
Dance me to the end of love

Fa   Solm   Fa   Solm

        Dom   Solm   Re7   Solm

        La la..

Dom                            Solm
Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dom                                 Solm
Dance me through the panic till I’m gathered safely in
Dom                              Solm
Touch me with your naked hand or touch me with your glove
Re7                    Solm
Dance me to the end of love
Re7                    Solm
Dance me to the end of love
Re7                    Solm
Dance me to the end of love
