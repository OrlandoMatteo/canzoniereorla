If you want a lover
                      Re
I'll do anything you ask me to
                 Mim
And if you want another kind of love
            Re
I'll wear a mask for you
              Mim
If you want a partner

Take my hand
                  Sol
Or if you want to strike me down in anger
La                        Sim
   Here I stand  I'm your man

              Mim
If you want a boxer

I will step into the ring for you
                  Mim
And if you want a doctor
                   Re
I'll examine every inch of you
              Sim
If you want a driver

Climb inside
                  Sol
Or if you want to take me for a ride
    La                    Sim
You know you can I'm your man

        Re
Ah, the moon's too bright
    Sol
The chain's too tight
    La                Re
The beast won't go to sleep
          Fa#m
I've been running through these promises to you
       Sim
That I made and I could not keep
         Fa#7
Ah but a man never got a woman back
       Sim
Not by begging on his knees
       Sol7
Or I'd crawl to you baby
        Fa#7
And I'd fall at your feet
        Sol7
And I'd howl at your beauty
       Fa#7
Like a dog in heat
        Sol7
And I'd claw at your heart
        Mi7
And I'd tear at your sheet
        La
I'd say please, please
         Sim   Mim   Sim   Mim
I'm your man

Re   Sim   Sol7  Fa#7   Sim

                     Mim
And if you've got to sleep

A moment on the road
       Re
I will steer for you
                   Mim
And if you want to work the street alone
          Re
I'll disappear for you
              Sim
If you want a father for your child
                Sol
Or only want to walk with me a while
           La            Sim
Across the sand I'm your man
