       Sol Re  Do

Sol       Re             Do
 I don't know where I'm going
Sol    Re                  Do
 But I sure know where I've been
Sol      Re/Fa#
 Hanging on the promises
   Do/Mi          Do  Sol/Si Lam
In songs of yesterday
                    Re     Lam
And I've made up my mind,
                        Re
I ain't wasting no more time
           Mim   Lam
Here I go again
Do          Sol  Mim  Lam   Do Re
 Here I go again

Sol       Re                    Do
 Though I keep searching for an answer,
Sol      Re                        Do
 I never seem to find what I'm looking for
Sol          Re/Fa#
 Oh, Lord, I pray
            Do/Mi             Do  Sol/Si Lam
You give me strength to carry on,
                       Re
'Cause I know what it means
   Lam7                            Re      Do  Re
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

Sol         Do        Re    Do Re
Here I go again on my own
      Sol            Do             Re     Do Re
Goin' down the only road I've ever known,
       Sol        Do            Re     Do Re
Like a hobo I was born to walk alone
Lam7                  Re     Lam7
 But I've made up my mind
                        Re    Do Re
I ain't wasting no more time

Sol            Re/Sol          Do/Sol
 Just another heart in need of rescue,
Sol        Re/Sol         Do/Sol
 Waiting on love's sweet charity
Sol         Re/Fa#
 I am gonna hold on
        Do/Mi       Do  Sol/Si Lam
For the rest of my days,
                      Re
'Cause I know what it means
   Lam                             Re     Do Re
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

Sol         Do        Re    Do Re
Here I go again on my own
      Sol            Do             Re     Do Re
Goin' down the only road I've ever known,
       Sol        Do            Re     Do Re
Like a hobo I was born to walk alone
Lam7                  Re     Lam7
 But I've made up my mind
                        Re    Do Re
I ain't wasting no more time
    Do     Re   Mim    Lam
But here I go again,
            Mim   Lam
Here I go again,
Re         Mim    Lam
Here I go again,
         Mim    Lam    Do Re
Here I go...
