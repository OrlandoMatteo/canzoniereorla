Mim9
 I should have known better
        Sim7         Doadd9
Than to let you go alone,
Mim9
 It's times like these
        Sim7          Doadd9
I can't make it on my own
Mim9            Sim7      Doadd9
 Wasted days, and sleepless nights
    Domaj7 Sim7    Lam7  Sol      Faadd9
And I    can't wait to see you again
Mim9
 I find I spend my time
Sim7            Doadd9
Waiting on your call,
Mim9
 How can I tell you, baby
   Sim7               Doadd9
My back's against the ball
Mim9
 I need you by my side
   Sim7        Doadd9
To tell me it's alright,
       Domaj7  Sim7   Lam7 Sol     Faadd9
'Cos I don't think I can take anymore

         Doadd9          Re/Do
Is this love that I'm feeling,
             Sim7                Domaj7 Sim7 Lam7
Is this the love, that I've been searching for
Sol       Doadd9       Re/Do
Is this love or am I dreaming,
              Sim7
This must be love,
          Domaj7   Sim7  Lam7 Sol  Faadd9
'Cos it's really got a hold on  me,
          Mim9   Sim7 Doadd9   Mim9  Sim7 Doadd9
A hold on me...

Mim9
 I can't stop the feeling
     Sim7            Doadd9
I've been this way before
Mim7
 But, with you I've found the key
   Sim7     Doadd9
To open any door
Mim9
 I can feel my love for you
        Sim7          Doadd9
Growing stronger day by day,
    Domaj7 Sim7     Lam7     Sol  Faadd9
An' I    can't wait to see you again

So I can hold you in my arms

A hold on me...
