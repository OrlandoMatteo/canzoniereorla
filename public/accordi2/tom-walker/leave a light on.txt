The second someone mentioned you were all alone
        La#
I could feel the trouble coursing through your veins
       Fa              Do
Now I know, it's got a hold
        Rem
Just a phone call left unanswered, had me sparking up
       La#
These cigarettes won't stop me wondering where you are
          Fa        Do
Don't let go, keep a hold
        Rem
If you look into the distance, there's a house upon the hill
  La#
Guiding like a lighthouse it's a place where you'll be
                 Fa
Safe to feel our grace 'cause we've all made mistakes
                    Do
If you've lost your way...

                         Rem  La#
I will leave the light on
                         Fa  Do
I will leave the light on
                         Rem  La#
I will leave the light on

I will leave the light on

Tell me what's been happening, what's been on your mind
 La#
Lately you've been searching for a darker place
   Fa             Do
To hide, that's alright
           Rem
But if you carry on abusing, you'll be robbed from us
 La#
I refuse to lose another friend to drugs
          Fa              Do
Just come home, don't let go

And I know your down and out now, but I need you to be brave

Hiding from the truth ain't gonna make this all okay

I see your pain if you don't feel our grace

Then you've lost your way
