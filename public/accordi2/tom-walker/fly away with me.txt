Rem                    La#   Fa
  I'm strumming on the corner
                                 Rem
About to catch last the train home
                      La#     Fa
I'll have to jump the barriers

So can you spare a penny for my thoughts
          Rem
I've been praised upon the pavements
                 La#
Passers by don't pay much
Fa
Chased away by neighbours
                                 Rem
Seen things you couldn't make up

If these streets could talk
              La#        Fa
They'd tell a story or two

I'll paint a picture for you
Do
 I can tell you what it feels like
La#
 To lose your home on a cold night
Do
Can you see the blood in my red eyes
La#                      Do          Rem
Have another toke, we'll forget life

La#maj7             Do
 So come and fly away with me
     Rem
To a place where we could be
Solm9   Fa
anyone we wanna be
La#maj7          Do
 We can bottle up our fear
       Rem
Brew a taste so sweet
      Solm9    Fa
Knock us off our feet
       La#maj7
And we'll
         Do                   Rem
Burn our troubles Inhale them all
           Solm9    Fa         La#maj7
Paint the future on a fractured wall
                 Do
So come and fly away with me
     Rem                     Solm9   Fa
To a place where we could be anyone we wanna be

Rem                          La#    Fa
 Still in the station when I wake up
                           Rem
I missed the last train home
                   La#    Fa
Jump back over the barriers

No one's got a penny for my flaws
     Rem
I'm asleep upon the pavement
                La#       Fa
Passersby don't say much, tutted at by strangers
                                    Rem
Dreamt things you'd never dream of
                                          La#        Fa
If these streets could talk they'd tell a story or two

I'll paint a picture for you
Do6
 I can tell you what it feels like
   La#maj7
To lose something you love on a cold night
       Do6
As the cars roll by under the street lights
        La#maj7                 Do6      Rem
There's only one way I can forget life

La#maj7             Do
 So come and fly away with me

                      La7/Re
These streets I'm walking
                           Rem7
They've started talking to me
           La7/Re   Rem
Can't you see?
                       La7/Re
There's only one way outta here
                               Rem7
We have to face the things we fear
                                 La7/Re
And we could be anyone we wanna be
                                  La#maj7
Yeah we could be anyone we wanna be
