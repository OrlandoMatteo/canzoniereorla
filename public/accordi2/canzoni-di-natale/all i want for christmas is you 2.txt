[<pre>Sol
Don't want a lot for Christmas
                          Sol7
There is just one thing I need
Do
I don't care about those presents
Dom
Underneath the Christmas tree
Sol                       Si7
I just want you for my own
Mim
More than you could ever know
Sol                   Mim
Make my wish come true
               Lam                Do
You know that all I want for Christmas
Dom           Sol
Is you...


Sol
I won't ask for much this Christmas
                        Sol7
I won't even wish for snow
Do
No, I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Dom
Underneath the mistletoe
Sol                               Si7
There's no sense in hanging stockings
Mim
There upon the fireplace
Sol                              Mim
Cause Santa he won't make me happy
Lam               Do
With a toy on Christmas Day


Sol                         Si7
I just want you here tonight
Mim
Holding on to me so tight
Sol                 Mim
Girl, what can I do?
               Lam                 Do
You know that all I want for Christmas
Dom           Sol
Is you...


Si7
And all the lights are shining
Mim
So brightly everywhere
Si7
And the sound of children's
Mim
Laughter fills the air
Do
And everyone is singing
Dom
I can hear those sleigh bells ringing
Do
Santa won't you bring me the one I really love
Dom
Won't you please bring my baby to me...


Sol
I don't want a lot for Christmas
                       Sol7
This is all I'm asking for
Do
No, I just wanna see my baby
Dom
Standing right outside my door
Sol                         Si7
Oh I just want you for my own
Mim
More that you could ever know
Sol                     Mim
Make my wish come true
              Lam                  Do
You know that all I want for Christmas
Dom           Sol
Is you...</pre>]
