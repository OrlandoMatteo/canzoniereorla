Silent night! Holy night! All is calm all is bright 
Do                Sol                Do              Sol
Round yon virgin mother and child Holy infant so tender and mild

Sleep in heavenly peace! Sleep in heavenly peace!

Do                   Sol           Do                   Sol
Glories stream from heaven afar Heavenly hosts sing Hallelujah
Re          Re7           Sol Mim  Sol          Re          Sol
Christ the Saviour is born! Christ the Saviour is born!

Do                  Sol             Do                   Sol
Radiant beams from thy holy face With the dawn of redeeming grace
Re     Re7            Sol Mim   Sol     Re           Sol
Jesus lord at thy birth! Jesus lord at thy birth!</pre>]
