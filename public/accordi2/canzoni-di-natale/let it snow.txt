        Re         La7     Re
Oh, the weather outside is frightful
        Mim7    Mi7/Sol# La
But the fire is so   delightful
    Mim7           Si7      Mi9
And since we've no place to go
       La7                       Re
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
                     La7      Re
Man, it doesn't show signs of stopping
         Mim7       Mi7/Sol#      La
And I've brought me some corn for popping
    Mim7       Si7             Mi9
The lights are turned way down low
       La7                       Re
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

     La
When we finally kiss goodnight
         Sim7       Mi7        La
How I'll hate going out in the storm
                                Fa#7
But if you really hold me tight
Si9         Mi7          La   La7
All the way home I'll be warm

        Re      La7    Re
And the fire is slowly dying
        Mim7        Mi7/Sol#  La
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
       Mim7    Si7         Mi9
But as long as you love me so
       La7                    Re
Let it snow, let it snow, and snow
