[<pre>Sol                                             Do
Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh,
 Lam                 Re7                   Sol
O'er the fields we go, laughing all the way.
                                         Do
Bells on bob-tails ring, making spirits bright,
    Lam          Re             Re7              Sol      Re7
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight. Oh!


Sol                                   Do   Sol
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
 Do             Sol
Oh what fun it is to ride
 La7                  Re7
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!
Sol
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
 Do             Sol
Oh what fun it is to ride
 Re7                  Sol
In a one-horse open sleigh


  Sol                                    Do
A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride
    Lam              Re7                      Sol
And soon Miss Fanny Bright was seated by my side
                                                    Do
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot
    Lam        Re               Re7            Sol    Re7
We ran into a drifted bank and there we got upsot. Oh!


Sol                                   Do   Sol
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
 Do             Sol
Oh what fun it is to ride
 La7                  Re7
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!
Sol                                   Do   Sol
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
 Do             Sol
Oh what fun it is to ride
 Re7                  Sol
In a one-horse open sleigh


  Sol                                Do
A day or two ago, the story I must tell
   Lam              Re7                    Sol
I went out on the snow and on my back I fell
                                          Do
A gent was riding by in a one-horse open sleigh
    Lam          Re            Re7              Sol      Re7
He laughed at me as I there lay but quickly drove away.  Oh!


Sol                                   Do   Sol
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
 Do             Sol
Oh what fun it is to ride
 La7                  Re7
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!
Sol                                   Do   Sol
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
 Do             Sol
Oh what fun it is to ride
 Re7                  Sol
In a one-horse open sleigh


Sol                                           Do
Now the ground is white, go it while you're young
 Lam              Re7                           Sol
Take the girls along and sing this sleighing song
                                            Do
Just bet a bobtailed bay, two forty as his speed
 Lam          Re              Re7                    Sol     Re7
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack! you'll take the lead. Oh!


Sol                                   Do   Sol
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
 Do             Sol
Oh what fun it is to ride
 La7                  Re7
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!
Sol                                   Do   Sol
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way!
 Do             Sol
Oh what fun it is to ride
 Re7                  Sol
