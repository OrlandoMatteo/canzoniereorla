       Do

               Fa    Sol
It's Christmas time
                Do
There's no need to be afraid
             Fa
At Christmas time
   Sol                 Do
We let in light and we banish shade
           Fa       Sol
And in our world of plenty
       Do                Fa
We can spread a smile of joy
           Rem7            Sol
Throw your arms around the world
             Do
At Christmas time
          Fa     Sol
But say a prayer
             Do
Pray for the other ones
             Fa        Sol
At Christmas time it's hard
                Do
But when you're having fun
          Fa                 Sol
There's a world outside your window
           Do                 Fa
And it's a world of dread and fear
          Rem7       Sol
Where the only water flowing
       Do              Fa
Is the bitter sting of tears
        Rem7                 Sol
And the Christmas bells that ring there
        Do                 Fa
Are the clanging chimes of doom
       Rem7                 Sol
Well tonight thank God it's them
           Do
Instead of you

          Fa               Sol         Do
And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time
    Fa                    Sol              Do
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life (Oooh)
      Fa           Sol
Where nothing ever grows
   Do             Fa
No rain or rivers flow
Rem7              Sol               Do   Fa
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

Lam
Here's to you
        Sol
Raise a glass for everyone
Lam
Here's to them
     Sol
Underneath that burning sun
Fa                Sol               Do   Fa Do
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

Fa Do Rem7 Sol    Do  Fa Do Fa Do Rem7 Sol

Fa       Do        Rem7      Sol
Let them know it's Christmas time again
Do       Fa Do
Feed the world
Fa       Do        Rem7      Sol
Let them know it's Christmas time again
Do       Fa Do
