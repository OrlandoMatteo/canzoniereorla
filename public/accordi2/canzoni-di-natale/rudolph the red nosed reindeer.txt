The most famous reindeer of all?

Sol#
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer (reindeer)
           Rem7b5 Re#7
Had a very shiny   nose (like a light bulb)

And if you ever saw it (saw it)
                      Sol#
You would even say it glows (like a flash light)

All of the other reindeer (reindeer)
                       Rem7b5 Re#7
Used to laugh and call him     names (like Pinochio)

They never let poor Rudolph (Rudolph)
                     Sol#
Play in any reindeer games (like Monopoly)
Do#            Sol#
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Re#7          Sol#
Santa came to say  (Ho Ho Ho)
Re#9
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Fam       La#9     Re#7
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

Sol#
Then all the reindeer loved him  (loved him)
                 Rem7b5  Re#7
And they shouted out with glee (yippee)

"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer (reindeer)
                       Sol#  Sol#9
You'll go down in history!" (like Columbus)
