[<pre>Sol                  Do                     Lam
So at my show on Monday, I was thinking someday
                 Sim     Re      Sol
You'd be on your way to better things
                    Do                         Lam
It's not about your make up or how you try to shape up
          Sim       Re    Sol    
To these tiresome paper dreams. 
    Do Lam      Sim Re
Paper dreams honey


Sol                    Do                           Lam
So now you pour your heart out telling me you're far out
                    Sim   Re             Sol
But not about to lie down for your cause
              Do
But you don't pull my strings
          Lam          Sim           Re      Sol
Cos I'm a better man moving on to better things


Sol   Re           Lam
But oooh I love her because
   Sim        Re       Mim
She moves in her own way
    Do             Lam
But oooh she came to my show
        Sim    Re       Sol
Just to hear about my day


Sol                  Do                       Lam
And at the show on Tuesday, she was in her mindset
                 Sim     Re      Sol
Tempered furs and spangled boots
                  Do                Lam
Looks are deceiving make me believe it
          Sim       Re      Sol     Do Lam      Sim Re
And these tiresome paper dreams. Paper dreams honey


Sol                Do                   Lam
So won't you go far tell me you're a keeper
             Sim   Re             Sol
Not about to lie down for your cause
              Do
And you don't pull my strings
          Lam          Sim           Re      Sol
Cos I'm a better man moving on to better things


Sol   Re           Lam
But oooh I love her because
   Sim        Re       Mim
She moves in her own way
    Do             Lam
But oooh she came to my show
        Sim    Re       Sol
Just to hear about my day


Mim     Sim                 Re    Do
Yes, I wish that we never made it
Sol
Through all the summers
Mim          Sim                      Do
and kept them up instead of kicking us
     Sol
back down to the suburbs
Mim     Sim                 Re    Do
Yes, I wish that we never made it
Sol

Mim          Sim                      Do
and kept them up instead of kicking us
     Sol
