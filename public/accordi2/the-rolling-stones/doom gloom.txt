I had a dream last night that I was piloting a plane

And all the passengers were drunk and insane

I crash landed in a Louisiana swamp

Shut up a horde of zombies but I come out on top

I had a dream last night, That I was piloting a plane...
Do
What's it about?
  Sol                       Rem
I guess it just reflects my mood
Do
Sitting in the dirt
Sol
Feeling kind of hurt

Rem   Do      Sol      Rem
All I hear is doom and gloom
       Do      Sol    Rem
All is darkness in my room
             Do         Sol    Rem
Through the light your face I see
Do
Baby take a chance
Sol                       Rem
Baby won't you dance with me

Rem
Lost all the treasure in an overseas war

It just goes to show you don't get what you paid for

Care about the rich and worrying about the poor

Put the feet up on the couch and lock all the doors
Do                 Sol             Rem
Hear a funky noise tightening of the screens
Do
Feeling kind of hurt
Sol
Sitting in the dirt

Rem   Do      Sol       Rem
All I hear is doom and gloom
                Do       Sol       Rem
But when those drums go boom boom boom
             Do         Sol   Rem
Through the night your face I see
Do
Baby take a chance
Sol                  Rem
Baby won't you dance with me
Do
  Yeah!
Sol                 Rem
Baby won't you dance with me

Ah Yeah!

         Rem
Fracking deep for oil there's nothing in the sump

There's kids all picking at the garbage dump

I am running out of water so I better prime the pump

I am trying to stay sober but I end up drunk
Do                   Sol                       Rem
We'll be eating dirt living on the side of the road
Do                            Sol                        Rem
There's some food for thought kind of makes your head explode
Do                   Sol
Felling kind of hurt
Rem   Do      Sol       Rem
All I hear is doom and gloom
        Do     Sol     Rem
All is darkness in my room
            Do         Sol     Rem
Through the night your face I see
              Do
Baby come on
         Sol               Rem   Do
Baby won't you dance with me
      Sol   Rem
Yeah!
Do
Felling kind of hurt
Sol                       Rem    Do  Sol  Rem
Baby won't you dance with me
Do
Sitting in the dirt
Sol                       Rem
Baby won't you dance with me
