She confessed her love to me

Then she vanished on the breeze

Trying to hold on to that was just impossible

She was more than beautiful

Closer to etherial

With a kind of down to earth flavor

 Close my eyes
     Fa/La              Sol6/La
It's three in the afternoon
      Lam7  Sol6/La
Then I realize
     Fa/La                 Mim
That she's really gone for good

Anybody seen my    baby
        Do   Re/Do Mim
Anybody seen her around
                  Do      Re/Do
Love has gone and made me blind
     Mim9                  Mim
I've looked but I just can't find
               Do   Re     Mim
She has gotten lost in the crowd

Lam
I was flippin' magazines

In that place on Mercer Street
                               Fa Lam
When I thought I spotted her

Getting on a motor bike

Looking rather lady like
                                Fa Lam
Didn't she just give me a wave?
Lam7     Sol6/La
 Salty tears
     Fa/La              Lam7
It's three in the afternoon
              Sol6/La
Has she disappeared
   Fa/La               Mim
Is she really gone for good
