Childhood living is easy to do

The things that you wanted     I bought them for you
Sim         Sol         Sim       Sol
Graceless lady you know who I am
Lam7                Do    Re Sol                Re

Now you've decided,  to show me the same

No sweeping exit or offstage lines
Lam7                 Do      Re Sol               Re
Could make me feel bitter    or treat you unkind

Wild Horses,  couldn't drag me away

I have my freedom     but I don't have much time
Sim            Sol        Sim           Sol
Faith has been broken, tears must be cried

Let's do some living,   after we die

Wild Horses, couldn't drag me away
Lam7   Do         Re Sol      Fa              Do
Wild wild Horses, we'll ride them some day
