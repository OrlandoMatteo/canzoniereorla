        Si   Mi La  Si   Mi La

        Si   Mi La  Si

      Si
I was born in a crossfire hurricane

And I howled at my ma in the driving rain
         Re  La    Mi                  Si
But it's all right now, in fact it's a gas
         Re  La
But it's all right
    Mi                         Si
I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas, gas

      Si
I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag

I was schooled with a strap right across my back
         Re  La    Mi                  Si
But it's all right now, in fact it's a gas
         Re  La
But it's all right
    Mi                         Si
I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas, gas

Si   Mi La Si   Mi La Si   Mi La Si   Mi La Si

      Si
I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead

I fell down, to my feet and I saw they bled

Yeah, and I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread, yeah yeah

Yeah, I was crowned with a spike right through my head
         Re  La    Mi                  Si
But it's all right now, in fact it's a gas
         Re  La
But it's all right
    Mi                         Si
I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas, gas

Si                  Mi     La
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Si                  Mi     La
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Si                  Mi     La
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Si                  Mi     La
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Si                  Mi     La
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas
Si                  Mi     La
Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas...
