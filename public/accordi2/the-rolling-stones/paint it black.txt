Mim                       Si
  I see a red door and I want it painted black.
Mim                     Si
  No colours anymore I want them to turn black.
Mim  Re       Sol          Re          Mim
  I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes.
Mim  Re       Sol       Re       La               Si
  I have to turn my head until my darkness goes.


Mim                         Si
  I see a line of cars and they're all painted black.
Mim                              Si
  With flowers and my love both never to come back.
Mim  Re          Sol          Re         Mim
  I see people turn their heads and quickly look away.
Mim       Re       Sol    Re       La             Si
  Like a newborn baby it just happens every day.


Mim                         Si
  I look inside myself and see my heart is black.
Mim                          Si
  I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Mim      Re         Sol     Re       Mim
  Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts.
Mim         Re    Sol      Re       La                   Si
  It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black.


Mim                             Si
  No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue.
Mim                              Si
  I could not forsee this thing happening to you.
Mim   Re      Sol      Re      Mim
  If I look hard enough into the setting sun
Mim   Re         Sol          Re     La              Si
  My love will laugh with me before the morning comes.


Mim                       Si
  I see a red door and I want it painted black.
Mim                     Si
  No colours anymore I want them to turn black.
Mim  Re       Sol          Re          Mim
  I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes.
Mim  Re       Sol       Re       La               Si
  I have to turn my head until my darkness goes.
