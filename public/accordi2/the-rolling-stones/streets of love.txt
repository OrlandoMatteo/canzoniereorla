         Do
  You're awful bright
         Do/Si
  You're awful smart
    Mim
  I must admit
      Faadd9
  you broke my heart
      Do
  The awful truth
     Do/Si
  is really sad
    Mim
  I must admit
        Faadd9
  I was awful bad
        Do
  While lovers laughed
            Sol
        and music plays
    Lam7
  I stumbled by
        Sol
  and I hide my pain
      Faadd9
  The lamps are lit
      Sol
  the moon is gone
    Faadd9
  I think I've crossed
      Sol
  the Rubicon

  Do
  Ay Ay Ay Ay
  Sol
  Ay Ay Ay Ay
             Lam
        Walked the streets of love
              Fa
  And they're full of tears
  Do
  Ay Ay Ay Ay
  Sol/Si
  Ay Ay Ay Ay
             Lam
  Walked the streets of love
              Fa
  And they're full of tears

              Do
        While music pumps
             Do/Si
        from passing cars
          Lam7
        A couple watched
           Faadd9
        me from above
          Do
        A band just played
            Do/Si
        the wedding march
                Mim
        and the cornerstore
              Faadd9
        mends broken hearts
            Do
        The woman ends
           Sol
        if for her debts
             Lam
        It's free of charge
             Sol
        just one more chance

  Do
  Ay Ay Ay Ay
  Sol
  Ay Ay Ay Ay
             Lam
        Walked the streets of love
              Fa
  And they're full of tears
  Do
  Ay Ay Ay Ay
  Sol/Si
  Ay Ay Ay Ay
             Lam
  Walked the streets of love
                             Fa
        And they're drenched with tears

       Sol  Fa  Sol  Fa

       Sol  Fa  Lam  Sol

           Do
       You had the moves
           Sol/Si
       you had the cards
         Mim
       I must admit you
            Faadd9
       Were awful smart
           Do
       The awful truth
          Do/Si
       is awful sad
         Mim
       I must admit
             Faadd9
       I was awful bad
