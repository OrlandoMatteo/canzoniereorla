[<pre>Do                                      Mim
I thought I saw a man brought to life
                                   Fa
He was warm, he came around like he was dignified
           Fa
He showed me what it was to cry
Do                                       Mim
Well you couldn't be that man I adored
            Mim             
You don't seem to know 
                       Fa
Don't seem to care what your heart is for 
      Fa
But I don't know him anymore 


       Lam
There's nothing where he used to lie 
Sol 
My conversation has run dry 
Mim
That's what's going on 
Sol                       
Nothing's fine
     Do 
I'm torn


(Do)                  Sol                  Lam
I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
             Fa                           Do
I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor 
             Sol                      Lam
Illusion never changed, into something real 
              Fa                              Do
I'm wide awake and I can see, the perfect sky is torn
            Sol                  Lam  (Sol)  Fa
You're a little late, I'm already torn 




Do                                    Mim
So I guess the fortune teller's right
                                              Fa
I should have seen just what was there and not some holy light
       Fa
But you crawl beneath my veins and now
        

Lam
I don't care, I have no luck
Sol
I don't miss it all that much 
Mim
There's just so many things
Sol
That I can't touch
    Do
I'm torn




(Do)                  Sol                  Lam
I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
             Fa                           Do
I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor 
             Sol                      Lam
Illusion never changed, into something real 
              Fa                              Do
I'm wide awake and I can see, the perfect sky is torn
            Sol                  Lam  (Sol)  Fa
You're a little late, I'm already torn        




Lam  (Sol)  Fa        Lam            Do         Sol
Torn...             Ooooh...  Hoo ooooh...  Ooooh


Lam
There's nothing where he used to lie
Sol
My inspiration has run dry
Mim
That's what's going on
Sol
Nothing's right
Do
I'm torn



(Do)                    Sol                Lam
I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel

Illusion never changed, into something real

I'm wide awake and I can see, the perfect sky is torn
               Sol                Lam    
I'm all out of faith, this is how I feel
             Fa                              Do
I'm cold and I am shamed, bound and broken on the floor
            Sol                  Lam  (Sol)  Fa
You're a little late, I'm already torn 



Lam   Sol
Torn...            
Lam
Ooh...</pre>]
