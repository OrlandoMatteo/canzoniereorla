    Mi              Mimaj7
And now, the end is near
         Mi7            Do#7sus4   Do#7
And so I face the final curtain
    Fa#m            Fa#m7
You cunt, I'm not a queer
              Si7               Mi
I'll state my case of which I'm certain
                         Mi7
I've lived a life that's full
    La             Lam
And each and every highway
    Mi                   Si
And that, much more than this
         La6  Mi
I did it my   way

  Mi
Regrets I've had a few
                           Do#
But then again, too few to mention
  Fa#m
I did what I had to do
         Si               Mi
I saw it through without exemption

I've planned each charted course
             La             Lam
Each careful step along the highway
    Mi                   Si
And more, much more than this
            Mi
I did it my way

There were times,

I'm sure you knew
               La
When there was fuck, fuck

Fuck all else to do
               Fa#m
But through it all,
               Si
When there was doubt
          Sol#m           Do#m
I shot it up or kicked it out
            Fa#m        Si
I faced 'em all and the world
           Mi
And did it my way

     Mi
I've loved and been a snide
                              Do#
I've had my fill, my share of losing
    Fa#m
And now the tears subside
          Si      Mi
I find it all so amusing

To think, I killed a cat
           La              Lam
And might I say not in the die way
   Mi         Si
Oh no, oh no, not me
         Mi
I did it my way

For what is a brat,

What has he got
              La
When he wears hats and he cannot
        Fa#m            Si
Say the things he truly feels
             Sol#m
But only the words
           Do#m
Of one who kneels
           Fa#m
The record shows,
               Si
I've stuffed a bloke
           Mi
And did it my way
