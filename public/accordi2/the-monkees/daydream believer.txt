       Sol  Re7  Sol  Re7

            Sol             Lam11
Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings
       Sol/Si          Do
Of the bluebird as she sings
    Sol          Mim              La7   Re7
The six o'clock alarm would never ring
       Sol          Lam7
But it rings and I rise
         Sol/Si          Do
Wipe the sleep out of my eyes
   Sol     Mim     Lam7 Re7    Sol
My shavin' razor's cold and it stings

Sol Re/Fa# Sol Lam7 Sol Re/Fa# Mim

Do        Re     Sim
Cheer up, Sleepy Jean
Do       Re     Mim
Oh, what can it mean
Do  Sol         Do
To a daydream believer
     Sol Mim     La7    Re7
And a homecoming queen

Sol                 Lam7
You once thought of me
     Sol/Si              Do
As a white knight on his steed
Sol              Mim         La7  Re7
Now you know how happy I can be
            Sol                  Lam7
Oh, and our good times start and end
        Sol/Si        Do
Without dollar one to spend
    Sol       Mim   Lam7   Re7   Sol
But how much, baby, do we really need

Sol Re/Fa# Sol Lam7 Sol Re/Fa# Mim

Do        Re     Sim
Cheer up, Sleepy Jean
Do       Re     Mim
Oh, what can it mean
Do  Sol         Do
To a daydream believer
     Sol Mim     La7    Re7
And a homecoming queen
Do        Re     Sim
Cheer up, Sleepy Jean
Do       Re     Mim
Oh, what can it mean
Do  Sol         Do
To a daydream believer
     Sol Mim     La7    Re7
And a homecoming queen

Sol  Re7  Sol  Re7

Do        Re     Sim
Cheer up, Sleepy Jean
Do       Re     Mim
Oh, what can it mean
Do  Sol         Do
To a daydream believer
     Sol Mim     La7    Re7
And a homecoming queen...
