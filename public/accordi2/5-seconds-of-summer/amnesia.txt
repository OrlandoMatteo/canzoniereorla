[<pre>  Do                                  Fa
I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
  Do                                      Fa
I thought about our last kiss how it felt the way you tasted
    Lam                                      Fa
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
          Do                             Fa
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he's right beside you
        Do                                     Fa
When he says those words that hurt you do you read the ones I wrote you?

    Lam                             Fa
Sometimes I start to wonder was it just a lie?
   Lam                             Fa
If what we had was real how could you be fine?

Cause I'm not fine at all


    Do                                   Sol
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
    Lam                                  Fa
I remember the makeup running down your face
        Do                                Sol
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
     Lam                        Fa
Like every single wish we ever made

  Do                               Sol
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
      Lam                          Fa
And forget about the stupid little things
         Do                               Sol
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
        Lam                   Fa
And the memories I never can escape

Cause I'm not fine at all


    Do                                        Fa
The pictures that you sent me they're still living in my phone
      Do                            Fa
I'll admit I like to see them I'll admit I feel alone
Lam                                Fa
All my friends keep asking why I'm not around
   Do                                Fa
It hurts to know you're happy and it hurts that you've moved on
     Do                                     Fa
It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long

     Lam                            Fa
It's like we never happened was it just a lie?
   Lam                             Fa
If what we had was real how could you be fine?

Cause I'm not fine at all


  Do                                     Sol
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
  Lam                                    Fa
I remember the makeup running down your face
        Do                                 Sol
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
     Lam                        Fa
Like every single wish we ever made

I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
      Lam                          Fa
And forget about the stupid little things
         Do                               Sol
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
        Lam                   Fa
And the memories I never can escape


   Sol                              Lam
If today I woke up with you right beside me
     Fa                                 Do
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
    Sol                           Lam
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
         Fa
And you'd never slip away
         Fa
And you'd never hear me say


    Do                                   Sol
I remember the day you told me you were leaving

I remember the makeup running down your face
        Do                                 Sol
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
     Lam                        Fa
Like every single wish we ever made
  Do                              Sol
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia

And the memories I never can escape


    Sol                   Do
'Cause I'm not fine at all
   Sol                     Do
No I'm really not fine at all
   Lam                    Do     Sol
Tell me this is just a dream
      Sol                       Do
'Cause I'm really not fine at all</pre>]
