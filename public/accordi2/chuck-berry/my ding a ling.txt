My grandmother bought me a cute little toy
             Sol#
Silver bells hangin' on a string
    La#
She told me it was my ding a ling

Re#              Sol#
My ding a ling, my ding a ling
La#                    Re#

And then mother took me to Grammar School
    La#                  Re#
But I stopped all in the vestibule
               Sol#
Every time that bell would ring
La#                        Re#
Catched me playin' with my ding a ling

 Once I was climbing the garden wall
  La#               Re#
I slipped and had a terrible fall
                 Sol#
I fell so hard I heard bells ring
    La#           Re#
But held on to my ding a ling

Once I was swimming cross Turtle creek
La#                Re#
Many snappers all around my feet
                       Sol#

La#                        Re#
With both hands holdin' my ding a ling
