Way down in Louisiana down to New Orleans
    La#
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
      Re#
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
      La#
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
    Fa
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
             La#
But he could play a guitar just like he's ringin' a bell

    La#
Go, Go!
               La#
Go, Johnny Go, Go!
                  Re#

           La#
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
    La#
And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track
    Re#
The engineers would see him sittin' in the shade
La#
Strummin' to the rhythm that the driver made
     Fa
When people passed him by they would stop and say
   La#
Oh my that little country boy sure can play

    La#
Go, Go!
               La#
Go, Johnny Go, Go!

Well his mama told him one day you will be a man
La#
You will be the leader of a big old band
Re#
Many people coming from miles around

To hear you play your music when the sun go down

Maybe someday your name will be in lights
