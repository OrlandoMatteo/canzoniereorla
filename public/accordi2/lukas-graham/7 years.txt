It was a big big world,
                                Do
but we thought we were bigger.

Pushing each other to the limits,

we were learning quicker.
          Re      Sol

and drinking burning liquor
                                       Re
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

I always have that dream

like my Daddy before me

I started writing stories
                     Re  Sol
Something about that glory,
                              Do
just always seemed to bore me,

I only see my goals,
                              Do
I don't believe in failure.
Cause I know the smallest voices,

they can make it major,
              Re   Sol                           Do
I got my boys with me at least those in favor
and if we don´t meet before I leave,
          Re
I hope to see you later.
