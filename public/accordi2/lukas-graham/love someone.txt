[<pre>Do                      Mim
There are days
                 Lam
I wake up and I pinch myself
                       Fa
You're with me, not someone else
Do                                Mim
And I am scared, yeah, I'm still scared
          Lam    Fa
That it's all a dream


Fa                     Sol       Lam         Fa
  'Cause you still look perfect as days go by
         Sol           Lam          Fa
Even the worst ones, you make me smile
          Sol       Lam        Mim   Fa   Soladd11
I'd stop the world if it gave us time


                Fa           Sol
'Cause when you love someone
    Do             Lam
You open up your heart
         Fa           Sol
When you love someone
          Lam
You make room
       Fa           Sol
If you love someone
            Do             Lam
And you're not afraid to lose them
                      Fa         Sol         Lam
You'll probably never love someone like I do
                     Fa         Sol        Lam   Fa
You'll probably never love someone like I do   uhh  uhh


Do                Mim
When you say
                    Lam
You love the way I make you feel
          Fa
Everything becomes so real
Do                              Mim
Don't be scared, no, don't be scared

'Cause you're all I need


Fa                    Sol       Lam         Fa

Rem            Sol
All my life
                  Do
I thought it'd be hard to find
                     Lam
The one 'til I found you
               Rem      Sol
And I find it bittersweet
            Lam                    Rem
'Cause you gave me something to lose


              Fa              Sol
And when you love someone
     Do            Lam
You open up your heart
