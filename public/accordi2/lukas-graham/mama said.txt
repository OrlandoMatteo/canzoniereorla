When mama said that it was okay
                      Rem      Solm
Mama said that it was quite alright
                         Rem           Solm
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
             Fa
And it was okay

Mama told us we were good kids
                        Rem            Solm
And daddy told us never listen to the ones
               Rem                 Solm
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
                     Fa
'Cause we were good kids

                        Solm
Remember asking both my mom and dad
             Fa/La         La#
Why we never travelled to exotic lands
                    Solm
We only ever really visit friends
           Fa/La         La#
Nothing to tell when the summer ends
                     Solm
We never really went buying clothes
Re#                                La#
Folks were passing on the stuff in plenty loads
                 Solm
New shoes once a year and then
            Fa/La            La#
Out to play ball so we could ruin them

Don't get me wrong I didn't have it bad
             Fa/La          La#
I got enough loving from my mom and dad
                              Solm
But I don't think they really understood
                    Fa/La           La#
When I said that I wanted a deal in Hollywood
                           Solm
I told them I'd be singing on TV
    Re#                          La#
The other kids were calling me a wannabe
                            Solm
The older kids they started bugging me
                    Fa/La             La#
But now they're all standing right in front of me

 I know which place I'm from, I know my home
Solm         Do7/Mi
 When I'm in doubt and struggling
Re#             La#
 That's where I go
       Solm               Do7/Mi
An old friend can give advice
          Re#6                     La#
Where new friends only know a half story
             Solm              Do7/Mi
That's why I always keep them tight
             Re#
And why I'm okay,
             Re7
I said, I'm OK

You know what my mama said

You know what she told me
