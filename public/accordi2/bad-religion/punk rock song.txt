         Do#m        Mi               Si              Fa#
Have you been to the desert, have you walked with the dead?
          Do#m             Mi             Si               Sol#
There's a hundred thousand children being killed for their bread
        La                              Mi
And the figures don't lie they speak of human disease
       Si                     Mi            Si
But we do what we want and we think what we please
         Do#m          Mi               Si             Fa#
Have you lived the experience, Have you witnessed the plague?
Do#m          Mi               Si       Sol#
People making babies sometimes just to escape
        La                         Mi
In this land of competition the compassion is gone
       Si                      Mi           Si
Yet we ignore the needy and we keep pushing on
Mi           Si
Keep pushing on

Do#m    La     Mi        Si
This is just a punk rock song
Do#m            La             Mi              Sol#
Written for the people who can see something's wrong
     La                  Mi
Like ants in a colony we do our share
            Sol#
But there's so many other fuckin' insects out there
Do#m    La     Mi   Sol# Do#m  Mi  Si  Sol#
This is just a punk rock song

   Do#m Mi Si Sol#

         Do#m            Mi             Si          Fa#
Have you visited the quagmire, have you swam in the shit?
    Do#m     Mi               Si       Sol#
The party conventions and the real politik
    La                             Mi
The faces always different, the rhetoric the same
       Si                        Mi      Si
But we swallow it all and we see nothing changed
Mi          Si
Nothing has changed

Do#m     La    Mi        Si
This is just a punk rock song
Do#m            La             Mi              Sol#

10 million dollars on a losing campaign
Do#m       Mi           Si           Fa#
20 million starving and writhing in pain
Do#m       Mi       Si          Fa#
Big strong people unwilling to give
Do#m      Mi        Si    Sol#
Small in vision and perspective
La                         Mi
One in five kids below the poverty line
Si                     Mi     Si
One population runnin' out of time
Mi            Si
Runnin' outta time
