          Lam                         Fa
There's a place where everyone can be happy
              Do                                   Sol
It's the most beautiful place in the whole fucking world
     Lam
It's made of candy canes and planes
    Fa
And bright red choo-choo trains
        Do                               Re5             Mi
And the meanest little boys and the most innocent little girls
        Lam                      Fa
And you know I wish that I could go there
       Do                   Sol
It's a road that I have not found
    Lam                    Fa
And I wish you the best of luck, dear
Do                         Re5        Mi
Drop a card or a letter to my side of town
                Fa                      Mi
Because there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend
    Fa                     Mi        Fa      Sol
But baby I'm amazed at the hate that you can send and
Lam Fa Sol  Lam
You...
                  Fa     Do Mi
painted my entire world
    Lam Fa Sol
But I
                             Lam                 Fa   Mi
Don't have the turpentine to clean what you have soiled
                        Lam
And I won't forget it

          Lam                         Fa
There's a place where everyone can be right
     Do                                   Sol
Even though you remain determined to be opposed
  Lam                         Fa
Admittance requires no qualifications
           Do                          Re5       Mi
It's where everyone has been and where everybody goes
   Lam                      Fa
So please try not to be impatient
       Do                   Sol
For we all hate standing in line
    Lam
And when the farm is good and bought
          Fa
You'll be there without a thought
     Do                       Re5          Mi
And eternity, my friend, is a long fucking time
                Fa                      Mi
Because there's no time for fussing and fighting my friend
    Fa                     Mi        Fa      Sol
But baby I'm amazed at the hate that you can send and
Lam Fa Sol Lam
You...
                  Fa     Do  Mi
painted my entire world
    Lam  Fa  Sol
But I
                             Lam                 Fa  Mi
Don't have the turpentine to clean what you have soiled
                        Lam Fa Sol Do
And I won't forget it

Lam Fa Sol Do   Lam Fa Sol Mi   Mi Fa Sol Fa  La7add6
