Let it go
       Re
Let it go
      Mim               Do
Can’t hold you back anymore
       Sol
Let it go
       Re
Let it go
        Mim                Do
Turn my back and slam the door


    Mim                      Do
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
      Re               Lam
Not a footprint to be seen
  Mim             Do            Re                  Lam
A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I'm the Queen
Mim           Do                Re                Lam
 The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside
Mim                Re                 La
 Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried

Re                                  Do
 Don't let them in, don't let them see

Be the good girl

You always had to be
Re
 Conceal, don't feel
               Do
Don't let them know
      Do
Well, now they know

Let it go
       Re
Let it go
        Mim                Do
Turn my back and slam the door
    Sol      Re          Mim        Do
And here I stand, and here I'll stay
       Sol
Let it go
       Re
Let it go
    Do
The cold never bothered me anyway


     Mim             Do
It's funny how some distance
      Re               Lam
Makes everything seem small
        Mim                 Do
And the fears that once controlled me
      Re             La
Can't get to me at all
Mim             Do
Up here in the cold thin air
  Re             Lam
I finally can breathe
  Mim            Do                   Re               La
I know I left a life behind but I'm too relieved to grieve

       Re
Let it go
        Mim                Do
Turn my back and slam the door

And here I stand
    Mim        Do
And here I'll stay
       Sol
Let it go
       Re
Let it go
    Do
The cold never bothered me anyway


Sol        Re      Mim      Do
 Standing frozen in the life I've chosen
Sol         Re        Mim           Do
 You won't find me, the past is so behind me
Sol      Re       Mim      Do
 Buried in the snow


       Sol
Let it go
       Re
Let it go

And here I stand

And here I’ll stay

Let it go
