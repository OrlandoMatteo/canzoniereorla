[<pre>Sol Do Mim Re


           Sol             Do
Skies are crying, I am watching
           Mim             Re
Catching teardrops in my hands
        Sol               Do             Mim             Re
Only silence, as its ending, like we never had a chance
         Mim               Do                Sol             Re
Do you have to make me feel like there’s nothing left of me?

              Sol            Do
You can take everything I have
              Mim            Re
You can break everything I am
                   Sol   Do
Like I’m made of glass
                 Mim  Re
Like I’m made of paper
           Sol              Do
Go on and try to tear me down
           Mim                Re
I will be rising from the ground
            Sol    Do           Mim    Re
Like a skyscraper, like a skyscraper


         Sol
As the smoke clears
    Do           Mim             Re
I awaken and untangle you from me
          Sol             Do        Mim               Re
Would it make you feel better to watch me while I bleed
         Mim                Do            Sol              Re
All my windows still are broken but I’m standing on my feet

             Sol              Do
You can take everything I have
               Mim           Re
You can break everything I am
                   Sol   Do
Like I’m made of glass
                   Mim Re
Like I’m made of paper
           Sol              Do
Go on and try to tear me down
           Mim                Re
I will be rising from the ground
            Sol    Do           Mim    Re
Like a skyscraper, like a skyscraper


Lam            Do                        Mim
  Go run run run I’m gonna stay right here
              Sol
Watch you disappear yeah
Lam            Do                       Mim
  Go run run run yeah it’s a long way down
                                Re
But I’m closer to the clouds up here


             Sol              Do
You can take everything I have
               Mim           Re
You can break everything I am
                   Sol   Do
Like I’m made of glass
                   Mim    Re
Like I’m made of paper, Ohh
           Sol               Do
Go on and try to tear me down
           Mim                 Re
I will be rising from the ground
           Sol     Do           Mim    Re
Like a skyscraper, like a skyscraper
           Sol     Do           Mim    Re
Like a skyscraper, like a skyscraper
           Sol
Like a skyscraper</pre>]
