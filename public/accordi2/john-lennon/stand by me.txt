         Sol             Mim
When the night has come and the land is dark
        Do           Re                Sol
And the moon is the only light we'll see
     Sol                        Mim
No I won't be afraid, no I, I won't be afraid
        Do           Re               Sol
Just as long as you stand, stand by me


                      Sol
And darling, darling, stand by me
            Mim
Oh nah, nah, stand by me
Do            Re         Sol
 Stand by me, stand by me


        Sol                   Mim
If the sky that we look upon should tumble and fall
        Do                Re              Sol
and the mountains should crumble to the sea
        Sol                          Mim
I won't cry. I won't cry,  no I, I won't shed a tear
        Do           Re               Sol
Just as long as you stand, stand by me 


                      Sol
And darling, darling, stand by me
            Mim
Oh nah, nah, stand by me
Do            Re            Sol
 Stand by me, stand by me, stand by me-ee yeah
