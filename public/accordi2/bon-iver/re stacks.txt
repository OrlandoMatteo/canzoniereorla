This my excavation and today is Kumran
Re4           Sol          Doadd9
Everything that happens is from now on
                Re4
This is pouring rain
        Doadd9    Lam7
This is paralyzed

Re4              Sol    Doadd9  Re4     Doadd9
I keep throwing it down two-hundred at a time
Re4                Sol        Doadd9
It's hard to find it when you knew it
                  Re4
When your money's gone
           Doadd9        Lam7
And you're drunk as hell

Re4                               Mim7                 Do
On your back with your racks as the stacks as your load
Re4                               Mim7                 Do
In the back and the racks and the stacks are your load
Re4                               Mim7                 Do
In the back with your racks and you're un-stacking your load

I've been twisting to the sun I needed to replace
Re4              Sol              Doadd9
The fountain in the front yard is rusted out
                Re4
All my love was down
      Doadd9        Lam7
In a frozen ground


Sol  Doadd9  Sol  Doadd9  Sol  Doadd9  Sol

There's a black crow sitting across from me;
Re4             Doadd9
his wiry legs are crossed
Re4                Sol             Doadd9
And he's dangling my keys he even fakes a toss
                  Re4
Whatever could it be
                 Doadd9  Lam7
That has brought me to this loss?

Re4                               Mim7                 Do
On your back with your racks as the stacks as your load
Re4                               Mim7                 Do
In the back and the racks and the stacks are your load
Re4                               Mim7                 Do
In the back with your racks and you're un-stacking your load

Re4           Sol          Doadd9      Re4         Doadd9
This is not the sound of a new man or crispy realization
Re4                 Sol                 Doadd9
It's the sound of the unlocking and the lift away
     Re4     Doadd9
Your love will be
            Lam7
Safe with me
