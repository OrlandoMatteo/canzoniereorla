Come on skinny love just last the year

My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
               Re6                       Lam    Famaj7/Do
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer

Lam        Do
I tell my love to wreck it all
Lam              Do
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
        Lam          Do
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
             Re6                   Lam

I told you to be patient
  Do/Si            Fa
I told you to be fine
  Do
I told you to be balanced
  Sol            Fa
I told you to be kind
       Do
In the morning I'll be with you
            Do/Si         Fa
But it will be a different "kind"
        Do
I'll be holding all the tickets
              Do/Si           Fa
And you'll be owning all the fines

Now all your love is wasted?
            Do/Si            Fa
Then who the hell was I?
        Do
Now I'm breaking at the bridges
              Do/Si          Fa
And at the end of all your lines


Do
Who will love you?
Do/Si        Fa
Who will fight?
Do           Do/Si       Fa
Who will fall far behind?
