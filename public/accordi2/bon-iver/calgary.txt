       Sol#m Fa# Si

Mi                             Si
Don't you cherish me to sleep
Mi                      Si
Never keep your eyelids clipped
Sol#m                    Fa#
Hold me for the pops and clicks
      Mi                    Si    Do#m7  Si/Re#
I was only for the father's crib

Sol#m      Fa#   Si
Hair, old, long along
     Mi                             Si
Your neck onto your shoulder blades
Do#m7                    Si/Re#
Always keep that message taped
Sol#m                         Fa#/La#
Cross your breasts you won't erase
      Mi                 Si     Do#m9
I was only for your very space

Sol#m   Fa#  Si
Hip, under nothing
Mi                                   Si
Propped up by your other one, face 'way from the sun
     Do#m7             Si/Re#
Just have to keep a dialogue
Sol#m                       Fa#
Teach our bodies: haunt the cause
      Mi                     Si    Do#m9
I was only trying to spell a loss

Sol#m     Fa# Si
Joy, it's all founded
Mi                             Si
Pincher with the skin inside
    Do#m7                            Si
You pinned me with your black sphere eyes
    Sol#m                      Fa#
You know that all the rope's untied
      Mi                Si    Do#m11
I was only for to die beside

Do#m11    Sol#m

                 Siadd9
So it ºs storming on the lake
                 Fa#           Do#m7  Sol#m
Little waves our bodies break
               Siadd9
There's a fire going out,
                   Fa#                 Do#m9  Sol#m
But there's really nothing to the south
                   Siadd9
Swollen orange and light let through
               Fa#                  Do#m7
Your one piece swimmer stuck to you

Sol#m7  Fa# Si
Sold,   I'm Ever
Mi                        Si
 Open ears and open eyes
Do#m7                     Si
Wake up to your starboard bride
    Sol#m7                   Fa#
Who goes in and then stays inside
       Mi                       Si   Do#m13
Oh the demons come, they can subside
