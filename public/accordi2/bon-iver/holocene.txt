        Do#    La#m7 Sol#     La#m7 Fa#maj7

 Do#                              La#m7       Sol#
"Someway, baby, it's part of me, apart from me"
       La#m7           Fa#maj7
You're laying waste to Halloween
    Do#
You fucked it friend,

It's on its head,
   La#m7           Sol#
It struck the street
  La#m7              Fa#maj7
You're in Milwaukee, off your feet

... and at once I knew I was not magnificent

La#m   Sol#

Fa#maj7                          La#m  Sol#
Strayed above the highway aisle
Fa#maj7 La#m       Do#       Sol#
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
                La#m   Fa#maj7 Fa#/Sol#   Do#
I could see for miles, miles, miles

Do#                             La#m7 Sol#
3rd and Lake it burnt away, the hallway
La#m                    Fa#maj7
Was where we learned to celebrate
Do#                              La#m7     Sol#
Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
     La#m                 Sol#    Fa#maj7
That night you played me 'Lip Parade'
Do#                                 La#m7    Sol#
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
       La#m             Fa#maj7
Saying nothing, that's enough for me

... and at once I knew I was not magnificent

La#m   Sol#

Fa#maj7                             La#m  Sol#
Hulled far from the highway aisle
Fa#maj7 La#m       Do#       Sol#
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
                La#m   Fa#maj7 Fa#/Sol#  Do#
I could see for miles, miles, miles

Do#
Christmas night,
                      La#m7
It clutched the light,
                    Sol#
The hallow bright
 Do#
Above my brother,

I and tangled spines

We smoked the screen to make
           La#m7       Sol#
It what it was to be
       La#m7         Fa#maj7
Now to know it in my memory

... and at once I knew I was not magnificent

La#m   Sol#

Fa#maj7                             La#m  Sol#
Hulled far from the highway aisle
Fa#maj7 La#m       Do#       Sol#
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
                La#m   Fa#maj7 Fa#/Sol#  Do#
I could see for miles, miles, miles
