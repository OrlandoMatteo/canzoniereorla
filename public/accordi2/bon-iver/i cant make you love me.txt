Turn down the lights;
Lam                    Fa
Turn down the bed.
Fa                     Do
Turn down these voices
Lam                 Rem
Inside my head.
Fa                     Lam
Lay down with me;
Lam                 Fa
Tell me no lies.
  Fa                  Do
Just hold me close;
Lam                 Rem
Don't patronize.
Rem                    Sol4  Sol
Don't patronize me.


                       Fa       Do
Cause I can't make you love me
    Rem
If you don't.
                Fa              Do
You can't make your heart feel
  Lam                  Lam  Sol
Something it won't.
Lam              Fa
Here in the dark
     Sol               Lam
In these final hours,
    Lam                     Fa
I will lay down my heart
 Sol                       Lam
And I'll feel the power;
              Rem
But you don't.
               Sol
No, you don't.
             Fa         Do
Cause I can't make you love me

If you don't.

Fa                  Lam
I'll close my eyes,
Lam                  Fa
Then I won't see
Fa                    Do
The love you don't feel
Lam                Sol
When you're holding me.
Fa                  Lam
Morning will come,
Lam                        Fa
And I'll do what's right;
Fa                        Do
Just give me till then
Lam                   Sol
To give up this fight.
Rem                            Sol
And I will give up this fight.

Something it won't.

But you don't.

No, you don't.

If you don't.
