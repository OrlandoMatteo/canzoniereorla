Johanna drove slowly into the city
    La      Sol       Re
The Hudson River all filled with snow
    La        Sol    Re
She spied the ring on His Honor's finger
La  Sol Re    La Sol Re
Oh-oh-oh
  La        Sol      Re
A thousand years in one piece of silver
    La       Sol     Re
She took it from his lily-white hand
La         Sol       Re
Showed no fear she'd seen the thing
       La          Sol     Re
In the Young Men's Wing at Sloan-Kettering

Look outside at the raincoats coming, say oh

His Honor drove southward seeking exotica
La          Sol    Re
Down to the Pueblo huts of New Mexico
La      Sol       Re
Cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas
La  Sol Re   La Sol Re
Oh-oh-oh
La        Sol Re
I saw Johanna down in the subway
    La        Sol        Re
She took an apartment in Washington Heights
La          Sol       Re
Half of the ring lies here with me
        La     Sol          Re
But the other half's at the bottom of the sea
