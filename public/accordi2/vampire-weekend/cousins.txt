You found a sweater on the ocean floor

They're gonna find it if you didn't close the door

You and the smart ones sit outside of their sight

In a house on a street they wouldn't park on at night

Dad was a risk-taker

His was a shoe maker

You, greatest hits 2006 little list-maker

Heard codes in the melodies

You heeded the call

You were born with ten fingers and you're gonna use em all

Fa#7    Si Fa#7    Si

Interesting colors I discovered myself

If your art life is gritty, you'll be toasting my health

If an interest in culture should be lining the walls

When your birthright is interest you could just accrue it all

Mi
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
Fa#7                Si
 It's a line that's always running
Mi
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
Fa#7           Si        Fa#7    Si Fa#7    Si
 I can feel it coming

Fa#7
You could turn your back on the bitter world

You could turn your back on the bitter world

You could turn your back on the bitter world

You could turn your back on the bitter world

Mi
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
Fa#7                Si
 It's a line that's always running
Mi
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
Fa#7           Si
 I can feel it coming
Mi
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
Fa#7                Si
 It's a line that's always running
Mi
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
Fa#7           Si
 I can feel it coming
