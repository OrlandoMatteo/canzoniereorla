[<pre>Do Re Sol Mim    x2


Mim        Do        Re
I used to rule the world 
           Sol                    Mim
Seas would rise when I gave the word 
                     Do       Re
Now in the morning I sleep alone 
          Sol                 Mim
Sweep the streets I used to own


Do Re Sol Mim    x2


Mim       Do         Re
I used to roll the dice 
          Sol                 Mim
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes 
              Do            Re
Listen as the crowd would sing: 
          Sol                 Mim
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
  Mim         Do        Re
One minute I held the key 
         Sol                    Mim
Next the walls were closed on me 
                          Do        Re
And I discovered that my castles stand 
     Sol                    Mim
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand 


  Do              Re
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing 
Sol             Mim
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing 
Do                Re
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield 
   Sol                 Mim
My missionaries in a foreign field 
Do                 Re
For some reason I can't explain 
Sol                     Mim              Do      Re
Once you go there was never, never an honest word
         Sim               Mim 
That was when I ruled the world 


Do Re Sol Mim    x2


Mim                   Do     Re
It was the wicked and wild wind 
              Sol               Mim
Blew down the doors to let me in. 
                          Do        Re
Shattered windows and the sound of drums 
       Sol                    Mim
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Mim       Do      Re
Revolutionaries wait 
        Sol               Mim
For my head on a silver plate 
                   Do      Re
Just a puppet on a lonely string
   Sol                         Mim
Oh who would ever want to be king? 


  Do              Re
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing 
Sol             Mim
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing 
Do                Re
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield 
   Sol                 Mim
My missionaries in a foreign field 
Do                 Re
For some reason I can't explain 
  Sol                     Mim              
I know Saint Peter won't call my name ,
   Do            Re 
never an honest word
              Sim               Mim 
But that was when I ruled the world  


Do  Mim x3

Do  Re  Sol  Mim    x2
(Ohhhhh Ohhh Ohhh)
