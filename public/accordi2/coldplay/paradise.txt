Solm                  Fa
When she was just a girl
Rem               Do
She expected the world
        Solm                 Fa
But it flew away from her reach
        Rem              Do
So she ran away in her sleep
                Solm        La#
And dreamed of para-para-paradise


Fa        Do
Para-para-paradise
Solm         La#
Para-para-paradise
Fa              Do
Every time she closed her eyes


Solm Fa Rem Do
Solm Fa Rem Do


Solm                   Fa
When she was just a girl
Rem                Do
She expected the world
        Solm                 Fa
But it flew away from her reach
         Rem                   Do
And the bullets catch in her teeth
La#              Fa 
Life goes on it gets so heavy
    Fa                Do
The wheel breaks the butterfly
La#            Fa
Every tear a waterfall
        La#               Fa                   Do
In the night the stormy night she close her eyes
        La#               Fa              Do
In the night the stormy night away she flies
              Solm        La#
And dream of para-para-paradise


Fa         Do
Para-para-paradise
Solm          La#
Para-para-paradise

Oh oh ohhh oh ohhh oh ohh ohh

So lying underneath those stormy skies

She said oh I know the sun must set to rise
               Solm       La#
This could be para-para-paradise
