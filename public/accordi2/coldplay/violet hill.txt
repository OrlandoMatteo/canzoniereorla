      Do#m
Was a long and dark December
                    Do#m9
From the rooftops I remember
          La   Si/La  Fa#m   Fa#5 Fa5  Mi5 Re#5
There was snow, white snow
  Do#m
Clearly I remember from the windows
          Do#m9           La     Si/La
They were watching while we froze...
       Fa#m    Fa#5 Fa5  Mi5 Re#5
Down below

         La
When the future's architectured
     Si                    Do#m
By a carnival of idiots on show
                 Si
You'd better lie low
Sol#m  La   Sol#m Mi        Do#m Si  Do#m
If you love me,   won’t you let  me know?

      Do#m
Was a long and dark December
                       Do#m9
When the banks became cathedrals
        La  Si/La     Fa#m    Fa#5 Fa5  Mi5 Re#5
And the fox    became God
Do#m
Priest clutched onto bibles
                          Do#m9
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
        La   Si/La       Fa#m    Fa#5 Fa5  Mi5 Re#5
And the cross  was held aloft

La
Bury me in armour
         Si
When I’m dead and hit the ground
              Do#m          Si
My nerves are poles that unfroze
    Sol#m  La   Sol#m Mi        Do#m Si  Do#m
And if you love me,   won’t you let  me know

 Do#m  Do#m9  La   Laadd9  Fa#m   Fa#5 Fa5  Mi5 Re#5

 Do#m  Do#m9  La   Laadd9  Fa#m   Fa#5 Fa5  Mi5 Re#5

        La
I don’t wanna be a soldier
        Si
who the captain of some sinking ship
      Do#m       Si
would stow far below...
    Sol#m  La   Sol#m Mi        Do#m Si  Do#m  La
And if you love me,   won’t you let  me know

       Si Do#m Fa#m7   Mi Do#m Si6  La
I took my love down to Violet  Hill
      Si  Do#m  Sol#m La
There we sat    in    snow
    Si   Do#m Fa#m    Mi  Do#m  Si6
All that time she was silenced still
    Sol#m  La   Sol#m Mi        Do#m Si  La
So, if you love me,   won’t you let  me  know?
Sol#m  La   Sol#m Mi        Do#m Si Do#m
If you love me,   won’t you let  me know?
