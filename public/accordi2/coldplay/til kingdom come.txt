Do
Steal my heart and hold my tongue

I feel my time my time has come

Let me in unlock the door

I never felt this way before

        Lam         Fa      Do
And the wheels just keep on turning
    Lam       Fa      Do
The drummer begins to drum
        Lam        Fa      Do
I don't know which way I'm going
        Fa         Sol      Do
I don't know which way I've come

        Do
Hold my head inside your hands

I need someone who understands

I need someone someone who hears

For you I've waited all these years

            Fa
For you I'd wait
             Do
'Til Kingdom Come
         Fa
Until my day
          Do
my day is done
               Fa
and say you'll come
    Sol    Lam7
and set me free
                Do/Sol  Fa6/Sol
just say you'll wait
       Sol      Do
you'll wait for me

        Do
In your tears and in your blood

In your fire and in your flood

I hear you laugh I heard you sing

I wouldn't change a single thing
        Lam         Fa      Do
And the wheels just keep on turning
    Lam       Fa      Do
The drummer begins to drum
        Lam        Fa      Do
I don't know which way I'm going
        Fa         Sol      Do
I don't know which way I've come

            Fa
For you I'd wait
             Do
'Til Kingdom Come
         Fa
Until my day
          Do
my day is done
               Fa
and say you'll come
    Sol    Lam7
and set me free
                Do/Sol  Fa6/Sol
just say you'll wait
       Sol      Do
you'll wait for me
                Do/Sol  Fa6/Sol
just say you'll wait
       Sol      Do
you'll wait for me
                Do/Sol  Fa6/Sol
just say you'll wait
       Sol      Do
you'll wait for me
