Ohhhhh, angels sent from up above
              Rem        Sol        Lam
You know you make my world light up
                Rem
When I was down
     Sol       Lam
When I was hurt
             Rem      Lam
You came to lift me up...
            Rem         Sol        Lam
Life is a drink, and love's a drug
           Rem             Sol     Lam
Oh now I think I must be miles up
          Rem    Sol          Lam
When I was a river,  dried up
             Rem       Lam
You came to rain a flood


              Lam             Fa
So drink from me, drink from me
             Rem   Sol
When I was so thirsty
          Lam    Fa
Pour on a symphony
      Rem
Now I just can't get enough
         Lam       Fa
Put your wings on me, wings on me
             Rem    Sol
When I was so heavy
          Lam    Fa
Pour on a symphony
         Rem
When I'm lower, lower, lower, low


 Fa    Sol   Lam
I-Oh-ah-oh-ah
                        Fa
I'm feeling drunk and high
     Sol       Lam
So high, so high
 Fa    Sol   Lam
I-oh-ah-oh-ah
                        Fa
I'm feeling drunk and high
     Sol        Lam
So high, so high

I feel you coursing through my blood
            Rem         Sol        Lam
Life is a drink, your love's about
                Rem        Lam
To make the stars come out

Put your wings on me, on me
