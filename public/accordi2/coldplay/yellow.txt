Sol
Look at the stars
                       Re
Look how they shine for you
                       Do
And everything you do,
Yeah, they were all yellow.
Sol
I came along,
                  Re
I wrote a song for you
                          Do
And all the things you do,
And it was called "Yellow."
Sol                Re
So then I took my turn,
                            Do
Oh what a thing to have done,
                       Sol
And it was all yellow.

[Chorus 1]
Do
Your skin,
Mim       Re
Oh yeah, your skin and bones
Do    Mim        Re
Turn into something beautiful,
Do        Mim        Re
You know, you know I love you so,
Do
You know I love you so.


Sol   Re   Do   Sol 


Sol
I swam across,
                   Re
I jumped across for you,
                      Do
Oh, what a thing to do

'Cause you were all yellow.
Sol                
I drew a line,
                Re
I drew a line for you,
                      Do
Oh, what a thing to do
                      Sol
And it was all yellow.


Do
Your skin,
Mim       Re
Oh yeah, your skin and bones
Do    Mim        Re
Turn into something beautiful,
Do
And you know,
Mim        Re            Do
For you I bleed myself dry,

For you I bleed myself dry.


Sol   Re   Do   Sol  


 Sol                                  Re
It's true, look how they shine for you, 
                        Do
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for,
Sol                       Re
Look how they shine for you,
                        Do
Look how they shine for you,
              Domaj7
Look how they shine.


Sol
Look at the stars,
                       Rem7
Look how they shine for you
                          Domaj7
And all the things that you do.</pre>]
