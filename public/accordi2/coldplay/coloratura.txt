We fell in thorough the clouds
    Re6
And everyone before us
         Re7
Is there welcoming us now
       Sol
Is the end of death and doubt
    Solm
And loneliness is out

Re
Coloratura
    
The place we dreamed about
    Re6
The melodies inside yourself

And love come pouring out

Everyone's allowed

Feathered by the crowd

In the end it's all about
    Solm                     Re 
The love you're sending out

The explorers who've all gathered by balloon saw the world turn
