Si
You cut me down a tree

And brought it back to me

And that's what made me see

Where I was going wrong

You put me on a shelf

And kept me for yourself

I can only blame myself

You can only blame me

    Mi               Si
And I could write a song
  Sol#m          Fa#
A hundred miles long
      Mi               Si
Well, that's where I belong
                   Fa#
And you belong to me
    Mi                Si
And I could write it down
   Sol#m           Fa#
Or spread it all around
    Mi                 Si
Get lost and then get found
                    Fa#     Si
Or swallowed in the sea

    Si          Fa#
You put me on a line
    Mi             Si
And hung me out to dry
    Fa#                 Mi
And darling that's when I
                    Si
Decided to go to see you
                   Fa#
You cut me down to size
    Mi           Si
And opened up my eyes
 Fa#        Mi
Made me realize
                 Si
What I could not see

    Mi               Si
And I could write a book
    Sol#m                 Fa#
The one they'll say that shook
    Mi          Si
The world, and then it took
                     Fa#
It took it back from me
    Mi                Si
And I could write it down
   Sol#m          Fa#
Or spread it all around
    Mi                 Si
Get lost and then get found
                        Fa#
And you'll come back to me
    Mi               Si
Not swallowed in the sea

Do#m  Mi  Si  Fa#   Do#m  Mi  Si  Fa#

Do#m  Mi  Si  Fa#   Do#m  Mi  Si  Fa#

    Mi               Si
And I could write a song
  Sol#m          Fa#
A hundred miles long
      Mi               Si
Well, that's where I belong
                   Fa#
And you belong to me
    Mi                     Si
The streets you're walking on
  Sol#m            Fa#
A thousand houses long
      Mi               Si
Well, that's where I belong
                    Fa#
And you belong with me
        Mi            Si
Oh what good is it to live
     Sol#m           Fa#
With nothing left to give
   Mi             Si
Forget but not forgive
                   Fa#
Not loving all you see
     Mi                    Si
The streets you're walking on
  Sol#m            Fa#
A thousand houses long
      Mi               Si
Well, that's where I belong
                    Fa#
And you belong with me
    Mi               Si
Not swallowed in the sea

   Sol#m        Fa#
You belong with me
    Mi               Si
Not swallowed in the sea
      Sol#m           Fa#
Yeah, you belong with me
    Mi               Si
Not swallowed in the sea
