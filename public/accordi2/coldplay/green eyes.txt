 Honey you are a rock
La       Mi        Sim   Sim7
 Upon which I stand
La         Mi             Sim   Sim7
 And I come here to talk
La          Mi         Sim   Sim7
 I hope you understand


                           Re
The green eyes, yeah the spotlight
          La       Mi
Shines upon you
      Sim         Re       La      Mi
And how could anybody deny you
Sim                     Re
  I came here with a load

                       La  Sol          Re
And it feels so much lighter now I met you
Sim                       Re
  And honey you should know
                    La Sol        Re
That I could never go on without you
Sim
Green eyes


La        Mi           Sim   Sim7
 Honey you are the sea
La       Mi        Sim   Sim7
 Upon which I float
La        Mi            Sim   Sim7
 And I came here to talk
La         Mi           Sim   Sim7
 I think you should know


     Sim
The green eyes
             Re                    La    Mi
You're the one that I wanted to find
        Sim                 Re
And anyone who tried to deny you
                     La  Mi
Must be out of their mind
Sim                             Re
  Because I came here with a load

                        La  Sol          Re
And it feels so much lighter since I met you
Sim                       Re
  And honey you should know
                    La Sol      Re  
That I could never go on without you
 Sim
Green eyes, green eyes

       La         Sim                  La
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
