  oh no i see
  Fa            Lam              Sol
a spider web is tangled up with me
      Mim     Sim
and I lost my head
    Fa                 Lam               Sol
and thought of all the stupid things i’d said

Sol  Mim  Sim    Sol  Mim  Sim

Sol  Mim       Sim
  oh no what’s this
  Fa                 Lam                 Sol
a spider web and i’m caught in the middle
     Mim       Sim
so I turned to run and
Fa                 Lam               Sol
thought of all the stupid things i’d done

    La                            Mim7
and ah i never meant to cause you trouble
La                         Mim7
ah i never meant to do you wrong
La                           Mim7
ah well if I ever caused you trouble
La                                  Mim7
 then oh no I never meant to do you harm

Sol  Mim  Sim    Sol  Mim  Sim

Sol  Mim  Sim
  oh no i see
  Fa                  Lam             Sol
a spider web and it’s me in the middle
    Mim        Sim
so i twist and turn
    Fa           Lam              Sol
but here am i in my little bubble

        La                            Mim7
Singing and ah i never meant to cause you trouble
La                         Mim7
ah i never meant to do you wrong
La                           Mim7
ah well if I ever caused you trouble
La                                  Mim7
 then oh no I never meant to do you harm

and they spun a web  for me
