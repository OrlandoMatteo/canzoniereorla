I almost fell into that hole in your life
Do#                              Fa#add9
 And you're not thinking 'bout tomorrow
    La#m7        Sol#/Do  Do#

Do#                     Fa#add9
 I saw the world spin beneath you
    La#m7        Sol#/Do       Do#
And scatter like ice from the spoon
              Sol#4  Fa#
that was your womb

La#m7  Sol#      Fa#         Do#
Comin' down the world turned over
    La#m7  Sol#     Fa#     Do#
And angels fall without you there
    La#m7 Sol#   Fa#    Do#
And I go  on as you get colder
   Fa#    Sol#       Do#  Fa#add9  Do#  Fa#add9
Or are you someone's prayer?

Do#                            Fa#add9
 You know the lies they always told you
Do#                     Fa#add9
 And the love you never knew
Do#                           Fa#add9
 What's the things they never showed you
