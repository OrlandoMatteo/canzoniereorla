        Re        Mim7     Sol
And I'd give up forever to touch you
         Sim7          La          Sol
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
           Re         Mim7        Sol
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
      Sim7          La            Sol
And I don't want to go home right now
    Re        Mim7          Sol
And all I can taste is this moment
    Sim7      La              Sol
And all I can breathe is your life
       Re        Mim7       Sol
'Cause sooner or later it's over
       Sim7          La         Sol
I just don't want to miss you tonight

      Sim7           La       Sol
And I don't want the world to see me
         Sim7             La          Sol
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
     Sim7         La         Sol
When everything's made to be broken
       Sim7        La         Sol
I just want you to know who I am

        Re              Mim7             Sol
And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
       Sim7       La            Sol
Or the moment of truth in your life
     Re         Mim7           Sol
When everything feels like the movies
         Sim7           La          Sol
Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive

      Sim7           La       Sol
And I don't want the world to see me
         Sim7             La          Sol
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
     Sim7         La         Sol
When everything's made to be broken
       Sim7        La         Sol
I just want you to know who I am
