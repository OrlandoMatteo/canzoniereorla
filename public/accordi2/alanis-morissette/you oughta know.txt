I want you to know that I'm happy for you.
Fa#m7                  Si/Fa#
I wish nothing but the best for you both.
        Fa#m7
Another version of me Is she preverted like me?
             Si/Fa#
Would she go down on you in a theatre?
               Fa#m7
Does she speak eloquently? And would she have your baby?
               Si/Fa#
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother.

           Fa#m7
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
                                             Si/Fa#
wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide. No,
    Fa#m7
and everytime you speak her name

does she know how you told me you'd hold me
  Si/Fa#
until you died? 'Til you died, but you're still alive.

        Fa#       Mi
And I'm here to remind you
       La                     Si
of the mess you left when you went away.
         Fa#       Mi
It's not fair to deny me
       La                    Si
of the cross I bare that you gave to me.
Si
You, you, you oughta know.

Fa#m7
You seem very well.
Si/Fa#
Things look peaceful.
Fa#m7
I'm not quite as well.
Si/Fa#
I thought you should know.

           Fa#m7
Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity?
          Si/Fa#
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner.
         Fa#m7
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced,
            Si/Fa#
and are you thinking of me when you fuck her?

           Fa#m7
'Cause the love that you gave that we made
                                            Si/Fa#
wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide. No,
    Fa#m7

  Si/Fa#

        Fa#       Mi

       La                     Si

Cause the joke that you laid in the bed that was me,
                                     Si/Fa#
and I'm not gonna fade as soon as you close your eyes, and you know it.
    Fa#m7
And everytime I scratch my nails down someone else's back
           Si/Fa#
I hope you feel it. Can you feel it?

        Fa#       Mi
And I'm here to remind you
       La                     Si
