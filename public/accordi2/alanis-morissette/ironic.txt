An old man  turned ninety-eight   
            Re   Sol      Re            Mim
He won the lottery and died the next day

Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly
   Re          Sol            Re              Mim
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye
              Re          Sol       Re         Mim
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
           Re             Sol

And then meeting his beautiful wife
              Re    Sol  Re               Mim
And isn´t it ironic ... don´t you think
        Re     Sol                    Re        Mim
