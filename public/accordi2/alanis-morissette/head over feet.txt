 I had no choice  but to hear you

 You stated your case  time and again
  Sol      Lam     Fa
I thought about it
Do   Sol       Lam  Fa         Do
 You treat me like   I'm a princess

I'm not used to    liking that
    Sol        Lam     Fa
You ask how my day was

And don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet
            Re          Sim          Sol          La
Don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are

Fa         Do
I couldn't help it
Sol
It's all your fault

Do    Sol     Lam   Fa                   Do
 Your love is thick and it swallowed me whole
       Sol     Lam    Fa                       Do

 You are the bearer   of unconditional things
    Sol       Lam   Fa                  Do
You held your breath  and the door for me
       Sol       Lam     Fa
