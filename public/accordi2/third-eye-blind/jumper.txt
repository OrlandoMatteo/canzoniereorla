I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend

Lam 
The angry boy, a bit too insane,
Do 
icing over a secret pain,
Sol
You know you don't belong,
Lam
You're the first to fight, you're way to loud,
Do
You're the flash of light, on a burial shroud
Sol
I know something's wrong
Lam                       Do             Sol
Well everyone I know has got a reason, to say, put the past away

Lam 
Well he's on the table and he's gone ta code,
Do 
And I do not think an one know what they are,
Sol 
doing here-er
Lam 
And your friends have left, you've been dismissed,
Do 
I never thougt it would come to this, and
Sol
I, I want you to know-o
Lam                Do             Sol
Everyone's got to face down the demons, maybe today,we can put the past away
