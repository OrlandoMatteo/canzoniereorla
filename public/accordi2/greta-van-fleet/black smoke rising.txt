Mim      Re               Sim   Do
 Did you know there was a tower
           Mim             Re
Where they look out to the land
                  Sim             Do
To see the people quickly passing by
Mim      Re              Sim  Do
 This is for their own desire
        Mim              Re
As they spit down to the earth
                  Sim              Do
To feel the power pouring in their veins
Do7        Si7   Do7  Si7
 Woh ho ho ho ho yeah yeah

 Woh ho ho ho ho yeah yeah

Sol      Re          Do
 And the black smoke rises
Sol       Re               Do
 From the fires we've been told
Sol       Re       Do
 It's the new age crisis
Sol          Re              Do
 And we will stand up in the cold
                Mim
Stand up in the cold

Mim   Re           Sim    Do
 Many people are dividing
      Mim              Re
And a world apart with just one heart
            Sim             Do
Is bound to keel and fade away
Mim      Re           Sim    Do
 None of us will be deciding
        Mim            Re
And the fate of man is in the hands
          Sim                  Do
Of he who stands and heeds the call
Do7        Si7   Do7  Si7
 Woh ho ho ho ho yeah yeah
Do7        Si7   Do7  Si7    Re
 Woh ho ho ho ho yeah yeah

We won't stand alone, we will stand up in the cold
Lam9               Sim11                    Lam9 Sim11
 We won't stand alone, we will stand up in the cold
