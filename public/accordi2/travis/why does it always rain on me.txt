       Mi  Sim7  La La/Sol# Fa#m7 Fa#m7/Mi

Mi                      Do#m
  I can't sleep tonight
                                     Mimaj7
Everybody saying everything's alright
                             Do#m
Still I can't close my eyes
                                            La
I'm seeing a tunnel at the end of all these lights
      Si4     Laadd9
Sunny days
               Si4
Where have you gone?
  La      La/Sol#    Fa#m7 Fa#m7/Mi Si
I get the strangest feeling   you belong

Mi                  Si          La
 Why does it always rain on me?
      Mi/Sol#    Fa#m7            La6/Mi
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?
Mi                  Si
 Why does it always rain on me?
La             Mi/Sol#
 Even when the sun is shining
Fa#m7     La6/Mi         Mi
 I can't avoid the lightning

                     Do#m
I can't stand myself
                                   Mimaj7
I'm being held up by an invisible man
                          Do#m
Still life on a shelf when
                                La
I got my mind on something else
      Si4    Laadd9
Sunny days
               Si4
Where have you gone?
  La      Mi/Sol#    Fa#m7 Fa#m7/Mi Si
I get the strangest feeling   you belong

Do#m              Mi/Si         Do#m
Oh, where did the blue skies go?
              Mi/Si       Re Re/Do# Sim7
And why is it raining so?
     La  Si4  Si
It's so cold

Mi                     Do#m
 I can't sleep tonight
                                     Mimaj7
Everybody's saying everything's all right
