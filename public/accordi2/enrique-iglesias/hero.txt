[<pre>          Sol
Would you dance,
                  Mim
If I asked you to dance?
          Do
Would you run,
               Re
And never look back?
          Sol
Would you cry,
              Mim
If you saw me crying?
          Do       Re      Sol
Would you save my soul tonight?


          Sol
Would you tremble
                  Mim
If I touched your lips?
          Do
Would you laugh,
                  Re
Oh please tell me this.
              Sol
Now would you die,
                Mim
For the one you love.
        Do       Re      Sol
Hold me in your arms tonight.


Sol     Re             Do
I can be your hero, baby.
Sol     Re             Do
I can kiss away the pain.
Sol      Re               Do
I will stand by you forever.
Sol       Re       Do
You can take my breath away.

          Sol
Would you swear,
                      Mim
That you'll always be mine?
          Do
Would you lie,
                   Re
Would you run and hide?
            Sol
Am I in too deep?
               Mim
Have I lost my mind?
        Do            Re      Sol
I don't care, you're here tonight.


Sol     Re             Do       Sol
I can be your hero, baby.
Sol     Re             Do       Sol
I can kiss away the pain.
Sol      Re               Do      Sol
I will stand by you forever.
Sol       Re               Do
You can take my breath away.


Oh, I just want to hold you

I just want to hold you
                     Sol
Oh yeah, Am I in too deep?
               Mim
Have I lost my mind?
             Do            Re      Sol
Well I don't care, you're here tonight.
