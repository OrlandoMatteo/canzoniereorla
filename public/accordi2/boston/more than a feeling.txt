I looked out this morning and the sun was gone,
Re                      Sol/Do   Sol/Si  Sol
turned on some music to start my day,
     Re               Sol/Do   Sol/Si  Sol
Then lost myself in a familiar song,
  Re                   Sol/Do         Sol/Si
I closed my eyes and I slipped away...

It's more than a feeling (more than a feeling),
       Sol           Do        Mim          Re
when I hear that old song they used-to-play (more than a feeling)
    Sol     Do       Mim          Re
And I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)

'til I see Marianne walk a-way,
Mim7       La4      La       Sol    Sol  Sol/Fa#  Sol/Mi
  I see my Marianne walking away.

So many people have come and gone,
      Re                Sol/Do   Sol/Si   Sol
their faces fade as the years go by
    Re                Sol/Do    Sol/Si   Sol
Yet I still recall as I wonder on,
   Re                      Sol/Do     Sol/Si
as clear as the sun in the summer sky...

When I'm tired I'm thinking cold,
  Re                   Sol/Do  Sol/Si   Do
I hide in my music, forget the day
    Re                Sol/Do      Sol/Si   Sol
And dream of a girl I used to know,

I closed my eyes and I slipped away...
