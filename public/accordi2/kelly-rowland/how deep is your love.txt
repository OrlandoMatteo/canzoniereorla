I know your eyes in the morning sun
Do7         Fam7             Sol7      Sol#maj7/La#
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
        Re#              Solm7    Dom7
And the moment that you wander far from me
        Fam7                  Sol#maj7/La#
I wanna feel you in my arms again


        Sol#maj7          Solm7
And you come to me on a summer breeze
        Fam7                         Do#maj7
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
         Solm7            Sol#maj7/La#               Re# 
And it's me you need to show, how deep is your love?

Re#   Solm7      Fam7
 I believe in you

You know the door to my very soul
           Re#          Solm7     Dom7
You're the light in my deepest darkest hour
          Fam7            Sol#maj7/La#
You're my saviour when I fall


        Sol#maj7          Solm7
And you may not think I care for you
         Fam7                     Do#maj7
When you know down inside that I really do
