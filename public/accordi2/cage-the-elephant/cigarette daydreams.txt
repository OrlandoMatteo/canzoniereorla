Re                         Remaj7
 Did you stand there all alone
   Mim          Sol             La      Re
Oh, I cannot explain what's goin' down
                         Remaj7
I can see you standin' next to me
Mim          Sol          La         Re
In and out somewhere else right now
       Remaj7       Sim
You sigh   look away
Sol             La        Re
I can see it clear as day
               Remaj7         Sim
Close your eyes    so afraid
 Sol                La    Re
Hide behind that baby face


Re       Remaj7       Sim  Mim
Doot do do, doot-do do

[Chorus 1]
Sim              Re            Sol
   You can drive   all night
                Fa#m                      Sim
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
               Re               Sol
You wanna find   peace of mind
Fa#m
Lookin' for the answer

 Funny how it seems like yesterday
   Mim        Sol                La       Re
As I recall you were lookin' out of place
                              Remaj7
Gathered up your things and slipped away
    Mim            Sol              La      Re
No time at all I followed you into the hall
      Remaj7       Sim
Cigarette daydream
 Sol             La     Re
You were only seventeen
   Remaj7                   Sim
So sweet with a mean streak
 Sol                 La       Re
Nearly brought me to my knees


Re       Remaj7       Sim  Mim
Doot do do, doot-do do


Sim               Re            Sol

Sim                     Re                   Sol
  If we could find a reason, a reason to change
