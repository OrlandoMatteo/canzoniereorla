Mi               Sim7     La
 It's funny how I find myself,
   Mi             Sim7  La
In love with you
Mi                 Sim7  La
 If I could find my reasoning,
  Mi            Sim7  La
I pray to lose
    Fa
But that won't do

La#m  Re#m  Sol#  Do#

      Fa#                     La#m Re#m  Sol# Do#
And I ask myself, How much do you
   Fa#
commit yourself?

        La#m  Re#m  Sol#
It's my life,
      Do#    La#m  Re#m  Sol#
Don't you forget!
Do#     La#m  Re#m  Sol#
It's my life,
   Do#   La#m  Re#m  Sol#  Do#  Fa#
It never ends

Mi               Sim7      La
 It's funny how I blind myself,
  Mi           Sim7  La
I never knew,
Mi                Sim7      La
 If I was sometimes played upon,
 Fa
Afraid to lose

La#m  Re#m  Sol#  Do#

  Fa#                      La#m  Re#m  Sol#  Do#
I tell myself, What could you do?
   Fa#
Convinced myself,

        La#m  Re#m  Sol#
It's my life,
      Do#    La#m  Re#m  Sol#
Don't you forget!
Do#     La#m  Re#m  Sol#
It's my life,
   Do#   La#m  Re#m  Sol#  Do#
It never ends
