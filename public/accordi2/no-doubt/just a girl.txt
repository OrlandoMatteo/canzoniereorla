Re   Sim       La#    La    Re Sim La#
Take this pink ribbon off my eyes
La    Re   Sim  La#     La    Re Sim La#
I'm exposed and it's no big surprise
La        Re      Sim   La#     La    Re Sim La# La
Don't you think I know exactly where I stand
     Re       Sim     La#   La      Re  Sim La# La
This world is forcing me to hold your hand

       Sim        La      Sol         La
'Cause I'm just a girl, a little 'ol me
     Sim          La      Sol   La
Well don't let me out of your sight
   Sim        La        Sol           La
Oh I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite
   Sim          La     Sol    La
So don't let me have any rights
Sol       Do          Re Sim La# La    Re Sim La# La
Oh...I've had it up to here!

    Re    Sim La#    La      Re Sim La#
The moment    that I step outside
   La   Re   Sim    La#   La     Re Sim La#
So many reasons for me to run and hide
        La     Re     Sim   La# La     Re Sim La#
I can't do the little things I  hold so dear
            La        Re     Sim   La# La   Re Sim La# La
'Cause it's all those little things    that I fear

       Sim        La       Sol         La
'Cause I'm just a girl I'd rather not be
            Sim          La          Sol  La
'Cause they won't let me drive late at night
   Sim        La              Sol           La
Oh I'm just a girl, guess I'm some kind of freak
           Sim          La           Sol   La
'Cause they all sit and stare with their eyes
   Sim        La           Sol           La
Oh I'm just a girl, take a good look at me
          Sim     La   Sol   La
Just your typical prototype
Sol       Do            Sim  La  Sol  La
Oh...I've had it up to here!

Sim  La  Sol  La  Sim  La/Do#  Sol/Re  La/Mi

Sol       Do           Re Sim La# La  Re Sim La# La
Oh...am I making myself clear?
Re  Sim    La# La   Re Sim La# La
I'm just a girl
Re  Sim    La#  La     Re Sim La# La
I'm just a girl in the world...
       Re  Sim  La#   La    Re Sim La# La
That's all that you'll let me be!

Sim        La           Sol        La
I'm just a girl, living in captivity
             Sim            La     Sol  La
Your rule of thumb makes me worry some
Sim        La         Sol        La
I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?
          Sim             La      Sol  La
What I've succumbed to is making me numb
   Sim        La       Sol   La
Oh I'm just a girl, my apologies
            Sim     La     Sol  La
What I've become is so burdensome
   Sim        La    Sol    La
Oh I'm just a girl, lucky me
        Sim         La      Sol  La
Twiddle-dum there's no comparison
Sol       Do
Oh...I've had it up to!
Sol       Do
Oh...I've had it up to!
Sol       Do          Sim
Oh...I've had it up to here!
