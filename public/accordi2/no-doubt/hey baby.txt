I’m the kinda girl that hangs with the guys

Like a fly on the wall with my secret eyes

Takin it in, try to be feminine

With my makeup bag watchin all the sin

Misfit, I sit

Lit up, wicked

Everybody else surrounded by the girls

With the tank tops and the flirty words
Mim
I’m just sippin on chamomile
                                  Si
Watching boys and girls and their sex appeal
       Mim
With a stranger in the face who says he knows my mom
    Sol        Si
And went to my high school


All the boys say,
Mim

All the boys get the girls in the back

Mim
I’m the one they feed upon

Give a bit a star is born

And if you're hot enough you'll get the pass

And you can tell your friends how you made it back

No matter what they say I’m still the same
                        Si
Somehow everybody knows my name
    Mim
And all the girls wanna get with the boys
        Sol         Si
And the boys really like it
