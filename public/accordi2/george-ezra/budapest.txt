[<pre>Sol
My house in Budapest

My hidden treasure chest,
Sol
Golden grand piano

My beautiful Castillo
Do
For you, You
             Sol
I’d leave it all
Sol
My acres of a land I have achieved
Sol
It may be hard for you to stop and believe
Do
But for you, You
              Sol
I’d Leave it all


 Re
Give me one good reason
    Do                      Sol
Why I should never make a change
Re
And baby if you hold me
      Do                   Sol
Then all of this will go away


Sol
My many artifacts

The list goes on
Sol
If you just say the words

I’ll up and run
Do
Oh, to you,  You
             Sol
I’d leave it all

Sol
My friends and family They, don’t understand

They fear they’d lose so much If, you took my hand
Do
 But, for you, You
              Sol
I’d lose it all.
