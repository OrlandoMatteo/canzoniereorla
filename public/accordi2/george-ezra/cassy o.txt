Gotta get herself away

Well, I'd better act quick
          Sol    La        Re
Yeah, I'd better change my ways

Oh, maybe I'm wasting
          Re4    Re
Maybe I'm chasing time

Oh, come on, let's face it
    Sol       La      Re
I'm only ever lost in mine
        Sol            La
Well, I got my tracing paper
        Sol              La
So that I could trace my clock
        Sol               La
And the bastard face kept changing
        Re
And the hands, they wouldn't stop
      Sol             La
I was ripping out the battery
    Sol             La
I received myself a shock
       Sol           La
And to add insult to injury
        Re
I could still hear tick &amp; tock

Gotta get herself a break

And I try, I try, I try

For heaven's sake

Well, I traveled to Australia
      Sol               La
And I traveled there by train
     Sol                   La
This something might sound strange to you
           Re
But on the way I gained a day
      Sol              La
And I wrote to tell my family
      Sol              La
And I wrote to tell my friends
    Sol                La
I arrived home, it was lost again

And this torture never ends

Inspector, fix me, my Cassy O's burnt out
      Sol    La            Sim        Fa#m
We're losing memories that I can't replace
    Sol        La          Sim         Fa#m
She says she's tired of me running in circles
    Sol       La        Sim        Fa#m
She says it's time that we took a break
