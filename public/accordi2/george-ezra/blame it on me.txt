The garden was blessed by the Gods of me and you
                                                  Dom
We headed west for to find ourselves some truth, ooh
                 Sol#
What you waiting for?

No, what you waiting for?

We counted all our reasons, excuses that we made

We found ourselves some treasure,
                        Dom
and threw it all away, ooh
                 Sol#
What you waiting for?

When I dance alone, and the sun's bleeding down,
           La#
Blame it on me

When I lose control and the veil's overused,

Caught in the tide of blossom, caught in the carnival
                                                    Dom
Your confidence forgotten, I see the gypsies roll, ooh
