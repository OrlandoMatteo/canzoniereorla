Hey
                  Domaj7
This is a story I hate
                             Do7
And tellin' it might make me break
                 Fa      Sol/Si
But I'll tell it anyway
               Do
This chapter's about
                              Domaj7
How you said there was nobody else
                                Do7
Then you got up and went to her house
                        Fa   Sol/Si
You guys always left me out

  Domaj7
I still have the letter you wrote 
when you told me
     Sol/Si                           
That I was the only girl you'd ever 
                Rem7
want in your life
                        Fam
I guess my friends were right

              Rem7                  Sol7
Each day goes by and each night, I cry
         Domaj7                 Fa
Somebody saw you with her last night
                 Rem7                     Sol7
You gave me your word, "Don't worry 'bout her"
                   Domaj7                 Do7
You might love her now, but you loved me first
                 Rem7                  Sol7
Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are
        Domaj7    Sol/Si    Lam
Oh, you swore on every star
              Rem7   Sol7               Domaj7
How could you be so reckless with my heart?

                 Do
You check in and out
                     Domaj7
Of my heart like a hotel
                            Do7
And she must be perfect, oh well
                      Fa   Sol/Si
I hope you both go to hell

   Domaj7

How could you be so reckless with 
    Domaj7 La7Â 
my heart? (Heart)

              Rem7   Sol7
How could you be so reckless?
              Domaj7 Sol/Si Lam
How could you be    so  reckless?
              Rem7   Sol7        
How could you be so reckless with 
            Domaj7
someone's heart?

This is a story I hate
                               Do7
But I told it to cope with the pain
                        Fa
I'm so sorry if you can relate</pre>]
