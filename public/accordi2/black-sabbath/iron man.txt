Has he lost his mind?

Can he see or is he blind?

Is he alive or dead?

Has he thoughts within his head

riff...

We'll just pass him there

Why should we even care?

He was turned to steel

In the great magnetic field

When he travelled time

For the future of mankind

Nobody wants him

He just stares at the world

Planning his vengeance

That he will soon unfold

Riff...

Now the time is here

For Iron Man to spread fear

Vengeance from the grave

Kills the people he once saved

Nobody wants him

They just turn their heads

Nobody helps him

Now he has his revenge


Heavy boots of lead

Fills his victims full of dread

Running as fast as they can

Iron Man lives again!
