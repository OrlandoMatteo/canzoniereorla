Re     Do Sol  Re Do Sol
I like to dream,     yes yes
Re      Do        Sol          Re Do Sol
Right between the sound machine
     Re       Do      Sol
On a cloud of sound I drift in the night
Re     Do        Sol
 every place she goes is right
Re     Do  Sol        Re      Do      Sol
 Flies far, flies near to the stars away from here

Re        Do    Sol      Re  Do  Sol
Well, you don't know what we can find
Re            Do        Sol
Why don't you come with me little girl
Re    Do    Sol
 on a magic carpet ride
    Re    Do    Sol       Re  Do  Sol
Well, you don't know what  we can see
Re            Do        Sol
Why don't you tell your dreams to me
Re     Do    Sol
fantasy will set you free

Sol
 Close your eyes girl
La#
 Look inside girl
Do                       Sol
 Let the sound take you away

     Re      Do     Sol
Last night I found Aladdin's lamp
Re           Do   Sol
 so I wished that I could stay
Re             Do          Sol
But before the thing could answer me
Re      Do                Sol
someone came and took the lamp away
Re Do    Sol       Re    Do       Sol
 I looked around a lousy candle's all I found

Re        Do    Sol      Re  Do  Sol
Well, you don't know what we can find
Re            Do        Sol
Why don't you come with me little girl
Re    Do    Sol
 on a magic carpet ride
    Re    Do    Sol       Re  Do  Sol
Well, you don't know what  we can see
Re            Do        Sol
Why don't you tell your dreams to me
Re     Do    Sol
fantasy will set you free

Sol
 Close your eyes girl

 Look inside girl
Do                       Sol
 Let the sound take you away
