Get your motor runnin'

Head out on the highway

Lookin' for adventure

In whatever comes our way

Sol    La            Mi
 Yeah, darlin' gonna make it happen
Sol       La         Mi
 Take the world in a love embrace
Sol   La         Mi
 Fire all of the guns at once
  Sol  La        Mi
and explode into space

Mi7#9
I like smoke and lightnin'

Heavy metal thunder

Wrestlin' with the wind

And the feelin' that I'm under

Sol    La            Mi
 Yeah, darlin' gonna make it happen
Sol       La         Mi
 Take the world in a love embrace
Sol   La         Mi
 Fire all of the guns at once
  Sol  La        Mi
and explode into space

Mi
Like a true nature's child
        Sol
We were born, born to be wild
         La           Sol             Mi
We could climb so high, I never wanna die
Mi         Re   Mi  Re
Born to be wild,
Mi         Re   Mi  Re
Born to be wild,
