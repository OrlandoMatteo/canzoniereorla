We'll do it all, everything, on our own.
La          Mi/Sol#       Re             La
We don't need anything, or anyone.

Would you lie with me, and just forget the world.

I don't quite know how to say how I feel
La              Mi/Sol#               Re                 La
Those three words, I said too much, but not enough.

Forget what we're told, before we get too old

Show me a garden that's bursting into life.

Let's waste time, chasing cars, around our heads.
La              Mi/Sol#          Re                   La
I need your grace to remind me, to find my own.

I don't know where, confused about how as well

just know that these things will never change for us at all.
