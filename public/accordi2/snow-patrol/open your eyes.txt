       Sol  Doadd9  Mim7  Doadd9

       Sol  Doadd9  Mim7  Doadd9

Sol              Doadd9
  All this feels strange and untrue
      Mim7                   Doadd9     Sol
And I won't waste a minute without you
               Doadd9
My bones ache, my skin feels cold
        Mim7                    Doadd9  Sol
And I'm getting so tired and so old
          Doadd9
The anger swells in my guts
      Mim7                         Doadd9  Sol
And I won't feel these slices and cuts
                  Doadd9
I want so much to open your eyes
         Mim7                  Doadd9  Sol
'Cause I need you to look into mine

                    Doadd9          Mim7
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
                    Doadd9          Sol
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
                    Doadd9          Mim7
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
                    Doadd9
Tell me that you'll open your eyes

Sol                    Doadd9
 Get up, get out, get away from these liars
            Mim7                        Doadd9  Sol
'Cause they don't get your soul or your fire
                        Doadd9
Take my hand, knot your fingers through mine
          Mim7                             Doadd9    Sol
And we'll walk from this dark room for the last time
                  Doadd9
Every minute from this minute now
       Mim7               Doadd9  Sol
We can do what we like anywhere
                  Doadd9
I want so much to open your eyes
         Mim7                  Doadd9  Sol
'Cause I need you to look into mine

                    Doadd9          Mim7
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
                    Doadd9          Sol
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
                    Doadd9          Mim7
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
                    Doadd9          Sol
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
                    Doadd9          Mim7
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
                    Doadd9          Sol
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
                    Doadd9          Mim7
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
                    Doadd9
Tell me that you'll open your eyes

Sol  Doadd9  Mim7  Doadd9  Sol  Doadd9  Mim7  Doadd9

Sol  Doadd9  Mim7  Doadd9  Sol  Doadd9  Mim7  Doadd9

Sol  Doadd9  Mim7  Doadd9  Sol  Doadd9  Mim7  Doadd9

Sol              Doadd9
  All this feels strange and untrue
      Mim7                   Doadd9
And I won't waste a minute without you
