[<pre>Lam                             Sol
I'll sing it one last time for you
        Lam             Sol
Then we really have to go
                 Lam                Sol
You've been the only thing that's right
             Lam        Sol                   
In all i've done.

            Lam            Sol           
And I can barely look at you
            Lam           Sol            
But every single time I do
              Lam            Sol         
I know we'll make it anywhere
             Lam       Sol               
Anywhere from here


Do
Light up, Light up
          Sol
As if you have a choice 
                   Lam
Even if you cannot hear my voice
                         Fa
I'll be right beside you dear

Do                                   
Louder, louder
                   Sol                
And we'll run for our lives
                         Lam          
I can hardly speak I understand
                                   Fa
Why you can't raise your voice to say


              Lam                 Sol    
To think I might not see those eyes
              Lam              Sol       
It makes it so hard not to cry
           Lam               Sol         
And as we say our long goodbyes
          Lam               Sol          
I nearly do.


Do
Light up, Light up
          Sol
As if you have a choice 
                   Lam
Even if you cannot hear my voice
                         Fa
I'll be right beside you dear

Do                                   
Louder, louder
                   Sol                
And we'll run for our lives
                         Lam          
I can hardly speak I understand
                                   Fa
Why you can't raise your voice to say


Do                            Sol
Slower, Slower. We dont have time for that.
                        Lam
All I want is to find an easier way.
                           Fa 
To get out of our little heads.
Do                                   Sol
Have heart, my dear. We're bound to be afraid.
                     Lam     
Even if its just for a few days.
                           Fa 
Makin' up for all of this mess.


Do
Light up, Light up
          Sol
As if you have a choice 
                   Lam
Even if you cannot hear my voice
                         Fa
I'll be right beside you dear</pre>]
