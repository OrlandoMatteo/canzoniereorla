[<pre>Mim                   Sol6 
No one knows what it's like 
  Resus2
To be the bad man 
  Doadd9
To be the sad man 
  Lasus2
Behind blue eyes 
    Mim                      Sol6
And no one knows what it's like 
  Resus2
To be hated 
  Doadd9
To be fated 
  Lasus2
To telling only lies 

        Doadd9 
But my dreams 
     Re          Sol  
They aren't as empty 
      Doadd9      Re        Mi   Mi4  Mi  Mi4   Mi    
As my conscience seems to be 
       Sim          Doadd9 
I have hours, only lonely 
           Re              
My love is vengeance 
              Lasus2
That's never free 
 

Mim                   Sol6 
No one knows what it's like 
  Resus2
To feel these feelin's 
  Doadd9
Like I do 
  Lasus2
And I blame you 
 Mim                      Sol6
No one bites back as hard 
 Resus2
On their anger 
 Doadd9
None of my pain an' woe 
  Lasus2
Can show through 


        Doadd9 
But my dreams 
     Re          Sol  
They aren't as empty 
      Doadd9      Re        Mi   Mi4  Mi  Mi4   Mi    
As my conscience seems to be 
       Sim          Doadd9 
I have hours, only lonely 
           Re              
My love is vengeance 
              Lasus2
That's never free

Discover    L.I.M.P     Say it

Mim                   Sol6 
No one knows what it's like 
  Resus2
To be mistreated 
  Doadd9
To be defeated 
  Lasus2
Behind blue eyes 
Mim                   Sol6 
And no one knows how to say
  Resus2
That they're sorry 
  Doadd9
An' don't worry 
  Lasus2
I'm not telling lies 


        Doadd9 
But my dreams 
     Re          Sol  
They aren't as empty 
      Doadd9      Re        Mi   Mi4  Mi  Mi4   Mi    
As my conscience seems to be
