She sits alone by a lam-post
Do                                           Sol 
Trying to find a thought that's escaped her mind

She says "Dad's the one I love the most."
Do                   Sol
But Stipe's not far behind

She never lets me in    only tells me where she's been
Do                         Sol
when she's had to much to drink
Sol                                Re
I say that I don't care   I just run my hands through her dark hair
Do                                          Sol
then I pray to God, "You gotta help me fly away"   (and just)


        Do              Sol
let her cry     if the tears fall down like rain

let her sing    If it eases all her pain
        Do               Sol
let her go      let her walk right out on me

This morning I woke up alone    found a note standing by the phone
Do                             Sol 
saying "maybe, maybe I'll be back someday"
Sol                               
I wanted to look for you
           Re
you walked in, I didn't know just what I should do
      Do                                   Sol
