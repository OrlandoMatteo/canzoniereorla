       Do  Fa Do Fa Do Sol

       Do  Fa Do Fa Do Sol

Fa             Do
 Whistles the wind
Fa          Do
 Blowin' my way
Fa           Do                 Sol
 Sweepin' me back, back here to stay
Fa              Do
 Can winners be losers?
Fa                   Do
 Runnin' on the same track
Fa                   Do               Sol
 While some head for glory, others we crash

        Do                 Fa           Do
Well it breaks my heart to see you this way
    Fa        Do              Sol
The beauty in life where's it gone
    Do                        Fa     Do
And somebody told me you were doin' okay
    Fa        Do              Sol
But somehow I guess they were wrong

Fa     Do
 My isolation
Fa                      Do
 Now there's a sobering thought
Fa         Do                   Sol
 A minute alone, a lifetime too long
Fa                    Do
 See the face in this mirror
Fa                Do
 So pale it could crack
Fa           Do                   Sol
 Desperately wantin' the color it lacks

        Do                 Fa           Do
Well it breaks my heart to see you this way
    Fa        Do              Sol
The beauty in life where's it gone
    Do                        Fa     Do
And somebody told me you were doin' okay
    Fa        Do              Sol
But somehow I guess they were wrong
       Fa
So you drank with the lost souls
    Do
for too many years
Fa                             Do
Time to be right cause they'll cripple with fear
Fa                          Lam
Never been righteous though seldom were wrong
Sol
Life's only life with you in this song

Do  Fa  Rem  Sol

Lam  Fa  Rem  Sol

Fa                       Do
 Now there's an ocean between
Fa                     Do
 Where I am and where I  want to be
Fa                 Do
 So you prayers in doubt
              Sol
Doubt not for me

        Do                 Fa           Do
Well it breaks my heart to see you this way
    Fa        Do              Sol
The beauty in life where's it gone
    Do                        Fa    Do
And somebody told me you were doin'okay
    Fa        Do              Sol
But somehow I guess they were wrong
        Do                 Fa           Do
Well it breaks my heart to see you this way
    Fa        Do              Sol
The beauty in life where's it gone
    Do                        Fa    Do
And somebody told me you were doin'okay
    Fa        Do              Sol
But somehow I guess they were wrong
Fa            Do
 Whistles the wind
Fa            Do
 Whistles the wind
Fa            Do
 Whistles the wind
Fa            Do
 Whistles the wind
              Fa
Though you'll find your way out
            Do
But there's no goin' now
      Fa
Every woman and child
          Do
Drags you down for the dive
         Fa
It's not safe being free
           Lam
Can't give back what you feel
               Sol                      Do
He said you'll always be in heaven with me
