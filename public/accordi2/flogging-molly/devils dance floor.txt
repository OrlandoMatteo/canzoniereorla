       Lam  Do Mim  Lam  Do Mi Lam


Her breath began to speak

As she stood right in front of me

The colour of her eyes

Were the colour of insanity

Crushed beneath her wave

Like a ship, I could not reach her shore
Lam                           Mi
We're all just dancers on the Devil's Dance Floor

     Lam                         Do            Mim
Well swing a little more, little more o'er the merry-o
Lam                           Do           Mi
Swing a little more, a little more next to me
Lam                         Do            Mim
Swing a little more, little more o'er the merry-o
Lam                         Do      Mi     Lam
Swing a little more, on the Devil's Dance Floor

Lam
Pressed against her face

I could feel her insecurity

Her mother'd been a drunk

And her father was obscurity

But nothin' ever came

From a life that was a simple one
Lam
So pull yourself together girl
    Mi
And have a little fun
         Lam
Well she took me by the hand

I could see she was a fiery one

Her legs ran all the way

Up to heaven and past Avalon

Tell me somethin' girl, what it is you have in store
         Lam
She said come with me now
       Mim
On the Devil's Dance Floor

     Lam                         Do            Mim
Well swing a little more, little more o'er the merry-o
Lam                           Do           Mi
Swing a little more, a little more next to me
Lam                         Do            Mim
Swing a little more, little more o'er the merry-o
Lam                         Do      Mi     Lam
Swing a little more, on the Devil's Dance Floor
                            Do      Mi     Lam
Swing a little more, on the Devil's Dance Floor

    Lam
The apple now is sweet

Oh much sweeter than it ought to be

Another little bite

I don't think there is much hope for me

The sweat beneath her brow

Travels all the way

An' headin' south
     Lam
This bleedin' heart's cryin'
              Mi
Cause there's no way out

     Lam                         Do            Mim
Well swing a little more, little more o'er the merry-o
Lam                           Do           Mi
Swing a little more, a little more next to me
Lam                         Do            Mim
Swing a little more, little more o'er the merry-o
