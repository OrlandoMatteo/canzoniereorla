       Mim         Sim
Oh the night is my world
     Mim             Sim
City lights, painted girls
       Re          Lam7
In the day nothing matters
         Do              Sol
It’s the night time that flatters
       Mim         Sim
In the night no control
            Mim            Sim
Through the wall something breakin’
        Re              Lam7
Wearin’ white as you’re walkin’
           Do         Sol
Down the street of my soul

Mim                           Sim
You take my self, you take my self control
Mim                    Sim
You got me livin’ only for the night
Re                           Lam7
Before the morning comes the story’s told
Do                            Sol
You take my self, you take my self control
Mim                    Sim
Another night, another day goes by
Mim                    Sim
I never stop myself to wonder why
Re                         Lam7
You’re makin’ me forget to play my role
Do                           Sol
You take my self you take my self control
Mim  Sim                             Mim
I, I live among the creatures of the night
  Sim                             Re
I haven’t got the will to try and fight
 Lam7
Against a new tomorrow
     Do                               Sol
So i guess I'll just believin' that tomorrow never comes again

Mim        Sim                     Mim
Night, I’m livin’ in a moment of a dream
  Sim                               Re
I know the night is not as it would seem
  Lam7
I must believe in something
        Do                              Sol
So I'll make myself believin’ that this night will never go

A safe night, I live among the creatures of the night
