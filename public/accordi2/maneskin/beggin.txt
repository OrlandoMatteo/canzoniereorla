Ridin' high, when I was king
Mim                   Fa#7
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
Sim            Sol
I walked away, you want me then
Mim               Fa#7
But easy come and easy go

And it would end

So, any time I need ya, let me go

Yah, any time I feed you, get me? No

Only then can I begin to live again

Sim
An empty shell

I used to be
Mim
The shadow of my life
Fa#7
Was hangin over me
Sim
A broken man
Sol
But I don't know
Mim                    Fa#7
Won't even stand the devil's dance

To win my soul


 Sim
What we doin'? What we chasin'?
 Sol
What about 'em, why the basement?
 Mim
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
 Fa#7
Why the feel for the need to replace me?

You on a runway track from the good

I want to paint in the pictures any way we could, react
         Mim
Like the heart in a trash where you should

You done gave it away, ya' had it till you took it back

Keep rockin' dawns

Keep walking forward

Now the court is yours

Keep browsin' halls
