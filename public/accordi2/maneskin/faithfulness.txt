Faithfulness

Distracts me from my ever changing
Sol6
Tastefulness

My mouth upon the richest tongues
  Fa
I run for this
                              Rem9
Static at the same time by it all
Lam9
Common sense

Can slap me in the face
          Sol6
And yet I condescend

Embarrassed by your obvious
  Fa
Indifference
                                 Rem9
Disgusted at the same time by it all
                               Lam  Lam7 Sol
Watching as my ego breaks your fall

Rem
Don't you know that I've
     Fa
Been running from your heart
      Lam                   Fa6     Lam
And I feel like you've been running too
Rem
Don't you know that I've
     Fa
Been lying from the start
      Lam       Sol#dim           Lam
And I feel like you've been lying too

Lam9
Leave you now

Can't convince myself
                Sol6
That you're the one somehow

To free me from this smile
          Fa
I call my loneliness
                                  Rem9
Stuck inside this need to feel complete
                                   Lam  Lam7 Sol Mi7
Now I've left you standing on your feet

Rem
Don't you know that I've
     Fa
Been running from your heart
      Lam                   Fa6     Lam
And I feel like you've been running too
Rem
Don't you know that I've
     Fa
Been lying from the start
      Lam       Sol#dim           Lam
And I feel like you've been lying too

Fa              Rem           Do/Mi
Faithfulness is just a little rule
    Do7+/Mi
We break
Fa               Rem             Do/Mi
Still pretending lust was just a fool
     Do7+/Mi  Famaj7
We faked,   me made
Rem                   Fa  Lam Lam/Sol#  Lam
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah...
Rem                   Fa  Lam Lam/Sol#  Lam
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah...
