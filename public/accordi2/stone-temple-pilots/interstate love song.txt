Waiting on a Sunday afternoon
    Do#m/Si                    Fa#/La#
For what I've read between the lines
     La    Mi
Your lies
Do#m           Sol#/Do
Feeling like a hand in rusted chains
   Do#m/Si                 Fa#/La
So do you laugh or does it cry

Leaving on a Southern train

Only yesterday you lied
La                 Mi
Promises of what I seemed to be
     La                  Sol#4 Sol#
Only watched the time go by
La                      Mi
All of these things you said to me

With all I've said and all that's dead for
