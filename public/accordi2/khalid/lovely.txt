Do
Thought I found a way
Mim                       Sim
Thought I found a way, out (out)
     Do
But you never go away (never go away)
     Mim                  Sim    
So I guess I gotta stay now


                 Do                Mim     Sim
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
            Do                    Mim      Sim
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
                 Do                 Mim       Sim
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
             Do                   Mim       Sim
Wanna feel alive, outside I can fight my fear


Do
Isn't it lovely, all alone
Mim                      Sim
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Do
Tear me to pieces, skin and bone
Mim        Sim           Do
   Hello, welcome home


Do
Walkin' out of time
Mim                           Sim
Lookin' for a better place (lookin' for a better place)
Do
Something's on my mind
Mim                      Sim
Always in my headspace


                 Do                Mim     Sim
But I know some day I'll make it out of here
            Do                    Mim      Sim
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
                 Do                 Mim       Sim
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
             Do                  Mim       Sim
