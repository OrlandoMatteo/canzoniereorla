Dom          Sol#
 Risin' up, back on the street
La#                    Dom
 Did my time, took my chances
Dom                          Sol#
 Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
         La#                    Dom
Just a man and his will to survive

So many times, it happens too fast
La#                     Dom
You trade your passion for glory
Dom                           Sol#
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
         La#                    Dom
You must fight just to keep them alive
