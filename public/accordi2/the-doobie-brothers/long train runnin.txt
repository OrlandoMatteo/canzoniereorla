Down around the corner, half a mile from here

See them long trains run, and you watch them disappear

Without love, where would you be now
        Re#   Re4 Re Solm7

You know I saw miss Lucy down along the tracks

She lost her home and her family and she won't be coming back

        Dom7                     Solm7
Without love, where would you be now
        Re#   Re4 Re Solm7

         Solm7
Well the Illinois Central
        Solm7
And the Southern Central Freight
       Solm7
Got to keep on pushin' mama
    Solm7
You know they're running late

        Dom7                     Solm7
Without love, where would you be now

Well the pistons keep on turning
    Fa  Solm7
And the wheels go round and round
Fa  Solm7
The steel rails are cold and hard
Fa      Solm7
For the miles that they go down
