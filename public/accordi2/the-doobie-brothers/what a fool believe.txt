       Fa6/Sol  Sol/Fa  Do/Mi  Rem7  Sol7sus4 Lam7

             Fa6/Sol    Sol/Fa      Do/Mi     Rem7
He came from somewhere  back in her long ago
    Fa/Sol      Lam7       Solm11
The sentimental fool don't see
       Fa6/Sol  Sol/Fa
Trying hard  to recreate
         Do/Mi            Rem7 Fa/Sol      Lam7
What had yet to be created     once in her life
    Solm11   Fa6/Sol   Sol/Fa
She musters a smile
           Do/Mi       Rem7
For his nostalgic tale
Fa/Sol       Lam7         Solm11   Fa6/Sol  Sol/Fa
Never coming near what he wanted to say
        Do/Mi   Rem7
Only to realize
   Fa/Sol       Lam7
It never really was

Lam7                   Sol7sus4 Sol
She had a place in his life
Lam7                  Sol7sus4  Fa6/Sol
He never made her think twice
                    Domaj7
As he rises to her apology
La7     Rem7       Sol7sus4 Lam7
Anybody else would surely know
                  Fa#m7b5
He's watching her go

                  Fam7      La#7sus4
But what a fool believes he sees
            La#7    Re#              Dom7
No wise man has the power to reason away
     Fam7     La#7sus4
What seems to be
          La#7        Re#
Is always better than nothing
               Dom7  Lam7b5
And nothing at all

keeps sending him

Fa/Sol                Do/Mi     Rem7
Somewhere back in her long ago
      Fa/Sol         Lam7            Solm11      Fa6/Sol
Where he can still believe there's a place in her life
 Sol/Fa  Do/Mi    Rem7 Fa/Sol     Lam7
Someday, somewhere,    she will return

Lam7                   Sol7sus4 Sol
She had a place in his life
Lam7                  Sol7sus4  Fa6/Sol
He never made her think twice
                    Domaj7
As he rises to her apology
La7     Rem7       Sol7sus4  Lam7
Anybody else would surely  know
                  Fa#m7b5
He's watching her go

                  Fam7      La#7sus4
But what a fool believes he sees
            La#7    Re#             Dom7
No wise man has the power to reason away
     Fam7     La#7sus4
What seems to be
          La#7        Re#
Is always better than nothing
               Dom7   Fam7   La#7sus4
And nothing at all...
