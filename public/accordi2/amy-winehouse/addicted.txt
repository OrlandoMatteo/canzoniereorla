 Tell your boyfriend, next time he around,
   Mim7                        Rem7
To buy his own weed and don't wear my shit down.


Lam
 I wouldn't care if bre would give me some more.
Mim7
 I'd rather him leave you then leave him my draw.

When you smoke all my weed man,
    Mim7               La7
You got's to call the Green Man.
   Rem7            Sol7           Domaj7  Sol4  Sol
So I can get mine, and you get yours.



Domaj7               Rem7
 Once is enough, to make me attack,
   Mim7                     Rem7
So bring me a bag and your man can come back.



Lam
 I'll check him at the door; make sure he got green,
Mim7
 I'm tighter than Airport Security teams.

 I'm my own man, so when will you learn,
     Mim7               Rem7
That you got a man but I got's to burn?



Lam
 Don't make no difference if I end up alone;
Mim7
 I'd rather have myself a-smoke my home grown.
