Domaj7        Rem7
 He can only hold her for so long,
Mim7                    Rem7
 The lights are on but no-one's home.

Domaj7              Rem7
 She is so vacant, her soul is taken,
Mim7                    Rem7
 He thinks; what's she running from?


     Domaj7               Rem7 
Now, how can he have her heart, 
        Mim7     Rem7
when it got stole?
      Domaj7
So he tries to pacify her,
Rem7                         Lam  Rem7
 'Cos what's inside her never dies.

Domaj7              Rem7
 Even if she's con-tent in his warmth,
Mim7                    Rem7
 She gets plagued with her urgency.

Domaj7               Rem7
 Urgent kisses, the miss misses,
Mim7              Rem7
 The man that he longs to be.
