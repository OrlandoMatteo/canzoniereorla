[<pre>Do6                        Si7#9
 You're just a little boy, underneath that hat,
    C                                 La7+           La7b9
You need your nerve to hide your ego; don't come with that.

Bridge 1:

Rem7                        Fam7
 You think everything gets handed to you free.
Mim7                   La7sus4  La7b9
 But it's not that ea-sy,    no.


  Rem9                        Sol7b9
I gotta know you now; we may never meet again.
  Domaj9          Solaug     Domaj9  Solaug
I gotta know you now, and then.



Do6                          Si7#9
 My girl says I'm too sensi-tive to ride with you,
Do                         La7+  La7b9
 But I'm not listening to her,  mmm hmm.



Rem7                      Fam7
 Yes, I'm perceptive, so when I've done with you;
Mim7                                    La7sus4 La7b9
 You'll wish your head back the way it were,   as you were.

Chorus 2:

  Rem9                        G7b9
I gotta know you now; we may never meet again.
  Domaj9          Solaug     Domaj9  Solaug
I gotta know you now, and then.



Do6  Si7#9, Do  La7+  La7b9


Rem7                         Fam7
 Oh, I'm not ruling you out, I'm just in doubt,
Mim7                              La7sus4  A7b9 (n.Do)
 As to what you say you're all a-bout,     yeah.


  Rem9                        Sol7b9
I gotta know you now; we may never meet again.
  Domaj9          Solaug     Domaj9  Solaug
I gotta know you now, and then.
  Domaj9          Solaug     Domaj9  Solaug
I gotta know you now, and then.


  Domaj9          Solaug        Domaj9        Solaug
I gotta know you now; we may never meet a-gain.
  Domaj9          Solaug        Domaj9        Solaug
I gotta know you now; we may never meet a-gain.
  Domaj9          Solaug        Domaj9        Solaug
I gotta know you now; we may never meet a-gain.
  Domaj9          Solaug        Domaj9        Solaug
I gotta know you now; we may never meet a-gain.
