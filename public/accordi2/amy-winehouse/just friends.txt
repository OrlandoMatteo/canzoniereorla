 When will we get, the time to be,
Lamaj9          Sim7/La
 Just friends?


Sim7
 It's never safe for us,
Mi7               Lamaj9         Remaj7
 Not even in the evening; 'cos I've been drinking.
Fa#7                                 Sim7
 Not in the morning, when your shit works.

Sim                     Mi7
 It's always dangerous,
                 Lamaj9        Remaj7
When everybody's sleeping and I've been thinking.
Fa#7                      Sol
 Can we be alone, can we be alone?


Lamaj9             Rem6
 When will we get, the time to be,
Lamaj9          Rem6
 Just friends?
Lamaj9             Rem6
 When will we get, the time to be,
Lamaj9          Rem6
 Just friends?


Sim7                     Mi7
 And no I'm not ashamed,
                            Lamaj9         Remaj7
But the guilt will kill you, if she don't first.
Fa#7                  Sim7
 I'll never love you like her.

Sim7                         Mi7
 Though we need to find the time,
                        Lamaj9       Remaj7
To just do this shit to-gether; for it gets worse.
Fa#7                               Sol
 I wanna touch you, but that just hurts.


Lamaj9             Rem6
 When will we get, the time to be,
Lamaj9          Rem6
 Just friends?
Lamaj9             Rem6
 When will we get, the time to be,
Lamaj9               Rem6
 Just friends, just friends?

Lamaj9             Rem6
 When will we get, the time to be,
Lamaj9               Rem6
 Just friends, just friends?

Lamaj9             Rem6
 When will we get, the time to be,
Lamaj9               Rem6           Lamaj9
 Just friends, just friends, just friends?</pre>]
