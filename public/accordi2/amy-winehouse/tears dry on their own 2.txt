Mi6/Si                            La#m7b5
 All I can ever be to you, is a darkness that we knew,
    Lamaj7          Sol#m7  Fa#m9     Mi/Fa# La Fa#/La#
And this regret I got ac-customed to
Mi6/Si                         La#m7b5
 Once it was so right, when we were at our high,
Lamaj7            Sol#m7   Fa#m9       Mi/Sol# La Fa#/La#
Waiting for you in the ho-tel at night
         Mi6/Si                      La#m7b5
I knew I hadn't met my match, but every moment we could snatch
  Lamaj7            Sol#m7 Fa#m9       Mi/Sol# La Fa#/La#
I don't know why I got  so attached
        Mi6/Si                        La#m7b5
It's my responsibility, and you don't owe nothing to me,
       Lamaj7        Sol#m7      Fa#m9   Sol#m7
But to walk away I have no ca-pacity

Lamaj7        Fa#m Sol#m7     Do#m
 He walks a-way    the sun goes down
Lamaj7 Fa#m        Sol#m7        Do#m
  He takes the day, but I'm grown
       Lamaj7     Fa#m      Sol#m7 Do#m
And in your grey, in this blue shade,
   Fa#7         Sol#m La
My tears dry on their own

Mi6/Si                La#m7b5
I don't understand why do I stress a man,
     Lamaj7            Sol#m7 Fa#m9         Mi/Sol# La Fa#/La#
When there's so many better things at hand?
           Mi6/Si          La#m7b5
We could a never had it all we had to hit a wall,
   Lamaj7       Sol#m7     Fa#m9     Mi/Sol# La Fa#/La#
So this is in-evita-ble withdrawal
        Mi6/Si                   La#m7b5
Even if I stop wanting you, a per-spective pushes through,
     Lamaj7         Sol#m7      Fa#m9     Mi/Sol# La Fa#/La#
I'll be some next man's other woman soon
        Mi6/Si                       La#m7b5
I can't play myself again, I should just be my own best friend,
    Lamaj7        Sol#m7         Fa#m9        Sol#m7
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men

Lamaj7        Fa#m Sol#m7     Do#m
 He walks a-way    the sun goes down
Lamaj7 Fa#m        Sol#m7        Do#m
  He takes the day, but I'm grown
       Lamaj7     Fa#m      Sol#m7 Do#m
And in your grey, in this blue shade,
   Fa#7         Sol#m La
My tears dry on their own
   La/Si
So we are history

your shadow covers me, the sky above, a blaze...

Sol#4 Sol#     Do#m7
 He  walks away the sun goes down
Lamaj7
 He takes the day, but I'm grown
       Si7
And in your grey, in this blue shade, my tears dry on their own

  Mi6/Si                             La#m7b5
I wish I could say no regrets, and no e-motional debts,
     Lamaj7            Sol#m7  Fa#m9     Mi/Sol# La Fa#/La#
'Cos as we kiss good-bye the sun sets
   Mi6/Si             La#m7b5
So we are history the shadow covers me,
    Lamaj7        Sol#m7      Fa#m9         Sol#m7
The sky above a blaze that only lovers see

Lamaj7        Fa#m Sol#m7     Do#m
 He walks a-way    the sun goes down
Lamaj7 Fa#m        Sol#m7        Do#m
  He takes the day, but I'm grown
       Lamaj7     Fa#m      Sol#m7 Do#m
And in your grey, in this blue shade,
   Fa#7         Sol#m La
My tears dry on their own

Lamaj7        Fa#m Sol#m7     Do#m
 He walks a-way    the sun goes down
Lamaj7 Fa#m        Sol#m7        Do#m
  He takes the day, but I'm grown
       Lamaj7     Fa#m      Sol#m7 Do#m
And in your grey, in this blue shade,
   Fa#7         Sol#m La
My tears dry on their own...
