 I can't wait to get away from you,
Mim7                            Sol7   Sol13
 And surprisingly, you hate me too.
Lam7              La#m7      Sim7        Mi7
 We only communi-cate when we need to fight,
Lam7                         Re9
 But we are best friends... right?


       Solmaj7                            Si7
You're too good at pretending you don't care,
Mim7                               Sol7  Sol13
 There's enough resentment in the air.
    Lam7                           La#m7 Sim7 
Now you don't want me in the flat when you're 
          Mi7
home at night,
Lam7                      Re9     Re7
 But we're best friends, right?


Solmaj7                  Fa#m7
 You're Stephanie, and I'm Paulette;
Si7                          Mim7
 You know what all my faces mean.
Solmaj7                      Fa#m7       Fam7
 And it's easy to smoke it up; forget,
Mim7                             La13   Re7
 Everything that happened in be-tween.


Solmaj7                                Si7
 Nickyâ€™s right, when he says I can't win,
   Mim7                        Sol7    Sol13
So I don't wanna tell you any-thing.
Lam7                           Sim7         Mi7
 I can't even think about how you feel in-side,
Lam7                     Re9     Re7
 But we're best friends right?


Solmaj7                            Si7
 I don't like the way you say my name,
       Mim7                         Sol7   Sol13
You're always looking for someone to blame.
Lam7                         La#m7      Sim7  
 Now you want me to suffer, just 'cos you were 
       Mi7
born white,
Lam7                     Re9     Re7
 But we're best friends right?


Solmaj7                  Fa#m7
 You're Stephanie, and I'm Paulette;
Si7                          Mim7
 You know what all my faces mean.
Solmaj7                      Fa#m7       Fam7
 And it's easy to smoke it up; forget,
Mim7                             La13   Re7
 Everything that happened in be-tween.


   Solmaj7                          Si7
So I had love for you, when I was four,
    Mim7                               Sol7   Sol13
And there's no one I wanna smoke with more.
     Lam7                    La#m7 Sim7         Mi7
Some-day I'll buy the Rizla,  so you get the draw.


Lam7          Re9            Solmaj7
 'Cos we are best friends, right, right, 
right, right?
   Lam7          Re9   Solmaj7
Be-cause we are best friends, right?
   Lam7          Re9   Solmaj7
Be-cause we are best friends, right?
