  I couldn't resist him
                      Domaj7-Do#maj7-Remaj7
  His eyes were like yours
                                    Domaj7
  His hair was exactly the shade of brown
  Mim7
  He's just not as tall
  Re#maj7
  But I couldn't tell
  Remaj7            Remaj7-Do#maj7-Domaj7
  It was dark and I was lying down


  Remaj7            Remaj7-Do#maj7-Domaj7
  You are everything
                      Domaj7-Do#maj7-Remaj7
  He means nothing to me
                            Domaj7
  I can't even remember his name
  Mim7
  Why're you so upset?
  Re#maj7
  Baby, you weren't there
     Remaj7                          Lam6
  And I was thinking of you when I came


Fa#m7             Sim7
  What do you expect?
              Mim7
  You left me here alone
  La7
  I drank so much
      Sol7             
  And needed to touch
Fa#m7          Sim7
  Don't overreact
              Mim7
  I pretended he was you
      La7
  You wouldn't want me
  Sol7
  To be lonely


Remaj7        Remaj7-Do#maj7-Domaj7     
  How can I put it so you understand?
Domaj7-Do#maj7-Remaj7
                           Domaj7
  I didn't let him hold my hand
         Mim7
  But he looked like you
          Re#maj7
  Yes, he looked like you
Remaj7   Domaj7
  No he wasn't you
      Mim7
  But you can still trust me
  Re#maj7
  This ain't infidelity
  Remaj7             Remaj7-Do#maj7-Domaj7
  It's not cheating, you were on my mind


          Mim7
  Yes, he looked like you
      Re#maj7          Remaj7
  But I heard love is blind...</pre>]
