[<pre>Fadim7


Domaj7    Fa/Sol
 For you I was a flame,
Fam7         Domaj7
 Love is a losing game
Domaj7              Fa/Sol
 Five story fire as you came,
Fam7         Domaj7
 Love is a losing game

[Chorus 1]
Lam7        Rem7
 One I wish I never played,
Fam7         Domaj7
 Oh, what a mess we made
Domaj7         Fa/Sol
 And now the final frame,
Fam7         Domaj7
 Love is a losing game
Fadim7


Domaj7         Fa/Sol
 Played out by the band,
Fam7         Domaj7
 Love is a losing hand
Domaj7       Fa/Sol
 More than I could stand,
Fam7         Domaj7
 Love is a losing hand


Lam7
 Self professed,
Rem7
 Profound,
Fam7              Domaj7
 Till the chips were down
Domaj7           Fa/Sol
 Know youâ€™re a gambling man,
Fam7         Domaj7
 Love is a losing hand
Fadim7


Domaj7         Fa/Sol
 Though I'm rather blind,
Fam7         Domaj7
 Love is a fate resigned
Domaj7       Fa/Sol
 Memories mar my mind,
Fam7         Domaj7
 Love is a fate resigned


Lam7    Rem7
 Over futile odds,
Fam7            Domaj7
 And laughed at by the gods
Domaj7         Rem7
 And now the final frame,
Fam7        Do
 Love is a losing game</pre>]
