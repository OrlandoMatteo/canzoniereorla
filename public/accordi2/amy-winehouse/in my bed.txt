 Wish I could say it breaks my heart, like you did in the beginning.
Lam7b5                    Re7#9 Solm
 It's not that we grew a-part; a nightingale no longer singing.


Lam7b5             Re7#9              Solm
 It's something I know you can't do; separate sex with emotion.
Lam7b5              Re7#9         Solm
 I sleep alone the sun comes up, you're still clinging to that notion.

Bridge 1:

Remaj7  Re#maj7          Remaj7               Re#maj7       Remaj7
        Every thing is slowing down; river of no return.
     Re#maj7         Remaj7                   Re7#9
Reco-gnise my every sound, there is nothing new to learn.



Lam7b5                                 Re7#9
 You'll never get my mind right, like two ships passing in the night,
Solm
 In the night, in the night.
Lam7b5                              Re7#9
 Want the same thing where we lay, otherwise mines a different way,
  Solm
A different way from where I'm going.

Lam7b5                Re7#9
 Oh, it's you again, listen; this isn't a reunion;
   Solm
So sorry if I turn my head.
Lam7b5                          Re7#9
 Yours is a familiar face, but that don't make your place safe,
   Solm
In my bed, my bed, my bed.

 I never thought my memo-ry, of what we had, could be intruded.
Lam7b5                  Re7#9  Solm
 But I couldn't let it be; I needed it as much as you did.



Lam7b5                      Re7#9   Solm
 Now its not hard to under-stand, why we just speak at night.
Lam7b5            Re7#9            Solm
 The only time I hold your hand, is to get the angle right.
