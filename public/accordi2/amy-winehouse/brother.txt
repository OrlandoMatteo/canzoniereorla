 Brother;
Lam7                   Re7      Solmaj7        Mi7sus4    Mi7
 There's so much that I could never say to your face.
    Lamaj7
But by now,
Lam7                  Re7                Solmaj7 Mi7sus4       Mi7
 You should know the world and all its ways; so find your place.


Lamaj7                            Lam7        Re7
 How do I find words that do not condescend,
         Solmaj7       Mi7sus4   Mi
When she bore you be-fore me?
Lamaj7                               Lam7            Re7
 'Cos she doesn't need a child; she needs a friend.
  Solmaj7              Mi7sus4  Mi7
A son, not a sob sto-ry.     (Ooh, ooh, hoo).


Lamaj7                               Lam7             Re7
 Now you must look out for her, the way she did for you.
    Solmaj7                     Mi7sus4  Mi7
And your priority; it must be her.
Lamaj7                               Lam7             Re7
 Now you must look out for her, the way she did for you.
Solmaj7                           Mi7sus4  Mi7
 'Cos we'll never be the way we were.    (Ooh, ooh, hoo).


Lamaj7      Lam7              Re7               Solmaj7 Mi7sus4     Mi7
 She can't always be there, just to hold you down; our mother.
     Lamaj7   Lam7            Re7                 Solmaj7  Mi7sus4     Mi7
When you are at an age now, where life turns a-round, my brother.


Lamaj7
 Realise;
                       Lam7          Re7
That you don't have to answer to no man,
   Solmaj7                      Mi7sus4  Mi7
Re-sponsibility comes down to you.
Lamaj7                        Lam7        Re7
 But how can I expect you to understand,
     Solmaj7                            Mi7sus4   Mi7
When you live life like you're so run through?


Lamaj7                               Lam7             Re7
 Now you must look out for her, the way she did for you.
    Solmaj7                     Mi7sus4  Mi7
And your priority; it must be her.

Solmaj7                           Mi7sus4  Mi7
 'Cos we'll never be the way we were.

Lamaj7            Lam7     Re7
 The way we were,  we'll never be.
Solmaj7       Mi7sus4    Mi7
 (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh).

             Lamaj7            Lam7  Re7
And your pri-ority it must be her.
Solmaj7       Mi7sus4  Mi7
 (Ooh, ooh, hoo).
