Rem                         Solm
 Meet you downstairs in the bar and heard,
     La7                        Rem
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
                               Solm
You say why did you do it with him today?
    La7                     Rem
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray
Solm
 'Cos you're my fella, my guy,
Mi7
 Hand me your Stella and fly
Fa
 By the time I'm out the door,
    Mi7               La7
You tear me down like Roger Moore

Rem               Lam
 I cheated myself,
       Mi7    Lam
Like I knew I would
  Rem            Lam
I told ya, I was trouble
    Mi7              Lam
You know that I'm no good

Rem                   Solm
 Upstairs in bed with my ex boy,
La7                      Rem
 He's in the place but I can't get joy
                        Solm
 Thinking of you in the final throws
La7              Rem
 This is when my buzzer goes
Solm
 Run out to meet your chips and bitter,
Mi7
 You say when we're married 'cos you're not bitter
Fa
 There'll be none of him no more,
  Mi7                  La7
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

Rem               Lam
 I cheated myself,
       Mi7    Lam
Like I knew I would
  Rem            Lam
I told ya, I was trouble
    Mi7              Lam
You know that I'm no good

Rem  Lam  Mi7  Lam

Rem  Lam  Mi7  Lam

Rem                Solm
 Sweet reunion, Ja-maica and Spain
La7                Rem
 We're like how we were again
                    Solm
 I'm in the tub you on the seat,
La7                  Rem
 Lick your lips as I soak my feet
Solm
 Then you notice lickle carpet burn,
Mi7
 My stomach drops yeah and my guts churn
Fa
 You shrug and it's the worst,
   Mi7             La7
To truly stuck the knife in first

Rem               Lam
 I cheated myself,
       Mi7    Lam
Like I knew I would
  Rem            Lam
I told ya, I was trouble
    Mi7              Lam
You know that I'm no good

Rem               Lam
 I cheated myself,
       Mi7    Lam
Like I knew I would
  Rem            Lam
I told ya, I was trouble
    Mi7              Lam
You know that I'm no good
