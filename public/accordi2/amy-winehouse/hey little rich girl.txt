I bought you a fur coat when you were fifteen
                   Dom                        La#
You wore it to the disco, where everyone was in jeans

    Re#              Fa               La#     Solm
But you were just a rich girl, only having fun
Re#              Fa            La#               Solm
  Your worn out dresses, got stares from everyone
Re#          Fa                       La#        La#  
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong? 

             Dom                    La#
You left for London, when you were nineteen 
                     Dom                          La#
Had to pull off your nice clothes, just living on dreams 
             Dom                          La#
A man in the bright lights took all that you own 
                    Dom                    La#
Now he's taken your freedom for a taste unknown 

    Re#         Fa               La#     Solm       
But you were a rich girl, only having fun 
Re#              Fa                La#               Solm
  Your worn out dresses, brought stares from everyone 
Re#                 Fa                  La#        La#
  Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong? 

Re#            Dom       Solm                      Fa
  Hey, little rich girl you've been away for so long
Re#                Dom        Solm                             
  And now, little rich girl, I wrote you in this song
Re#            Dom         Solm            Fa
  Hey, little rich girl, maybe love is gone
Re#                Dom         Fa                  Fa 
  And now, little rich girl, I know where you belong

                     Dom                   La#
At your dad's office party all the movies were blue 
           Dom                                     La#
Caused him so much heart ache, because the screen star was you 
            Dom                     La#
You left for London, when you were nineteen 
                     Dom                                   La#
Had to pull off your nice clothes, but you were living on dreams

Re#               Fa                  La#        Solm
Hey, little rich girl where did you go wrong? 
Re#               Fa                  La#        La#
