[<pre>Mi    Fa#m7   La    2x


Do#m             Sol#m    Fa#m
Running down my batteries
Do#m        Sol#m      Fa#m
Laying me out to rest
Do#m              Sol#m       Fa#m
Knowing when that in five hours
Do#m        Sol#m      Fa#m
I wake up into stress
Mi                        La
And I'm digging myself into a hole
Mi
And these days I just work
   La
On when one song had so much soul


     Mi      Fa#m      La7
And lately I've forgotten who I am
 Mi      Fa#m      La7
Need to let my energy just drain away
     Mi      Fa#m      La7
And now my mind is working overtime
      Re#m7  Sol#7   Do#m    Sol#m   Fa#m
It's been a lo.... ng day
         Do#m Sol#m  Fa#m
Such a long day, ay, ay


    Do#m             Sol#m    Fa#m
And while all my contemporary 
(all my friends say)
Do#m             Sol#m    Fa#m
Are sitting in college now 
(sitting in a desk)
Do#m       Sol#m    Fa#m
My education is dragging, dragging 
(yeah yeah)
Do#m           Sol#m    Fa#m
My guitar through London town
Mi                              
And the thing that wakes me when 
          La
I could sleep instead
 Mi
Is the thought that tonight
   La
I could fall back into bed


  Mi          Fa#m     La7
And lately, I've forgotten who I am
  Mi     Fa#m     La7
Need to let my energy just drain away
     Mi    Fa#m     La7
And now my mind is working overtime
            Re#m7  Sol#7    Do#m 
It's been a lo.......ng day     
Sol#m Fa#m
          It's been a long day
Re#m7   Sol#7        Do#m
       Recently my head
Re#m7   Sol#7        Do#m
       It ain't recharged as such
Re#m7   Sol#7        Do#m
       And sleep can only cure, yeah
    Re#m7          Sol#
A restless mind so much</pre>]
