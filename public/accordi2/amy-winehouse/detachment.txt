[<pre>Lam7                               Famaj7
I did it, it's finished, it's over and done
Do                            Mi7
Now I want to sit back don't wait for the phone
Lam7                 Famaj7
Like a finger to the strings
      Do         Mi7
You'd wail if I said these things
Lam7               Famaj7
Have to lay awake guilty, watch you sleep
Do                                     Mi7
Or would you take me in your arms and weep?
Rem7                   Lam7
I'm culpable for your scornful ways
    Rem7               Lam7
And I can still taste better days
    Rem7         Lam7
Now maybe it is for the best,
    Rem7       Mi7
 I've lost interest
Lam7                               Famaj7
I did it, it's finshed, it's over and done
Do                            Mi7
Now I want to sit back don't wait for the phone

It changed you...</pre>]
