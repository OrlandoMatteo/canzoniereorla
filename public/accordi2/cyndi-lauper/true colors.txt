Lam              Sol
You with the sad eyes
Do              Fa9
Don't be discouraged
Rem Rem7   Do
Oh I realize
        Sol
It's hard to take courage
Do           Rem
In a world full of people
    Do          Fa
You can lose sight of it all
        Lam             Sol
And the darkness inside you
        Fa             Do
Can make you feel so small


                  Fa     Do
But I see your true colors
    Sol
Shining through
            Fa   Do
I see your true colors
       Fa          Do
And that's why I love you
Lam            Mim      Sol         Fa
So don't be afraid to let them show
      Do    Fa
Your true colors
  Do    Fa          Sol
True colors are beautiful,
         Fa
Like a rainbow

Show me a smile then,
 Do          Fa9     Rem    Rem7
Don't be unhappy, can't remember
 Do         Sol
When I last saw you laughing
Do              Rem
If this world makes you crazy
     Do                   Fa
And you've taken all you can bear
     Lam     Sol
You call me up

Because you know I'll be there

                  Fa     Do
And I'll see your true colors

Shining through
            Fa   Do
I see your true colors
       Fa          Do
And that's why I love you

Your true colors

True colors are beautiful,
