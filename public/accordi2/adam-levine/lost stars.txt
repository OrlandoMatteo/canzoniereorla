Famaj7
Please don't see just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
Famaj7
Please see me reaching out for someone I can see
         Mim                              Famaj7
Take my hand let's see where we wake up tomorrow
           Mim                                   Famaj7
Best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand
         Mim                              Famaj7
I'll be damned Cupid's demanding back his arrow
             Sol4    Sol
So let's get drunk on our tears and


Famaj7            Do                             Famaj7
God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
               Do                             Famaj7
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
                Mim
Searching for meaning
            Re                         Rem           Sol4 Sol
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?


Famaj7
Who are we? Just a speck of dust within the galaxy
Famaj7
Woe is me if we're not careful turns into reality
           Mim                                   Famaj7
Don't you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow
   Mim                         Famaj7
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer
          Mim                               Famaj7
Turn the page maybe we'll find a brand new ending
            Sol4      Sol
Where we're dancing in our tears and

Famaj7              Do                           Famaj7
God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
               Do                             Famaj7
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
                Mim
Searching for meaning
            Re                         Rem           Sol4 Sol
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?


Famaj7                           Do
I thought I saw you out there crying
Famaj7                          Do
I thought I heard you call my name
Famaj7                          Do
I thought I heard you out there crying
          Sol4  Sol
Just the same


Famaj7              Do                           Famaj7
God, give us the reason youth is wasted on the young
               Do                             Famaj7
It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run
