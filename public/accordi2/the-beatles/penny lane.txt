In Penny Lane there is a   barber  showing photographs
         Si        Si/La#  Sol#m7   Si/Fa# Sim7
Of every head he's had the pleasure to   know
            Sol#m7b5            Solmaj7          Fa#7sus4  Fa# Fa#7sus4 Fa#
And all the people that come and go,  stop and say hello
       Si     Si/La# Sol#m7 Si/Fa#  Do#m7  Fa#7sus4 Fa#
On the corner is a   banker with a  motorcar,
           Si       Si/La#    Sol#m7 Si/Fa# Sim7
The little children laugh at him behind   his back
        Sol#m7b5             Solmaj7       Fa#7sus4  Fa#  Mi
And the banker never wears a mack in the pouring rain, very strange

La                Laadd9        Re               Fa#7sus4     Fa#
There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit, and mean while back

In Penny Lane there is a  fireman with an   hourglass
           Si     Si/La# Sol#m7  Si/Fa#  Sim7
And in his pocket is a  portrait of the Queen
            Sol#m7b5             Solmaj7        Fa#7sus4  Fa#   Fa#7sus4 Fa#
He likes to keep his fire engine clean, It's a clean machine

A four of fish and finger pie in summer, meanwhile back

           Si      Si/La#  Sol#m7 Si/Fa# Do#m7   Fa#7sus4 Fa#
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
           Si       Si/La#  Sol#m7  Si/Fa# Sim7
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
             Sol#m7b5              Solmaj7         Fa#7sus4 Fa#   Fa#7sus4 Fa#
And tho' she feels as if she's in a play, she is anyway

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another  customer
           Si      Si/La#  Sol#m7  Si/Fa# Sim7
We see the banker sitting waiting  for a trend
              Sol#m7b5     Solmaj7       Fa#7sus4     Fa# Mi
And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain,  very strange
