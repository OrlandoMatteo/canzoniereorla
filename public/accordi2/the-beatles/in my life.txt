There are places I'll remember
       Re Rem        La
All my life though some have changed
        La    Mi       Fa#m    La7/Sol
Some forever not for better
          Re Rem     La
Some have gone and some remain


          Fa#m               Re
All these places have their moments
     Sol                    La
With lovers and friends I still can recall
         Fa#m               Si
Some are dead and some are living
   Rem           La
In my life I've loved them all


       La         Mi           Fa#m    La7/Sol
But of all these friends and lovers
         Re  Rem     La
There is no one compares with you
          La        Mi          Fa#m    La7/Sol
And these memories lose their meaning
       Re        Rem      La
When I think of love as something new


         Fa#m                    Re
Though I know I'll never lose affection
    Sol                      La
For people and things that went before
  Fa#m                             Si
I know I'll often stop and think about them
   Rem        La
In my life I love you more
