  Lam          Lam/Sol         Fa#m7b5            Famaj7
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
Lam            Sol          Re Re4 Re Resus2 Re Mi4 Mi
  While my guitar gently weeps
  Lam          Lam/Sol         Fa#m7b5       Famaj7
I look at the floor, and I see it needs sweeping
Lam            Sol          Do     Mi
  Still my guitar gently weeps

[Chorus 1]
La              Do#m  Fa#m        Do#m
  I don't know why      nobody told you
Sim                   Mi Mi4 Mi
  How to unfold your love
La              Do#m  Fa#m            Do#m
  I don't know how      someone controlled you
Sim                     Mi Mi4 Mi
  They bought and sold you


  Lam          Lam/Sol         Fa#m7b5      Famaj7
I look at the world, and I notice it's turning
Lam            Sol          Re Re4 Re Resus2 Re Mi4 Mi
  While my guitar gently weeps
     Lam       Lam/Sol         Fa#m7b5    Famaj7
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Lam            Sol          Do     Mi
  Still my guitar gently weeps

Lam Lam/Sol Fa#m7b5 Famaj7
Lam Sol Do Mi


La              Do#m  Fa#m            Do#m
  I don't know how      you were diverted
Sim                   Mi Mi4 Mi
  You were perverted too
La              Do#m  Fa#m            Do#m
  I don't know how      you were inverted
Sim               Mi Mi4 Mi
  No one alerted you


  Lam          Lam/Sol         Fa#m7b5            Famaj7
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
Lam            Sol          Re Re4 Re Resus2 Re Mi4 Mi
  While my guitar gently weeps
Lam          Lam/Sol       Fa#m7b5       Famaj7
Look at you all...
Lam            Sol          Do     Mi
  Still my guitar gently weeps
