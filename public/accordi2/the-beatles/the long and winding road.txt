Dom                   Sol#/La#
The long and winding road
     Re#   Re#7     Sol#
that leads to your door
     Solm        Dom
will never disappear
Fam             La#7    Re#  Do#/Re#
 I've seen that road before
Sol# Solm   Dom
 It always leads me her
Fam      La#7   Re#
 Lead me to you door
    Dom              Sol#/La#
The wild and windy night
         Re#  Re#7    Sol#
that the rain washed away
    Solm   Dom
Has left a pool of tears
Fam7    La#7    Re#  Do#/Re#
 crying for the day
Sol#  Solm      Dom
 Why leave me standing here
Fam7    La#7     Re#
 let me know the way

Re#/La#         Sol#
Many times I've been alone
    Re#/Sol         Fam7   La#7
and many times I've cried
Re#/La#        Sol#
Any way you'll never know
    Re#/Sol        Fam7   La#7
the many ways I've tried

    Dom                 Sol#/La#
But still they lead me back
       Re#  Re#7     Sol#
to the long winding road
    Solm     Dom
You left me waiting here
Sol#      La#7      Re#  Do#/Re#
 a long long time ago
Sol#    Solm     Dom
 Don't leave me standing here
Fam7     La#7    Re#
 lead me to your door

Re#/La#  Sol#  Re#/Sol  Fam7  La#7

Re#/La#  Sol#  Re#/Sol  Fam7  La#7

    Dom                 Sol#/La#
But still they lead me back
       Re#  Re#7     Sol#
to the long winding road
    Solm       Dom
You left me waiting here
Fam7     La#7       Re#  Do#/Re#
  a long long time ago
Sol#    Solm        Dom
 Don't leave me standing here
Fam7     La#7    Re#
 lead me to your door
Sol#/La#       Re#
    Yeah yeah yeah
