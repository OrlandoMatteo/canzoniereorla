       Re         Do    Sol
In the town where I was born
Mim     Lam     Do        Re7
Lived a man who sailed to sea
Sol    Re      Do     Sol
And he told us of his life
Mim    Lam     Do     Re7
In the land of submarines
Sol   Re        Do     Sol
So we sailed up to the sun
Mim     Lam       Do     Re7
Till we found the sea of green
Sol    Re      Do        Sol
And we lived beneath the waves
Mim    Lam    Do   Re7
In our yellow submarine

Sol              Re
We all live in a yellow submarine
                  Sol
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
                 Re
We all live in a yellow submarine
                  Sol
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

        Re          Do     Sol
And our friends are all on board
Mim  Lam          Do        Re7
Many more of them live next door
Sol     Re    Do       Sol    Re7
And the band begins to play ...

Sol              Re
We all live in a yellow submarine
                  Sol
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
                 Re
We all live in a yellow submarine
                  Sol
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

Re  Do Sol  Mim Lam  Do Re7

Sol Re  Do Sol  Mim Lam  Do Re7

Sol   Re     Do      Sol
As we live a life of ease
Mim Lam            Do     Re7
Everyone of us has all we need
Sol    Re       Do     Sol
Sky of blue and sea of green
Mim    Lam    Do   Re7
In our yellow submarine

Sol              Re
We all live in a yellow submarine
                  Sol
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
                 Re
We all live in a yellow submarine
                  Sol
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
Sol              Re
We all live in a yellow submarine
                  Sol
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
                 Re
We all live in a yellow submarine
                  Sol
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
