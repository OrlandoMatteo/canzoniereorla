Do        Do/Si          Lasus2
About a lucky man who made the grade
Sol              Sim              Mim   Mim7
And though the news was rather sad
Do           Fa       Mim    Mim7
Well I just had to laugh
Do         Fa       Mim   Do
I saw the photograph


Sol           Sim            Mim   Mim7
He blew his mind out in a car
Do         Do/Si              Lasus2
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
Sol          Sim               Mim      Mim7
A crowd of people stood and stared
Do               Fa
They'd seen his face before
Mim
Nobody was really sure
   Mim7                      Do
If he was from the House of Lords


Sol       Sim            Mim   Mim7
I saw a film today oh boy
Do           Do/Si           Lasus2
The English Army had just won the war
Sol          Sim            Mim   Mim7
A crowd of people turned away
Do          Fa          Mim
But I just had to look
       Mim7      Do
Having read the book
            N.C
I'd love to turn you on


Mi
Woke up, fell out of bed
                         Resus2
Dragged a comb across my head
         Mi                  Si7sus4
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
    Mi            Si7sus4             (Si7)
And looking up I noticed I was late (ha ha ha.)
         Mi
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
                        Resus2
Made the bus in seconds flat
         Mi                Si7sus4
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
    Mi                         Si7sus4
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream.


Do Sol        Re La   Mi      Do Sol   Re La  |Mi Re Do Re|
(Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh)

I read the news today oh boy
Do             Do/Si                 Lasus2
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
Sol              Sim                Mim    Mim7
And though the holes were rather small
Do           Fa
They had to count them all
Mim                              Mim7                      Do
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
             N.C
I'd love to turn you on.</pre>]
