When I was younger, so much younger than today,
                          Re       Sol   La
I never needed anybody's help in any way.
                                Do#m                 Fa#m
But now those days are gone I'm not so self-assured,
                                        Re    Sol       La
Now I find I've changed my mind, I've opened up the door.

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,
                           Re     Sol       La
My independence seemed to vanish in the haze.
                         Do#m                 Fa#m
But every now and then I feel so insecure,
                                        Re    Sol     La
I know that I just need you like I've never done before.
