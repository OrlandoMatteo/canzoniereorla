[<pre>Re                 Sim               Fa#m
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
     Mim7                          La              La7
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Re                Sim               Fa#m
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
  Mim7            Solm
Possessing and caressing me

Re         Sim                 Fa#m                            Mim7
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
                        La            La7
They call me on and on across the universe
Re                Sim              Fa#m
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letterbox
     Mim7                               La              La7
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my opened ears
  Mim7          Solm
Inciting and inviting me
Re            Sim               Fa#m                             Mim7
Limitless, undying love which shines around me like a million suns
                        La            La7
And calls me on and on across the universe
