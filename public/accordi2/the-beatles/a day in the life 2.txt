       Sol  Sim  Mim  Mim7  Do

Sol         Sim          Mim    Mim/Re
 I read the news today, oh boy
Do       Mim/Si        Laadd9        Lam
 About a lucky man who made the grade
Sol             Sim             Mim   Mim/Re
 And though the news was rather sad
Do            Fa          Mim  Mim/Re
 Well, I just had to laugh
Do         Fa         Mim  Do
 I saw the photograph
Sol          Sim           Mim  Mim/Re
 He blew his mind out in a car
Do         Mim/Si          Laadd9             Lam
 He didn't notice that the lights had changed
Sol         Sim              Mim     Mim/Re
 A crowd of people stood and stared
Do               Fa
 They'd seen his face before
Mim
 Nobody was really sure
   Mim/Re                   Do
if he was from the House of Lords

Sol      Sim           Mim   Mim/Re
 I saw a film today, oh boy
Do           Mim/Si        Laadd9     Lam
 The English army had just won the war
Sol         Sim            Mim  Mim/Re
 A crowd of people turned away
Do          Fa           Mim
 But I just had to look
       Mim/Re   Do
Having read the book
            Sim  Sol Lam9  Si4  Do  Readd9
I'd love to turn you on...

Woke up, fell out of bed
                         Re
Dragged a comb across my head
         Mi                 Fa#m7
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
    Mi            La6/Si
And looking up, I noticed I was late
         Mi
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
                        Re
Made the bus in seconds flat
         Mi               Fa#m7
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
    Mi                   La6/Si
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

Do   Sol   Re   La   Mi

Do   Sol   Re   La   Mim  Re Do  Re

Sol            Sim           Mim7   Sol/Re
 Ah I read the news today, oh boy
Do             Mim/Si              Laadd9    Lam
 Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
Sol             Sim               Mim7    Sol/Re
 And though the holes were rather small
Do           Fa
 They had to count them all
Mim                             Sol/Re
Now they know how many holes it takes
                   Do
to fill the Albert Hall
            Sim  Sol Lamadd9 Si4  Do  Readd9
I'd love to turn you on...
