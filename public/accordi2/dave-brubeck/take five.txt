       Lam   Mim7 Lam   Mim7 Lam   Mim7

                   Lam
Won't you stop and take
                  Mim7 Lam
A little time out with me
Mim7      Lam   Mim7 Lam
Just take five
Mim7           Lam
Stop your busy day
                  Mim7
And take the time out
   Lam   Mim7    Lam
To see   if I'm alive

Do7+           Famaj7
Though I'm going out of my way
Rem7          Mim7
Just so I can pass by each day
Lam7         Rem7
Not a single word do we say
Sol7add6      Do
It's a pantomime and not a play
       Do7+          Famaj7
Still, I know our eyes often meet
Rem7           Mim7
I feel tingles down to my feet
Lam7                 Rem7
When you smile, that's much too discreet
Sol7add6   Sim7b5
Sends me on my way
Mi7+         Lam
Wouldn't it be better
          Mim7 Lam
Not to be so polite
Mim7      Lam Mim7 Lam
You could offer  a light
Mim7           Lam
Start a little conversation now
Mim7   Lam    Mim7      Lam
It's alright, just take five
Mim7      Lam
Just take five

Do7+           Famaj7
