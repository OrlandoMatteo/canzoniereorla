        Si
                         Si
Well I guess it would be nice

If I could touch your body
          Mi
I know not everybody
                    Si
Has got a body like you

But I've got to think twice

Before I give my heart away
           Mi
And I know all the games you play
                    Si
Because I play them too

Oh but I
Mi                      Si
Need some time off from that emotion
Mi                                 Si
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
             Mi
Oh when that love comes down
  Si      Sol#m
Without devotion
        Do#m
Well it takes a strong man baby
        Fa#
But I'm showing you the door

                   Si
Cause I gotta have faith,

I gotta have faith

Because I gotta have faith, faith, faith

I gotta have faith, faith, faith

  Si
Baby

I know you're asking me to stay
                    Mi
Say please, please, please don't go away
                           Si
You say I'm giving you the blues

Maybe

You mean every word you say
               Mi
Can't help but think of yesterday
                Si
And another who tied me down to loverboy rules
  Mi
Before this river
  Si
Becomes an ocean
  Mi                                    Si
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
          Mi
Oh baby I reconsider
   Si      Sol#m
My foolish notion
       Do#m
Well I need someone to hold me
         Fa#
But I'll wait for something more

                   Si
Cause I gotta have faith,

I gotta have faith

Because I gotta have faith, faith, faith

I gotta have faith, faith, faith

Si   Mi7   Si      Mi7   Si

  Mi
Before this river
  Si
Becomes an ocean
  Mi                                   Si
Before you throw my heart back on the floor
   Mi
Oh baby I reconsider
   Si      Sol#m
My foolish notion
       Do#m
Well I need someone to hold me
         Fa#
But I'll wait for something more

                   Si
Cause I gotta have faith,

I gotta have faith

Because I gotta have faith, faith, faith

I gotta have faith, faith, faith
