Fa                  Do/Mi  Rem
 I've had enough of danger
                  Fa/Do   Fa7/Do La#
And people on the streets
                    Fa/La   Sol7sus4
I'm looking out for angels
                    Solm7/Do  Do7/Mi  Fa
Just trying to find some peace
                 Do/Mi  Do#dim
Now I think it's time
                Rem   Fa7  La#
That you let me know
                  Fa/La
So if you love me
                Sol7sus4
Say you love me

But if you don't
     Do7sus4  Do7  Fa
Just let me go...
                Do/Mi
'Cause teacher
               Rem
There are things that
                Fa/Do   Fa7/Do La#
I don't want to learn
                   Fa/La
And the last one I had
        Sol7sus4  Do7sus4
Made me cry
     Do7/Mi                 Fa
So I don't want to learn to
                  Do6/Mi  Do#dim
Hold you, touch you
                  Rem   Fa7
Think that you're mine
           La#          Fa/La
Because it ain't no joy
       Sim7b5
For an uptown boy
      La#                    Fa
Whose teacher has told him goodbye,
    La#/Fa Do/Fa Fa
goodbye,     goodbye

                     Do/Mi    Rem
When you were just a stranger
                  Fa/Do  Fa7/Do La#
And I was at your feet
                  Fa/La  Sol7sus4
I didn't feel the danger
           Solm7/Do   Do7 Fa
Now I feel the heat
                  Do/Mi  Do#dim
That look in your eyes
           Rem  Fa7
Telling me "No"
       La#
So you think that you love me
Fa/La                  Sol7sus4
Know that you need me

I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
Solm7/Do    Do7/Mi   Fa
Just let me go...
            Do/Mi
And teacher
                Rem                   Fa/Do  La#
There are things that I don't want to learn
                  Fa/La
Oh the last one I had
Sol7sus4       Solm7/Do
Made me cry

That you'll never leave me
                                        Solm7/Do
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong

             Do/Mi
And teacher
                Rem                   Fa/Do  La#
There are things that I still have to learn
                    Fa/La  Sol7sus4    Solm7/Do
But the one thing I have is my pride
       Do7                      Fa
Oh, so I don't want to learn to

Who just isn't willing to try
    La#/Fa    Fa
I'm so cold inside

Maybe just one more try
