I was mixed up when you came to me
             Fa#maj7
Too broke to fix
                                         La#m
Said 'daddy get you gone, I'm missing my baby'
                 Fa#maj7
Still missing my baby
      La#m
I was stitched up by the hands of fate
     Fa#maj7
Said how you gonna make it on your own
             La#m
If luck is a lady?
                Fa#maj7
Maybe luck is a lady
           Re#m7
I was going down for the third time
         La#m                 Sol#
My heart was broken I was not open
          Re#m7
To your suggestions
              Fa#
I had so many questions
     Fa#6/Sol#
That you just kissed away

La#m                               Fa#maj7
Tell me, I guess that cupid was in disguise
                          Fam7
The day you walked in and changed my life
               Re#m7
I think it's amazing
   Fam7               La#m
The way that love can set you free
                   Fa#maj7
So I walk in the midday sun
                        Fam7
I never thought that my saviour would come
              Re#m7     Fam7

    La#m
You tried to save me from myself
       Fa#maj7
Said 'Darling kiss as many as you want!
                  La#m
My love's still available
                           Fa#maj7
And I know that you are insatiable'
           La#m
We're like victims of the same disease
             Fa#maj7
Look at your Big Bad Daddy, and your mom
      La#m                      Fa#maj7
And your mom... was always acting crazy
           Re#m7
I was going down for the third time

My heart was broken,
               Sol#
I thought that loving you was out of the
Re#m7
question
                Fa#maj7
Then I saw my reflection
       Fa#6/Sol#
Saying please don't let this go

La#m                               Fa#maj7
