For just one moment to be bold and naked at your side

But sometimes love can be mistaken for a crime

That's all I wanted
              Sol#add9           La#add9
Just to see my baby's blue eyes shine

If you are the desert I'll be the sea
            Sol#               Fa#
If you ever hunger hunger for me
