 Heaven knows I was just a young boy
                             Fa/Do  Do  Fa/Do  Do
Didn't know what I wanted to be
      Sol                              Fa
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
                               Fa/Do  Do  Fa/Do  Do
And I guess it was enough for me

On your rock and roll TV
      Sol                                    Fa

No way

I think it's time I told you so
                                 Dom6
There's something deep inside of me

There's someone else I've got to be
                            Fa7

All we have to do now
   Fa                  Do

Well it looks like the road to heaven
       Dom7
But it feels like the road to hell
       Dom7
When I knew which side my bread was buttered

I took the knife as well
 Dom
Posing for another picture
 Dom7
Everybody's got to sell
             Dom7
But when you shake your ass

They notice fast
    Dom6
And some mistakes were built to last
Dom
That's what you get  (That's what you get)
