Rem          Solm7 Lam7 La#maj7
I feel so unsure   as I take your hand and lead you
Lam7               Rem
to the dance floor   As the music dies
Solm7                Lam7 La#maj7
 something in your eyes   Calls to mind a silver screen
    Lam7             Rem
And all it's sad goodbyes

                               Solm7                   Lam7
  I'm never gonna dance again, Guilty feet have got no rhythm,
La#maj7                           Lam7
 Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
Rem
Should have known better than to cheat a friend
    Solm7
And waste the chance that I've been given
La#maj7
  So I'm never gonna dance again
    Lam7                 Rem  Solm7  Lam7 La#maj7  Lam7
The way I danced with you

Rem            Solm7  Lam7
Time can never mend
    La#maj7             Lam7
The careless whispers of a good friend
Rem
 To the heart and mind
Solm7              Lam7
 Ignorance is kind
La#maj7
Thereâ€™s no comfort in the truth
Lam7               Rem
Pain is all you'll find

                               Solm7                   Lam7
  I'm never gonna dance again, Guilty feet have got no rhythm,
La#maj7                           Lam7
 Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
Rem
Should have known better than to cheat a friend
    Solm7                           Lam7
And waste the chance that I've been given
La#maj7
  So I'm never gonna dance again
    Lam7                  Rem  Solm7  Lam7 La#maj7  Lam7
The way I danced with you

Rem   Solm7  Lam7 La#maj7   Lam7

  Rem
Tonight the music seems so loud
  Solm7                        Lam7
I wish that we could lose this crowd
La#maj7
Maybe it's better this way
     Lam7
We'd hurt each other with the things we'd wanna say
   Rem
We could have been so good together
   Solm7                          Lam7
We could have lived this dance forever
    La#maj7                      Lam7
But now who's gonna dance with me?

Please stay

                               Solm7                   Lam7
  I'm never gonna dance again, Guilty feet have got no rhythm,
La#maj7                           Lam7
 Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool

  So I'm never gonna dance again
    Lam7                 Rem  Solm7  Lam7 La#maj7  Lam7
The way I danced with you

Rem               Solm7                 La#maj7  Lam7
 (Now that you're gone) Now that you're gone
Rem               Solm7                        Lam7 La#maj7
 (Now that you're gone) Was what I did so wrong, so wrong
                Lam7
That you had to leave me alone

Rem   Solm7  Lam7 La#maj7   Lam7
