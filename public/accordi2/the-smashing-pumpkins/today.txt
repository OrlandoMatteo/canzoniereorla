  Today is the greatest
                 Re#
Day I've ever known
      La#        Sol#
Can't live for tomorrow,
                      Re#
Tomorrow's much too long
     La#     Sol#
I'll burn my eyes out
Re#  La#    Do
   Before I get out

Fa   Sol#   Dom
 I wanted more
Fa    Sol#        Dom
 Than life could ever grant me
Fa     Sol#     Dom
 Bored by the chore
Fa   Sol#    Sol    Re5
  Of saving face

Can't wait for tomorrow

I might not have that long

I'll tear my heart out

   Before I get out

 Pink ribbon scars
     La#       Fa
That never forget
   Sol#     Re#
I tried so hard
   La#              Fa
To cleanse these regrets
   Sol#   Re#
My angel wings
     La#             Fa
Were bruised and restrained
   Sol#    Sol    Re5
My belly stings
Re# La#
  Today is
Re#  Sol#

The greatest day

Re#  La#  Do

Fa         Sol#      Do
 I want to turn you on
Fa         Sol#      Do
 I want to turn you on
Fa         Sol#      Do
 I want to turn you on
Fa         Sol#
 I want to turn you

 That I have ever really known
