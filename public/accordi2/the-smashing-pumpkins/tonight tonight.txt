Time is never time at all

You can never ever leave
  Do#7sus4          Re#m          Fa#  Simaj7
without leaving a piece of youth
        Do#7sus4            Simaj7
And our lives are forever changed

We will never be the same

 And you know you're never sure
                             Re#m
But you're sure you could be right

If you held yourself up to the light
Fa#
 And the embers never fade

In your city by the lake

The place where you were born

to offer up the night tonight

The indescribable moments of your life tonight
