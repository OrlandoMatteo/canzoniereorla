There was a time, I used to look into my father's eyes
             Sim                                 Sol
In a happy home, I was a king I had a gold throne
                  La            Sim                    Sol
Those days are gone, now the memories are on the wall
                La         Sim                     Sol        La
I hear the songs from the places where I was born


Sim                              La    Sol
  Up on the hill across the blue lake,
                               La      Sim
thats where I had my first heart break
                            La      Sol
I still remember how it all changed
    Re          La
my father said
          Sim                           Sol
Don't you worry, don't you worry child
                   Re           La
See heaven's got a plan for you
          Sim                        Sol
Don't you worry, don't you worry now
         La     Sim            Sol     Re  La
Yeah!          Ooh ooh ooh ooooh!
          Sim                      Sol

            Sim                                   Sol
There was a time, I met a girl of a different kind
                 Sim
We ruled the world,
                                         Sol                   La
I thought I'll never lose her out of sight,   we were so young
  Sim                       Sol
I think of her now and then
                La      Sim                   Sol     La
Still hear the songs reminding me of a friend


Sim                              La    Sol
  Up on the hill across the blue lake,
                               La      Sim
thats where I had my first heart break
