Solm
Sweet little words made for silence not talk
Re#                      Fa
Young heart for love not heartache
Solm             La#
Dark hair for catching the wind

Not to veil the sight of a cold world

Kiss while your lips are still red
           Dom
While he's still silent
Solm       Rem              Re#        Fa
Rest while bosom is still untouched, unveiled

             Solm           Rem                    Fa
Hold another hand while the hand's still without a tool
           Dom                Fa    Solm
Drown into eyes while they're still blind
Rem                        Re#                 Fa
Love while the night still hides the withering dawn

The violin, the poet's hand
