Re#m                     Do#
Finally the hills are without eyes
     Re#m         Fa#        Do#
They are tired of painting a dead man's face red
     La#m      Si
With their own blood
Re#m              Do#       Re#m
They used to love having so much to lose
Fa#        Do#                    Si                 Re#m
Blink your eyes just once and see everything in ruins

 Did you ever hear what I told you
                                   Re#m
Did you ever read what I wrote you
                               Do#/Fa
Did you ever listen to what we played

Did you ever let in what the world said
Re#m                                   Si/Re#
 Did we get this far just to feel your hate
                                        La#m
Did we play to become only pawns in the game

How blind can you be, don't you see
    Do#
You chose the long road but we'll be waiting
Re#5
Bye bye beautiful...

Jacob's ghost for the girl in white
          Fa#     Do#
Blindfold for the blind
                      La#m      Si
Dead siblings walking the dying earth
Re#m           Do#     Re#m
Noose around a choking heart
 Fa#     Do#
Eternity torn apart
                  Si
Slow toll now the funeral bells
Re#m
 “I need to die to feel alive”

 It's not the tree that forsakes the flower

But the flower that forsakes the tree

Someday I'll learn to love these scars

Still fresh from the red-hot blade of your words
