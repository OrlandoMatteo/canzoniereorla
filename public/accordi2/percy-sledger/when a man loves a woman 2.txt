       Do#         Sol#/Do   La#m
When a man loves a woman,
               Do#/Sol#              Fa#
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else,
                Sol#                        Do#      Sol#7
He'd change the world for the good thing he's found
          Do#           Sol#/Do   La#m
If she is bad, he can't see it,
             Do#/Sol#  Fa#
She can do no wrong,
                     Sol#                   Do#      Sol#7
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down
       Do#         Sol#/Do   La#m
When a man loves a woman,
            Do#/Sol#           Fa#
He'll spend his very last dime
            Sol#           Do#      Sol#7
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
             Do#     Sol#/Do    La#m
He'd give up all his comforts
                     Do#/Sol#  Fa#
And sleep out in the rain,
                  Sol#
If she said that's the way
    Do#         Do#7
It ought to be

Fa#               Do#            Fa#
 Well, this man loves you, woman
                      Do#     Fa#
I gave you everything I have,
                     Do#       La#m
Tryin' to hold on to your heartless love
Re#7                        Sol#7
Baby, please don't treat me bad

       Do#         Sol#/Do   La#m
When a man loves a woman,
             Do#/Sol#    Fa#
Down deep in his soul,
          Sol#          Do#    Sol#7
She can bring him such misery
          Do#          Sol#/Do     La#m
If she is playin' him for a fool,
              Do#/Sol#      Fa#
He's the last one to know
          Sol#     Do#      Sol#7
Lovin' eyes can never see
       Do#         Sol#/Do   La#m
When a man loves a woman
              Do#/Sol#   Fa#
He can do her no wrong,
             Sol#
He can never want
           Do#   Sol#7
Some other girl
            Do#         Sol#/Do  La#m
Yes, When a man loves a woman
             Do#/Sol#         Fa#
I know exactly how he feels,
             Sol#           Do#      Sol#7
'Cause baby, baby, you're my world
       Do#         Sol#/Do   La#m  Do#/Sol#
When a man loves a woman....
