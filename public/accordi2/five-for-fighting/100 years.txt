Sol   Do
 I'm 15 for a moment
Lam7          Re7
 Caught in between 10 and 20
    Sol/Si            Mim
And I'm just dreaming
             Lam7              Re7
Counting the ways to where you are
Sol   Do
 I'm 22 for a moment
Lam7            Re7
 And she feels better than ever
    Sol/Si       Mim7
And we're on fire
           Lam7          Re7
Making our way back from Mars

Sol   Re          Do        Sol
 15 there's still time for you
        Re      Do      Sol
Time to buy and time to lose
 Re        Do      Mim7 Re          Doadd9
15 there's never a wish better than this
                                     Sol/Si Do  Mim7 Re
When you only got a hundred years to live

Sol/Si Do  Mim7 Re

Sol   Do
 I'm 33 for a moment
Lam7          Re7                      Sol/Si
 I'm still the man, but you see I'm a "they"
             Mim7
A kid on the way, babe
  Lam7         Re7
A family on my mind
Sol   Doadd9
 I'm 45 for a moment
Lam7        Re7
 The sea is high
                  Sol/Si   Mim7
And I'm heading into a crisis
            Lam7        Re7
Chasing the years of my life

Sol  Re           Do       Sol
 15 there's still time for you
        Re      Do      Mim7
Time to buy and time to lose yourself
  Re             Do
Within a morning star
Sol  Re     Do         Sol
 15 I'm all right with you
  Re               Mim7 Sol         Do
15 there's never a wish better than this

When you only got a hundred years to live
               Re
Half time goes by
                Mim7
Suddenly you’re wise
                    Famaj7
Another blink of an eye
      Do
67 is gone
                   Re
The sun is getting high
             Sol  Do  Lam7  Re7
We're moving on

Sol   Do
 I'm 99 for a moment
Lam7           Doadd9
 And dying for just another moment
    Sol/Si        Mim
And I'm just dreaming
             Lam7              Re7
Counting the ways to where you are

Sol  Re           Do         Sol
 15 there's still time for you
 Re  Do       Sol
22 I feel her too
 Re       Do      Sol
33 you’re on your way
      Re      Do
Every day's a new day

Time to buy and time to choose

When you only got a hundred years to live
