Do                 Sol
I can't stand to fly

I'm not that naive
Do                Sol
I'm just out to find

The better part of me

I'm more than a bird, I'm more than a plane
                  Lam               Fa
I'm more than some  pretty face beside a train

It's not easy to be me


  Do                  Sol
I wish that I could cry

 Fall upon my knees
Do              Sol
Find a way to lie
         Lam                Fa
'Bout a home I'll never see

It may sound absurd but don't be naive

Even heroes have the right to bleed
             Do                        Sol
I may be disturbed but won't you concede
      Lam             Fa
Even heroes have the right to dream

And it's not easy to be me


Lam     Sol/Si    Do    Rem       Lam
Up, up and away, away from me

Well, it's alright
        Do                 Re
You can all sleep sound tonight

With clouds between their knees


           Do                  Sol
I'm only a man in a silly red sheet
           Lam                   Fa
Digging for kryptonite on this one-way street

Only a man in a funny red sheet
