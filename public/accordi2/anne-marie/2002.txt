I will always remember
     Re
The day you kissed my lips
   La         Sim
Light as a feather
        Sim
And it went just like this
     Fa#m            Sol
No, it's never been better
              La        Re
Than the summer of 2002

We were only eleven

But acting like grownups
      La            Sim
Like we are in the present
        Sim
Drinking from plastic cups
         Fa#m     Sol            La
Singing love is forever and ever
                       Re
Well, I guess that was true

Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
       Re            La
Of an old Mustang, where we sang
  Sol                            La
Songs with all our childhood friends

And it went like this, say


 Sol      Re      La                        Sim
Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
          Sol                          Re
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
        La                      Sim
Better hit me, baby, one more time
  Sol                  Re
Paint a picture for you and me
         La                Sim
Of the days when we were young
   Sol                            La
Singing at the top of both our lungs


                      Re
Now we're under the covers
       Re
Fast forward to eighteen
         La         Sim
We are more than lovers
       Sim
Yeah, we are all we need
         Fa#m        Sol
When we're holding each other
            La         Re
I'm taken back to 2002

Yeah
