  Lam          Re7
   Oh here it comes
             Lam
  That funny feelin’ again
             Fa        Sol             Mi
  Winding me up inside every time we touch
               Rem
  Hey I don't know
               Lam
  Just tell me where to begin
           Fa         Sol      Mi
  ‘Cause I never ever felt so much
 La#                Fa
  No I can't recall   any love at all
 Re#                       Fa  Sol
  Baby this blows 'em all away

 Do                Lam7
  It's got what it takes
             Fa        Sol      Do
  So tell me why can't this be love
                    Lam7
  Straight from my heart
             Fa        Sol     Lam
  Oh tell me why can't this be love
            Re

  Hey only fools rush in
           Fa                   Sol                Mi
  And only time will tell if we stand the test of time
         Rem
  All I know
                Lam
  You've got to run to win
              Fa                 Sol             Mi
  And I'll be damned if I'll get hung up on the line
 La#               Fa
  No I can't recall  any love at all
 Re#                       Fa  Sol
  Baby this blows 'em all away

 Do                 Lam7
  It's got what it takes
             Fa        Sol      Do
  So tell me why can't this be love
                   Lam7
  Straight from my heart
