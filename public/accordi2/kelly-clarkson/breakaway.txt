Lam            Sol
 Grew up in a small town
Do                        Fa
 And when the rain would fall down
Lam        Sol            Fa 
 I'd just stare out my window
Lam                Sol 
 Dreaming of what could be
Do                  Fa 
 And if I'd end up happy
 Lam Sol     Fa
 I would pray 

Lam              Sol
 Trying hard to reach out
Do                    Fa 
 But when I tried to speak out
Lam         Sol            Fa 
 Felt like no one could hear me
Lam            Sol 
 Wanted to belong here
Do                      Fa 
 But something felt so wrong here
 Lam Sol    Fa 
 So I'd pray 
Lam       Sol       Re   Fa  Sol
 I could break away 


Do                             Sol  
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly.
     Lam                    Fa        
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky. 
Do
 Make a wish, take a chance, 
Sol                   Lam    Sol Fa
 Make a change, and break away. 
Do                       Sol
Out of the darkness and into the sun. 
    Lam                     Fa
But I won't forget all the ones that I love.
      Do 
 I'll take a risk, take a chance, 
Sol                   Lam    Sol Fa
 Make a change, and break away 


Lam         Sol      Do          Fa
Da da da n da da, Da da da n da da
Lam         Sol        Fa               
Da da da n da da da da


Lam              Sol
 Wanna feel the warm breeze 
Do              Fa
 Sleep under a palm tree
Lam        Sol           Fa
 Feel the rush of the ocean 
Lam             Sol
 Get onboard a fast train 
Do            Fa
 Travel on a jetplane
 Lam  Sol Fa 
 Far away 
     Lam    Sol Re   Fa  Sol
 And break away 


Do                             Sol
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly.
     Lam                    Fa 
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky. 
Do
 Make a wish, take a chance, 
Sol                   Lam    Sol Fa
 Make a change, and break away.
Do                       Sol 
Out of the darkness and into the sun. 
Lam                         Fa
But I won't forget all the ones that I love.
      Do 
 I'll take a risk, take a chance, 
Sol                   Lam    Sol Fa
 Make a change, and break away 


 Sol
 Buildings with a hundred floors 
Do                Fa
 Swinging with revolving doors 
Sol                                Do    Fa
 Maybe I don't know where they'll take me 
Sol                   Do       Fa
 Gotta keep movin on movin on
      Re 
 Fly away 
        Fa    Sol
 Break away 


Do                             Sol
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly.
Lam                      Fa 
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
Do 
 Take a risk, take a chance, 
Sol                   Lam    Sol Fa
 Make a change, and break away.
Do                       Sol 
Out of the darkness and into the sun.
Lam                     Fa 
But I won't forget the place I come from
         Do 
 I gotta take a risk, take a chance, 
Sol                   Lam    Sol Fa
 Make a change, and break away
 Lam    Sol Fa
 Break away
 Lam    Sol Fa
 Break away</pre>]
