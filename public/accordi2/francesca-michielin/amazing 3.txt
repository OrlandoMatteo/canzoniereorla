       Rem  Sol/Re  Rem/Fa

  Rem       Sol/Re
    Open my eyes
                Rem/Fa
    look at the pale sky
  Rem            Sol/Re
    all has gone white
              Rem/Fa
    can't even see
  Rem          Sol/Re
    the hidden sun
                   Rem/Fa
    the clouds are winning
  Rem            Sol/Re
    everything's still
                 Rem/Fa
    just you and me
                 Solm                Rem
    And when our hopes are about to fall
             Do                  Sol
    we can restart and shine as gold
                  Rem               Do
    and when our dreams seem to be gone
                  Sol
    crashing the dusk into our dawn

  Solm
    Gain love from the pain
  Rem
    Gain life from the rain
  Do            Sol
    a new rainbow for you
  Rem
    there will come a day
  Do
    we'll find our place
  Sol                Rem
    isn't it so amazing?

               Sol/Re        Rem/Fa
    Over the clouds always a gold sun
  Rem            Sol/Re           Rem/Fa
    it will come out, and light you up
  Rem        Sol/Re                 Rem/Fa
    After tonight the fight will be over
  Rem                 Sol/Re            Rem/Fa
    The weight of the world won't be on me
                 Solm7                Rem
    And when our hopes are about to fall
              Do                 Sol
    we can restart and shine as gold
                 Rem                 Do

    isn't it so amazing?

           Do                    Lam7   La#
    I will follow you trough the ocean
            Do                 Lam7     La#maj7
    I will leave behind all my consciences
