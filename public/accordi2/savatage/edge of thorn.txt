               Do/Re  Sol Rem
An offering of reasons
                   Do/Re  Sol Rem
We put them all in play
              Do/Re   Sol
A covering of treasons
     Rem                     Do/Re  Sol Solm
That one by one we let slip away
           Rem     Solm
A solitary dancer
                 Rem    La#
So lost upon her stage
       Do              Rem  Do La#
I have seen you on the edge of dawn
         Do           Rem Do   La#
Felt you there before you were born
              Do              Rem  Do La#
Balanced your dreams upon the edge of thorns
                               Rem   Do/Re  Sol
But I don't think about you anymore

Rem    Do/Re  Sol La#   Fa Do/Mi

Rem                Do/Re   Sol Rem
 A study made from winter
                 Do/Re   Sol Rem
Of summers long ago
                        Do/Re   Sol
And dreams that used to glitter
Rem                     Do/Re   Sol Solm
Safely now hidden under snow
                  Rem     Solm
And so we end the chapter
                     Rem       La#
And let the stage lights fade
       Do              Rem  Do La#
I have seen you on the edge of dawn
         Do           Rem Do   La#
Felt you there before you were born
              Do              Rem  Do La#
Balanced your dreams upon the edge of thorns
                                 Rem
But I don't think about you anymore
