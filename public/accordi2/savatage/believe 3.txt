   Do              Sol
So after all these one night stands
       La#           Fa
You've ended up with heart in hand
  Do          Sol              Fa
A child alone on your own, retreating
  Do              Sol
Regretful for the things you're not
    La#                Fa
And all the dreams you haven't got
  Do              Sol                  Fa
Without a home, a heart of stone, lies bleeding
        Sol
And for all the roads you followed
        Fa
And for all you did not find
        Sol                               Fa
And for all the dreams you had to leave behind...

Do         Sol           Lam
  I am the way, I am the light
         Fa     Sol      Do
I am the dark inside the night
            Sol                Lam
I hear your hopes, I feel your dreams
           Fa     Sol       Do
And in the dark I hear your screams
            Sol               Lam
Don't turn away, just take my hand
             Fa        Sol   Do
And when you make your final stand
              Sol                 Lam
I'll be right there, I'll never leave
      Fa     Sol       Do    Fa/Do  Do  Fa/Do
All I ask of you is believe

     Do                  Sol
Your childhood eyes were so intense
      La#            Fa
While bartering your innocence
     Do                 Sol                Fa
For bits of string, the grown-up wings you needed
    Do              Sol
And when you had to add them up
    La#                  Fa
You found that they were not enough
   Do         Sol            Fa
To get you in pay for sins repeated

        Sol
And for all the years you borrowed
        Fa
And for all the tears you cried
        Sol                             Fa
And for all the fears you had to keep inside...

Do         Sol           Lam
  I am the way, I am the light
         Fa     Sol      Do
I am the dark inside the night
            Sol                Lam
I hear your hopes, I feel your dreams
           Fa     Sol       Do
And in the dark I hear your screams
            Sol               Lam
Don't turn away, just take my hand
             Fa        Sol   Do
And when you make your final stand
              Sol                 Lam
I'll be right there, I'll never leave
      Fa     Sol       Do    Sol  Lam  Fa Sol
All I ask of you is believe

        Do                    Sol
I never wanted to know, never wanted to see
  Lam                 Fa          Sol
I wasted my time till time wasted me
        Do                   Sol
I never wanted to go, always wanted to stay
           Lam                  Fa           Sol
'Cause the persons I am are the parts that I play
     Do                     Sol
So I plot and I plan, and I hope and I scheme
       Lam                         Fa         Sol
To the lure of a night filled with unfinished dreams
        Do                    Sol
And I'm holding on tight to a world gone astray
        Lam                Fa  Sol            Do  Sol  Lam  Fa Sol
As they charge me for years   I can no longer pay

Do  Sol  Lam  Fa Sol   Do  Sol  Lam  Fa Sol

Do  Sol  Lam  Fa Sol   Do  Sol  Lam  Fa Sol


Do         Sol           Lam
  I am the way, I am the light
         Fa     Sol      Do
I am the dark inside the night
            Sol                Lam
I hear your hopes, I feel your dreams
           Fa     Sol       Do
And in the dark I hear your screams
            Sol               Lam
Don't turn away, just take my hand
             Fa        Sol   Do
And when you make your final stand
              Sol                 Lam
I'll be right there, I'll never leave
      Fa     Sol       Do    Fa/Do  Do  Fa/Do
All I ask of you is believe

Do  Fa/Do  Do
   ......Believe
