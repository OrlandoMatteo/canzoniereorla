       Mi   La Mi    La Mi

         Mi
I walked forty-seven miles of barbed wire,

I got a cobra snake for a necktie

A brand new house on the road side,

and it's a-made out of rattlesnake hide

Got a band new chimney put on top,

and it's a-made out of human skull

Come on take a little walk with me baby,
                              Mi   La Mi
and tell me who do you love?
                 Mi    La Mi
Who do you love?

Around the town I use a rattlesnake whip,

take it easy baby don't you give me no lip
               La Mi    La Mi
Who do you love?
               La Mi    La Mi
Who do you love?

I've got a tombstone hand and a graveyard mind,

I'm just twenty-two and I don't mind dying
                Mi    La Mi
Who do you love?
                Mi    La Mi
Who do you love?
                Mi    La Mi
Who do you love?

Mi    La Mi    Mi  Re  Mi

Mi    La Mi    Mi  Re  Mi

Mi    La Mi    Mi    La Mi

Now Arlene took a-me by my hand,

she said "Lonesome George you don't understand,
               La Mi    La Mi
who do you love?"

The night were dark and the sky were blue,
                            La  Mi
down the alleyway a house wagon flew

Hit a bump and somebody screamed,

you should've heard what I'd seen
                Mi7
Who do you love?
                Mi    La Mi
Who do you love?
                Mi    La Mi
Who do you love?
                Mi    La Mi
Who do you love?

Mi7           Mi    La Mi    La Mi

Mi    La Mi    Mi  Re  Mi

Mi    La Mi    Mi  Re  Mi

Mi    La Mi

                                                  Mi    La Mi
Yeah, I've got a tombstone hand in a graveyard mine,
                                      Mi    La Mi
just twenty-two baby I don't mind dying
                                          Mi    La Mi
Snake skin shoes baby put them on your feet,
                                             Mi    La Mi
got the goodtime music and the Bo Diddley beat
                Mi    La Mi
Who do you love?
                Mi    La Mi
Who do you love?

I walked forty-seven miles of barbed wire,

I got a cobra snake for a necktie
                         La   Mi
A brand new house on the road side,

and it's made out of rattlesnake hide

Got a band new chimney put on top,

and it's made out of human skull

Come on take a little walk with me child,
                     La Mi   Mi    La Mi
tell me who do you love?
                Mi    La Mi
Who do you love?
             La Mi    La Mi
Who do you love?

Mi    La Mi    Mi    La Mi
