[<pre>Do
When tomorrow comes
Do
I'll be on my own
Sol
Feeling frightened of
                         Do
The things that I don't know
Do
When tomorrow comes, tomorrow comes
Fa
Tomorrow comes

Do
And though the road is long
Do
I look up to the sky
Sol
And in the dark I found, lost hope that I won't fly
Do                                      Fa
And I sing along, I sing along, and I sing along


Do
I got all I need when I got you and I
Sol
I look around me, and see sweet life
Lam
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
Fa
You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
Do                                            Sol
Can´t stop my heart when you shinin' in my eyes
Sol                        Lam
Can't lie, it's a sweet life
Lam                                           Fa

You're gettin' me, gettin' me through the night
                        Sol
Cause you're my flash light
                  Lam                     Fa
You're my flash light, you're my flash light


Do
I see the shadows long beneath the mountain top
Sol
I'm not the afraid when the rain won't stop
Do
Cause you light the way
                   Fa
You light the way, you light the way


Do
I got all I need when I got you and I

I look around me, and see sweet life
