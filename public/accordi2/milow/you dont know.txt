Lam         Fa                            Sol
sometimes everything seems awkward and large
Lam                              Fa
imagine a Wednesday evening in March
           Sol           Do    Mi
future and past at the same time
Lam                Fa                            Sol
I make use of the night, start drinking a lot
             Lam                             Fa   Sol
although not ideal for now it's all that I've got
              Do         Mi
it's nice to know your name


Lam             Fa                Sol
you don't know you don't know
               Lam             Fa   Mi
you don't know anything about me


Lam         Fa                      Sol
an ocean a lake I need a place to drown
                 Lam                      Fa     Sol
let's freeze the moment because we're going down
         Do          Mi
tomorrow you'll be gone
Lam                  Fa                   Sol
you're laughing too hard this all seems surreal
       Lam                       Fa
I feel peculiar now what do you feel
                       Sol                Mi7     Mi
do you think there's a chance that we can fall


Lam             Fa               Sol
you don't know you don't know
               Lam              Fa
you don't know anything about me
        Sol                  Do      Mi

Lam             Fa               Sol
you don't know you don't know
Lam                            Fa   Sol
you don't know anything about me

Fa          Sol              Do
I gave up dreaming for a while
Fa          Sol              Do
I gave up dreaming for a while


Lam                 Fa               Sol
I've noticed these are mysterious days
             Lam                        Fa
I look at it like a jigsaw puzzle and gaze
               Sol                 Do     Mi
with wide open mouth and burning eyes
Lam       Fa               Sol
if only I could start to care
Lam                                     Fa      Sol
my dreams and my Wednesdays ain't going nowhere
