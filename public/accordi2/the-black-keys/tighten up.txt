       Fa#m  Lamaj7  Sim  Do#7

  Fa#m           Lamaj7
I wanted love, I needed love
  Sim         Do#7
Most of all, most of all
Fa#m              Lamaj7
Someone said true love was dead
        Sim             Do#7
And I'm bound to fall, bound to fall
    Fa#m   Lamaj7
For you
               Sim
Oh, what can I do?
     Do#7
Yeah
Fa#m                 Lamaj7
Take my badge but my heart remains
  Sim        Do#7
Lovin' you, baby child
Fa#m        Lamaj7
Tighten up on your reins
        Sim           Do#7
You're runnin' wild, runnin' wild
     Fa#m
It's true

Fa#m       La  Si

Fa#m       La  Si

Fa#m              Lamaj7
 Sick for days in so many ways
    Sim              Do#7
I'm achin' now, I'm achin' now
     Fa#m               Lamaj7
It's times like these I need relief
       Sim             Do#7
Please show me how, oh show me how
        Fa#m    Lamaj7
To get right
              Sim        Do#7
Yeah, it's out of sight
     Fa#m            Lamaj7
When I was young and moving fast
            Sim
Nothing slowed me down
   Do#7
Oh slowed me down
Fa#m          Lamaj7
Now I let the others pass
     Sim
I've come around
   Do#7
Oh come around
            Fa#m
'Cause I've found

Fa#m     La  Si

Fa#m     La  Si

Fa#m  Do#m  Fa#m  Do#m  Fa#m  Do#m  La  Si

Fa#m           Do#m
Living just to keep going
Fa#m          Do#m
Going just to be sane
Fa#m          Do#m
All the while not knowing
La    Si
 It's such a shame
Fa#m            Do#m
I don't need to get steady
  Fa#m        Do#m
I know just how I feel
    Fa#m             Do#m
I'm telling you to be ready
La    Si
   My dear
