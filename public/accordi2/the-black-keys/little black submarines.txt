Lam          Sol
Little black submarines
Re      La
Operator please
Lam         Sol       La
Put me back on the line
Lam           Sol
Told my girl I'd be back
Re      La
Operator please
Lam       Sol          La
This is wrecking my mind


Lam         Sol
Oh, can it be
    Re              La
The voices calling me
La - Si - Do         Re      La
They get lost and out of time
  Lam                Sol
I should've seen it glow
    Re         La
But everybody knows
       Do      Re        La
That a broken heart is blind
La - Si - Do     Re        La
That a broken heart is blind


Lam          Sol
Pick you up, let you down
Re      La
When I wanna go
Lam         Sol       La
To a place I can hide
Lam           Sol
You know me, I had plans
Re      La
But they just disappeared
Lam       Sol          La
To the back of my mind


Lam         Sol
Oh, can it be
    Re              La
The voices calling me
La - Si - Do         Re      La
They get lost and out of time
  Lam                Sol
I should've seen it glow
    Re         La
But everybody knows
       Do      Re        La
That a broken heart is blind
La - Si - Do     Re        La
That a broken heart is blind


Lam          Sol
Treasure maps, fallen trees
Re      La
Operator please
Lam         Sol       La    
Call me back when it's time
Lam           Sol
Stolen friends and disease
Re      La
Operator please
Lam         Sol       La
Pass me back to my mind


Lam         Sol
Oh, can it be
    Re              La
The voices calling me
La - Si - Do         Re      La
They get lost and out of time
  Lam                Sol
I should've seen it glow
    Re         La
But everybody knows
       Do      Re        La
That a broken heart is blind
La - Si - Do     Re        La
That a broken heart is blind
La - Si - Do     Re        La
That a broken heart is blind</pre>]
