Sol                  Fa
 Some folks are born made to wave the flag
Do                            Sol
 Ooh, they're red, white and blue
                         Fa
And when the band plays "Hail to the chief"
Do                             Sol
 Ooh, they point the cannon at you, Lord
            Re          Do                      Sol

           Re           Do                     Sol
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, no

Sol                   Fa
 Some folks are born silver spoon in hand
Do                         Sol
 Lord, don't they help themselves, oh
                     Fa
But when the taxman comes to the door
Do                                 Sol
 Lord, the house looks like a rummage sale, yes
            Re          Do                      Sol
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no senator's son, son
           Re           Do                     Sol
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, no

Some folks inherit star spangled eyes
Do                           Sol
 Ooh, they send you down to war, Lord
                         Fa
And when you ask them, "How much should we give?"
Do                      Sol
 Ooh, they only answer more! more! more! Yo
            Re          Do                      Sol
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no senator's son, son
           Re           Do                     Sol
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, no

           Re           Do                      Sol
