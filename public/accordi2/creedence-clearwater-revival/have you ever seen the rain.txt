Do
Someone told me long ago
Do                                   Sol
There's a calm before the storm, I know
                   Do
It's been coming for some time

Do
When it's over, so they say
Do                          Sol
It'll rain a sunny day, I know
                   Do
Shining down like water


Fa         Sol
I wanna know
         Do    Do/Si      Lam    Lam/Sol
Have you ever seen the rain
Fa         Sol
I wanna know
         Do    Do/Si      Lam    Lam/Sol
Have you ever seen the rain
Fa        Sol               Do
Coming down on a sunny day


Do
Yesterday and days before
Do                                Sol
Sun is cold and rain is hard, I know
                    Do
Been that way for all my time

Do
'Til forever on it goes
Do                                    Sol
Through the circle fast and slow, I know
                       Do
And it can't stop, I wonder


Fa         Sol
I wanna know
         Do    Do/Si      Lam    Lam/Sol
Have you ever seen the rain
Fa         Sol
I wanna know
         Do    Do/Si      Lam    Lam/Sol
Have you ever seen the rain
Fa        Sol                Do
Coming down on a sunny day


Fa         Sol
I wanna know
         Do    Do/Si      Lam    Lam/Sol
Have you ever seen the rain
Fa         Sol
I wanna know
         Do    Do/Si      Lam    Lam/Sol
Have you ever seen the rain
Fa        Sol                Do     Sol    Do
Coming down on a sunny day</pre>]
