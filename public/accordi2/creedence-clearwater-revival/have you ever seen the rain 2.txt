        Lam  Fa  Do  Sol  Do

Do
 Someone told me long ago There's a calm before the storm,
  Sol                    Do
I know It's been comin' for some time

When it's over, so they say, It'll rain a sunny day,
  Sol                    Do
I know Shinin' down like water

Fa         Sol            Do   Sol/Si   Lam   Lam/Sol
 I want to know, Have you ever seen the rain
Fa         Sol            Do   Sol/Si   Lam   Lam/Sol
 I want to know, Have you ever seen the rain
Fa       Sol            Do
 Comin' down on a sunny day?

Do
 Yesterday, and days before, Sun is cold and rain is hard,
  Sol                    Do
I know Been that way for all my time

'Til forever, on it goes Through the circle, fast and slow,
  Sol                   Do
I know It can't stop, I wonder

Fa         Sol            Do   Sol/Si   Lam   Lam/Sol
 I want to know, Have you ever seen the rain
Fa         Sol            Do   Sol/Si   Lam   Lam/Sol
 I want to know, Have you ever seen the rain
Fa       Sol            Do
 Comin' down on a sunny day?

Fa         Sol            Do   Sol/Si   Lam   Lam/Sol
 I want to know, Have you ever seen the rain
Fa         Sol            Do   Sol/Si   Lam   Lam/Sol
 I want to know, Have you ever seen the rain
Fa       Sol            Do    Sol  Do
 Comin' down on a sunny day?
