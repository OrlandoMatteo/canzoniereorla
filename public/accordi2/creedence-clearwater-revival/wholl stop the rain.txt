       Sol   Re/Fa# Mim    Re Sol

Sol                         Do          Sol
Long as I remember The rain been comin' down
                             Do            Sol
Clouds of myst'ry pourin' Confusion on the ground
Do                   Sol   Do                 Sol
Good men through the ages, Tryin' to find the sun
Do            Re              Mim             Sol
And I wonder, Still I wonder, Who'll stop the rain

Sol                            Do               Sol
 I went down Virginia, Seekin' shelter from the storm
                 Sim      Do                Sol
Caught up in the fable, I watched the tower grow
Do                  Sol        Do                Sol
Five year plans and new deals, Wrapped in golden chains
Do            Re             Mim             Sol
And I wonder, Still I wonder Who'll stop the rain

Do Sol Re     Lam Do Mim     Re Sol

Sol                        Do                 Sol
Heard the singers playin', How we cheered for more
                       Sim     Do             Sol
The crowd had rushed together, Tryin' to keep warm
Do                  Sol      Do            Sol
Still the rain kept pourin', Fallin' on my ears
Do            Re             Mim
And I wonder, Still I wonder Who'll stop the rain
