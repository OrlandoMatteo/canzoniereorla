Re
Left a good job in the city, workin' for the man every night and day

And I never lost one minute of sleepin', worryin' 'bout the way things might have been

Re
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis, pumped a lot of pane down in New Orleans

But I never saw the good side of the city, 'til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen
