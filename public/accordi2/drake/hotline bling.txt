Got a reputation for yourself now

Started wearing less and goin' out more

Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor

Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You and me we just don't get along

Running out of pages in your passport

These days, all I do is
Do                             Lam
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Do                             Lam
Wonder if you rolling up a backwoods for someone else
Do                                   Lam
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else
Mim
You don't need no one else
Mim                           Do
You don't need nobody else, no
                Lam
Why you never alone
                        Do
Why you always touching road
                        Lam
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
                Mim
You was in the zone
                   Mim
You should just be yourself
                           Mim
Right now, you're someone else
