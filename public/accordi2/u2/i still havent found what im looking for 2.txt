[<pre>       Do
I have climbed highest mountains

I have run through the fields
        Fasus2                Do
only to be with you, only to be with you
      Do
I have run, I have crawled
                                           Fasus2
I have scaled these city walls, these city walls
        Do
only to be with you


Sol             Fasus2          Do
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
Sol             Fasus2          Do
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for


   Do
I have kissed honey lips

Felt the healing in her fingertips
               Fasus2                Do
It burned like fire, this burning desire
       Do
I have spoke with the tongue of angels

I have held the hand of the devil
                   Fasus2                  Do
It was warm in the night, I was cold as a stone


      Sol             Fasus2          Do
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
      Sol             Fasus2          Do
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for




 Do     Do4 Do     Do4 Do     Do4 Do     Do4
 Do     Do4 Do          
 Fa           Fa          
 Do     Do4 Do          


Do
I believe in the kingdom come

then all the colours they will
                           Fasus2
bleed into one, bleed into one
                  Do
But yes I'm still running
                      Do
You broke the bonds and you loosed the chains
                                         Fasus2
carried the cross of, of my shame, of my shame
             Do
You know I believe it


      Sol             Fasus2          Do
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
      Sol             Fasus2          Do
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
      Sol             Fasus2          Do
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
      Sol             Fasus2          Do
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
