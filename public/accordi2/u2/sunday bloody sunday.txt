[<pre>Yes... 
Sim           Re                Sol6 
  I can't believe the news today 
Sim              Re 
  Oh, I can't close my eyes 
     Sol6 
And make it go away 
Re 
 How long... 
 Mim 
How long must we sing this song? 
Re               Mim 
 How long? How long... 
           Sim  Re   Sol6 
'cause tonight....we can be as one 
   Sim   Re   Sol6 
Tonight... 

Sim         Re              Sol6 
   Broken bottles under children's feet 
Sim          Re               Sol6 
  Bodies strewn across the dead end street 
Sim              Re              Sol6 
  But I won't heed the battle call 
Sim            Re 
  It puts my back up 
         Sol6 
Puts my back up against the wall 

[Chorus]
Sim      Re         Sol6 
  Sunday, Bloody Sunday 
Sim      Re         Sol6 
  Sunday, Bloody Sunday 
Fa    Mim          Re 
 Sunday, Bloody Sunday 
Fa    Mim          Re 
..uh let's go.. 

Sim  Re  Sol6 
Sim  Re  Sol6 

Sim         Re               Sol6 
  And the battle's just begun 
Sim              Re                 Sol6 
  There's many lost, but tell me who has won 
Sim               Re              Sol6 
  The trench is dug within our hearts 
Sim               Re                  Sol6 
  And mothers, children, brothers, sisters 
Torn apart 

Sim    Re           Sol6 
  Sunday, Bloody Sunday 
Sim    Re           Sol6 
  Sunday, Bloody Sunday

Sim  Re  Sol6 
Sim  Re  Sol6 

Sim           Re            Sol6 
  And it's true we are immune 
Sim               Re          Sol6 
  When fact is fiction and TV reality 
Sim       Re                 Sol6 
  And today the millions cry 
Sim             Re           Sol6 
  We eat and drink while tomorrow they die 
(Sunday, Bloody Sunday) 
Sim          Re           Sol6 
  The real battle just begun 
Sim              Re             Sol6 
  To claim the victory Jesus won 
On... 


Sim    Re           Sol6

Sim    Re           Sol6 
  Sunday, Bloody Sunday
