Rem
Future needs a big kiss

Winds blow with a twist

Never seen a move like this

Can you see it too

Night is falling everywhere

Rockets hit the funfair

Satan loves a bomb scare

But it won't scare you

Hey...Sexy Boots

Get on your Boots

Yeah...

Rem
Free me from the dark dream

Candy bars, ice cream

All the kids are screaming but the ghosts arent real

Heres what you gotta be

Love and community

Laughter is eternity if the joy is real

If someones into blowing up

Women are the future

All the big revelations

Youve got gasoline

I dont wanna talk about wars between nations

Not right now   Sexy Boots
