The heart is a bloom           Shoots up through the stony ground

There's no room          No space to rent in this town

You thought you'd found a friend      To take you out of this place
        La  Sim    Re   Sol          Re       La
Someone you could lend a hand   In return for grace

You're on the road         But you've got no destination

You love this town             Even if that doesn't ring true

 See the world in green and blue   See China right in front of you
Mim              Sol             Re
 See the canyons broken by cloud   See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
Mim              Sol             Re
 See the Bedouin fires at night    See the oil fields at first light and
Mim                  Sol              Re                        La
