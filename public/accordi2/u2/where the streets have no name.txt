Re  Sol  Re  Sol  Sim  La  Doadd9

          Re
I want to run, I want to hide
                                           Sol
I want to tear down the walls that hold me inside
              Sim
I want to reach out
               La
And touch the flame
          Doadd9
Where the streets have no name
          Re
I want to feel, sunlight on my face
                                       Sol
See that dust cloud disappear without a trace
               Sim7                    La
I want to take shelter from the poison rain
          Doadd9
Where the streets have no name

Where the streets have no name

Where the streets have no name
                          Sol
We're still building then burning down love Burning down love
          Sim7                  La
And when I go there, I go there with you
             Re
It's all I can do

             Re
The city's a flood

And our love turns to rust
                                             Sol
We're beaten and blown by the wind, trampled in dust
               Sim7               La
I'll show you a place high on the desert plain
          Doadd9
Where the streets have no name

Our love turns to rust
                     Sol
And we're beaten and blown by the wind
                            Re
Blown by the wind, oh and I see love see our love turn to rust
                     Sol
And we're beaten and blown by the wind
                           Sim7
Blown by the wind, oh when I go there
           La                   Re      Sol   Re   Sol
I go there with you, it's all I can do
