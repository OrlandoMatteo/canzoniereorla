Fa#m  Do#m  La  Mi    Si
                   Magnificent
Fa#m  Do#m  La  Mi         Si
                Oh, oh, magnificent

Fa#m    Do#m  La    Mi       Si          Sim
  I was born,  I was born to be with you
                  Fa#m        Do#m  La        Mi              Si         Sim
In this space and time, after that,  and ever after I haven't had a clue
              Fa#m               Do#m  La           Mi    Si             Sim
Only to break rhyme, this foolishness,  can leave a heart black and blue

Oh, oh

Fa#m   Do#m   La     Mi      Si                Sim
  Only love,   only love can leave such a mark
Fa#m       Do#m   La     Mi      Si               Sim
  But only love,   only love can heal such a scar

Fa#m    Do#m  La     Mi      Si            Sim
  I was born,  I was born to sing for you
                Fa#m               Do#m
I didnâ€™t have a choice but to lift you up,
La           Mi             Si             Sim
 and sing whatever song you wanted me to
                   Fa#m            Do#m
I give you back my voice, from the womb,
La            Mi              Si     Sim
my first cry, it was a joyful noise    ...Oh, oh

Fa#m   Do#m   La     Mi      Si                Sim
  Only love,   only love can leave such a mark
Fa#m       Do#m   La     Mi      Si               Sim
  But only love,   only love can heal such a scar
Fa#m   Do#m
  Justified till we die, you and
La              Mi          Si        Re
I will magnify, oh-oh-oh, magnificent
   La        Do#m   Fa#
Magnificent, oh

Fa#m  Do#m  La  Mi  Si  Sim

Fa#m   Do#m   La     Mi      Si                Sim
  Only love,   only love can leave such a mark
Fa#m       Do#m   La     Mi      Si               Sim
  But only love,   only love can heal such a scar
Fa#m   Do#m
  Justified till we die, you and
La              Mi          Si        Sim
I will magnify, oh-oh-oh, magnificent
               Fa#m
Magnificent, oh
