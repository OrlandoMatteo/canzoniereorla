Lights go down, it's dark The jungle is your head,
Can't rule your heart a feeling's so much stronger than a thought
your eyes are wide and though your soul, it can't be bought
your mind can wander

Mim        Re
  Hello hello (Hola!)
Sol                     La
  I'm at a place called Vertigo (Donde esta)
Mim                        Re
  It's everything I wish I didn't know
       Sol         Re              Mim
Except you give me something I can feel, feel

    Mim
The night is full of holes As bullets rip the sky
Of ink with gold They twinkle as the Boys play rock and roll
They know they can't dance At least they know....
Mim
I can't stand the beat I'm asking for the cheque
The girl with crimson nails Has Jesus round her neck
Swinging to the music Swinging to the music.. Oh oh oh oh
