You say you'll give me a highway with no one on it
  Sol                      Doadd9
A treasure just to look upon it

All the riches in the night

You say you'll give me eyes in a moon of blindness
  Sol                  Doadd9
A river in a time of dryness
  Sol              Doadd9
A harbour in the tempest

                         
          Mim          Doadd9
