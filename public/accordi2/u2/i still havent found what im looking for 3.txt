       Do#
I have climbed the highest mountains

I have run through the fields
        Fa#
Only to be with you
           Do#
Only to be with you

I have run I have crawled
                  Fa#
I have scaled these city walls
           Do#
Only to be with you
      Sol#             Fa#
But I still haven't found
            Do#
What I'm looking for
      Sol#             Fa#
But I still haven't found
            Do#
What I'm looking for

       Do#
I have kissed honey lips

Felt the healing in her fingertips
            Fa#
It burned like fire
            Do#
This burning desire

I have spoke with the tongue of angels

I have held the hand of a devil
               Fa#
It was warm in the night
               Do#
I was cold as a stone
      Sol#             Fa#
But I still haven't found
            Do#
What I'm looking for
      Sol#             Fa#
But I still haven't found
            Do#
What I'm looking for

    Do#
I believe in the Kingdom Come
                                Fa#
Then all the colors will bleed into one
                 Do#
But yes I'm still running

You broke the bonds

You loosened the chains You carried the cross

And my shame
     Fa#
And my shame
             Do#
You know I believed it
      Sol#             Fa#
But I still haven't found
            Do#
What I'm looking for
      Sol#             Fa#
But I still haven't found
            Do#
What I'm looking for
      Sol#             Fa#
But I still haven't found
            Do#
What I'm looking for
      Sol#             Fa#
But I still haven't found
            Do#
What I'm looking for
