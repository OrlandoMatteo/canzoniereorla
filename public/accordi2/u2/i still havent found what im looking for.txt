I have climbed the highest mountains
I have run through the fields
        Sol 
Only to be with you

I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her fingertips
               Sol 
It burned like fire
               Re 
This burning desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil

It was warm in the night

Then all the colors will bleed into one

You loosened the chains
You carried the cross
And my shame
           Sol 
And my shame
