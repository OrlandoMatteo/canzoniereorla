       Do#m  Sol#m  Si  Fa#

Do#m              Sol#m               Si
 The sea wants to kiss the golden shore
                    Fa#       Do#m
The sunlight warms your skin
                Sol#m              Si
All the beauty that's been lost before
                 Fa#    Do#m
Wants to find us again
              Sol#m        Si
I can't fight you anymore
                      Fa#   Do#m
It's you I'm fighting for
               Sol#m
The sea throws rocks together
    Mi             Fa#
But time leaves us polished stones

Do#m      Sol#m
 We can't fall any further
  Si         Fa#           Do#m
If  we can't feel ordinary love
              Sol#m
And we cannot reach any higher
Si            Fa#                Do#m  Sol#m  Si  Fa#
  If we can't deal with ordinary love

Do#m  Sol#m  Si  Fa#

Do#m       Sol#m
 Birds fly high in the summer sky
Si               Fa#     Do#m
 And rest on the breeze
                   Sol#m                 Si
The same wind will take care of you and I
                         Fa#
We'll build our house in the trees
Do#m             Sol#m
Your heart is on my sleeve
        Si                  Fa#
Did you put it there with a magic marker?
Do#m              Sol#m
For years I would believe
         Mi             Fa#
That the world couldn't wash it away

Do#m       Sol#m
 We can't fall any further
  Si         Fa#           Do#m
If  we can't feel ordinary love
              Sol#m
And we cannot reach any higher
Si           Fa#                Do#m  Sol#m  Si  Fa#
 If we can't deal with ordinary love

Do#m  Lamaj7    Si  Do#m  Lamaj7    Si  Do#m

Do#m       Sol#m
 We can't fall any further
   Si         Fa#           Do#m
If   we can't feel ordinary love
              Sol#m
And we cannot reach any higher
Si           Fa#                Do#m
 If we can't deal with ordinary love
          Sol#m
We can't fall any further
   Si         Fa#           Do#m
If   we can't feel ordinary love
              Sol#m
And we cannot reach any higher
Si           Fa#                Do#m  Sol#m  Si  Fa#
 If we can't deal with ordinary love...
