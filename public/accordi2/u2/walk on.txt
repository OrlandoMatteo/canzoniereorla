Rem     Do/Re                   Sol/Re
 And love is not the easy thing

The only baggage you can bring...
    Rem                  Do/Re
And love is not the easy thing....

The only baggage you can bring
   Sol/Re
Is all that you can't leave behind

Re  La  Sol  Mim7  Re  La  Sol  Mi

Re          La             Sol      Mim7
 And if the darkness is to keep us apart
Re          La                   Sol            Mi
 And if the daylight feels like it's a long way off
Re       La                      Sol
 And if your glass heart should crack
          Mim7             Re
And for a second you turn back
    La     Mi
Oh no, be strong

     Re       La
Walk on, walk on
         Sol
What you got they can't steal it
   Mim7
No they can't even feel it
     Re       La    Sol
Walk on, walk on...
            Mi7
Stay safe tonight

Re                La              Sol
 You're packing a suitcase for a place
               Mim7    Re
none of us has been
              La               Sol    Mi
A place that has to be believed to be seen
Re              La
 You could have flown away
  Sol                Mim7
A singing bird in an open cage
      Re         La             Mi7
Who will only fly, only fly for freedom

     Re       La
Walk on, walk on
            Sol
What you've got they can't deny it
      Mim7
Can't sell it, can't buy it
     Re       La   Sol
Walk on, walk on
            Mi7
Stay safe tonight
      Re
And I know it aches
     La
And your heart it breaks
            Mi7
And you can only take so much
 Sim  Sol Mim7  La  Sim
Walk on,
   Sol   Mim7  La
walk on

Re  La/Do#    Sol
Home, hard to know what it is if you've never had one
Re  La/Do#    Sol
Home, I can't say where it is but I know I'm going
Re   La/Do#
home
                 Mi
That's where the hurt is
  Re
I know it aches
       La
How your heart it breaks
            Mim7
And you can only take so much
        Sol  Re  La
Walk on,
             Mim7
All that you fashion
             Sol
All that you make
             Re
All that you build
             La
All that you break
             Mim7
All that you measure
             Sol
All that you steal
             Re          La
All this you can leave behind
             Mim7
All that you reason
             Sol
All that you sense...
