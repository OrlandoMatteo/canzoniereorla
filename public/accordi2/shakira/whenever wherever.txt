Do#m
Lucky you were born that far away so
Sol#7
So we could both make fun of distance
La
Lucky that I love a foreign land for
Mi                 Si
 The lucky fact of your existence
Do#m
Baby I would climb the Andes solely
Sol#7
 To count the freckles on your body
La
Never could imagine there were only
Mi                Si
 Too many ways to love somebody
Fa#m
Lo ro lo le lo le
Do#m
Lo ro lo le lo le
La              Si
Can't you see...I'm at your feet

Do#m   La
 Whenever, wherever
Mi        Si
 We're meant to be together
Do#m           La
I'll be there and you'll be near
Fa#m         Si
 And that's the deal my dear
Do#m       La
 They're over, you're under
Mi       Si
 You'll never have to wonder
Do#m       La
We can always play by ear
Fa#m            Si
 But that's the deal my dear

Do#m
Lucky that my lips not only mumble
Sol#7
 They spill kisses like a fountain
La
Lucky that my breasts are small and humble
Mi                    Si
 So you don't confuse  them with mountains
Do#m
Lucky I have strong legs like my mother
Sol#7
 To run for cover when I need it
La
And these two eyes that for no other
Mi                      Si
 The day you leave will cry a river
Fa#m
Lo ro lo le lo le

 They're over, you're under
Mi       Si
 You'll never have to wonder
Do#m       La
We can always play by ear

Le ro le le lo le, Le ro le le lo le
La
Think out loud
Si
Say it again
Fa#m
Le ro lo le lo le lo le
Do#m
Tell me one more time
La
That you'll live
Si          Sol#/Do
Lost in my eyes

Do#m   La
 Whenever, wherever
Mi        Si
 We're meant to be together
