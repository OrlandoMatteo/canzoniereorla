        La#m  Re#m  Sol#  Fam  Fa#  Sol#  La#m

Ladies up in here tonight

No fighting, no fighting

We got the refugees up in here

No fighting, no fighting

Shakira, Shakira

   La#m                             Fa#
 I never really knew that she could dance like this
Sol#                       Fam
 She makes a man want to speak Spanish
Fa#
 Como se llama,
Sol#
 bonita,
La#m
 mi casa, su casa  (Shakira, Shakira)
                 Fa#
Oh baby when you talk like that
Sol#         Fam
 You make a woman go mad
Fa#       Sol#          La#m
 So be wise and keep on

Reading the signs of my body
La#m  Fa#
  And I'm on tonight
            Sol#
You know my hips don't lie
        Fam
And I'm starting to feel it's right
Fa#                Sol#           La#m
 All the attraction, the tension

Don't you see baby, this is perfection

La#m
 Hey Girl, I can see your body moving

And it's driving me crazy

And I didn't have the slightest idea

Until I saw you dancing

And when you walk up on the dance floor

Nobody cannot ignore the way you move

your body, girl

And everything so unexpected - the way

you right and left it

So you can keep on taking it

La#m                                Fa#

Shakira, Shakira

                            La#m
Oh boy, I can see your body moving

Half animal, half man

I don't, don't really know what I'm doing

But you seem to have a plan

My will and self restraint

Have come to fail now, fail now

See, I am doing what I can, but I can't so

you know

That's a bit too hard to explain

La#m         Sol#
 Baila en la calle de noche
La#m
Baila en la calle de dia
            Sol#
Baila en la calle de noche
La#m

La#m
 Se√±orita, feel the conga, let me see you

move like you come from Colombia

Mira en Barranquilla se baila asi, say it!

Mira en Barranquilla se baila asi

Yeah

She's so sexy every man's fantasy

a refugee like me back with the Fugees

from a 3rd world country

I go back like when 'pac carried crates for

Humpty Humpty

I need a whole club dizzy

Why the CIA wanna watch us?

Colombians and Haitians

I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction

No more we do snatch ropes

Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our

own boats
La#m Fa#           Sol#
 I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
        Fam
And I'm starting to feel you boy
Fa#              Sol#        La#m
 Come on let's go, real slow

Baby, like this is perfecto

La#m  Fa#
  And I'm on tonight
            Sol#
You know my hips don't lie
        Fam
And I'm starting to feel it's right
Fa#                Sol#          La#m
 All the attraction, the tension

Don't you see baby, this is perfection
