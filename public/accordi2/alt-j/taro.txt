Indo--------china, Capa jumps Jeep,
Rem            Do
two feet creep up the road
Solm     Fa         Rem      Do
To photo, to record meat lumps and war
Solm          Fa
 They advance as does his chance,

                  Rem  Do  Solm
very yellow white flash
        Fa                   Rem
A violent wrench grips mass, rips light,
      Do
tears limbs like rags
Solm         Fa
Burst so high finally Capa lands
Rem           Do       Solm
Mine is a watery pit
         Fa
Painless with immense distance

     Dom                           La#
From medic from colleague, friend, enemy, foe
    Solm                Fa
Him five yards from his leg, from you,

Do not spray into eyes,

I have sprayed you into my eyes

3:10        PM, Capa pends death, quivers,
               Do
last rattles, last chokes
    Solm            Fa
All colors and cares glaze to gray,
Rem                Do
shriveled and stricken to dots
    Solm             Fa
The left hand grasps what the body grasps not,

                   Rem Do  Solm
Le photographe est mort
              Fa
Three, point, one, four, one, five,
 Rem            Do
alive no longer my amour,
Solm          Fa
Faded for home May of '54
    Rem        Do
Doors open like arms my love,
Solm           Fa
 Painless with a great closeness

   Dom                 La#
To Capa, to Capa, Capa dark after nothing,
    Solm           Fa
re-united with his leg and with you,
