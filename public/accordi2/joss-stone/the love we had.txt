    Lately baby, I've been thinking
    Sim7      Do#m7   Sim7
How good it was when you were here
Lamaj7     Sim7               Lamaj7    Sim7
 And it ain't the wine that I been drinking
Lamaj7 Sim7           Lamaj7    Sim7
 For once I feel my head is clear

Remaj7  Mi                Do#m7              Remaj7
  But early this morning, when I opened up my eyes
         Mi             Do#m7          Remaj7
That old lonesome feeling took me by surprise
            Mi              Do#m7      Remaj7
I guess you meant more to me than I realized
                            Mi
The love we had stays on my mind
    Do#m7                   Remaj7
The love we had stays on my mind

Lamaj7   Sim7 Lamaj7          Sim7    Lamaj7
  And boy, I've been remembering
    Sim7             Lamaj7      Sim7
The good times that we used to share
  Lamaj7 Sim7                  Lamaj7       Sim7   Lamaj7
My     thoughts of you don't have an ending
                Sim7    Lamaj7   Sim7
And memories of you are everywhere

Remaj7        Mi             Do#m7          Remaj7
 But why should I tell you, it's not your concern
        Mi
You win some, you lose some
          Do#m7         Remaj7
Well I've lost and I've learned
            Mi               Do#m7
It's just that I'm so lonely
        Remaj7
With no place to turn
                   Mi  Fa#m
And here at the end, I find
         Re           Do#7
The love we had stays on my mind

Fa#m         Mi
Girl, if you were nearer
Fa#m       Mi
If you had a mirror
Fa#m      Mi             Fa#m   Do#m7
Maybe you could count my tears
Fa#m       Mi
And if you were nearer
Fa#m         Mi
It would all be clearer
Fa#m       Mi            Fa#m
How I wish that you were here

Sim7                     Mi7add6
How I wish that you were here
Sim7                     Re/Mi
How I wish that you were here

Lamaj7  Sim7  Lamaj7  Sim7

Lamaj7  Sim7       Lamaj7   Sim7  Lamaj7
  And baby boy I was tired
       Sim7  Lamaj7       Sim7
So I laid down to dream for a little while
Lamaj7   Sim7          Lamaj7        Sim7
But lately I've been so, so uninspired
Lamaj7         Sim7    Lamaj7     Sim7
 Without the comfort of your smile

Remaj7      Mi               Do#m7
  But I'm not complaining
           Remaj7
Cuz that's how it goes
               Mi              Do#m7
There's always some heartache
              Remaj7
In this world I suppose
          Mi           Do#m7
But you can't imagine
      Remaj7
But nobody knows
                            Re/Mi
The love we had stays on my mind
    Do#m7               Remaj7
The love we had stays on my mind
                             Mi
The love we had stays on my mind
    Do#m7               Remaj7
The love we had stays on my mind
