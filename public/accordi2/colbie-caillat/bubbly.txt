Re                       La
I get the tinglies in a silly place


                  La
It starts in my toes
                 Lamaj7
and I crinkle my nose
            Re               La

I've been asleep for a while now
Re                            La
You tucked me in just like a child now
La                             Lamaj7
'cause every time you hold me in your arms
Re                         La
