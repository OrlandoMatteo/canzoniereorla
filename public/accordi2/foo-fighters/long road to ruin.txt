Do/Sol
  Hey now don't make a sound
                                    Fa
  Say hey have you heard the news today

One flag was taken down
                        Do/Sol
To raise another in its place

A heavy cross you bear
                           Fa
A stubborn heart remains unchanged

No harm, no life, no love

No stranger singing in your name

Lam       Sol6/Si
Maybe the season
    Do/Sol               Sol6/Si
The colors change in the valley skies
Lam             Sol6/Si
  Dear God I've sealed my fate
Do/Sol
Running through hell
Re
Heaven can wait

Fa
Long road to ruin
Do/Sol
There in your eyes
Fa                    Do/Sol  Do Do/Si
Under the cold streetlights
Lam
No tomorrow
Re             Fa
No dead end in sight

Do/Sol
Let's say we take this town
                        Fa
No king or queen of any state

Get up to shut it down
                               Do/Sol
Open the streets and raise the gates

I know a wall to scale
                         Fa
I know a field without a name

Head on without a care

Before it's way too late

Lam       Sol6/Si
Maybe the season
    Do/Sol               Sol6/Si
The colors change in the valley skies

Re             Fa

Do          Sol4/Si          Do
  For every piece to fall in place
        Sol4/Si        Do
Forever gone without a trace
       Sol4/Si         Lam7
Your horizon takes its shape
           Sol4/Si               Lam7
No turning back, don't turn that page

              Sol6/Si        Do/Sol
Come now, I'm leaving here tonight
                Sol6/Si        Lam7 *
Come now, let's leave it all behind
            Sol6/Si
Is that the price you pay
Do/Sol
Running through hell
