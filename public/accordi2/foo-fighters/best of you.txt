I've got another confession to make
        Laadd9
I'm your fool
                     Do#m7
Everyone's got their chains to break
        Laadd9
Holdin' you
                   Si4         Laadd9
Were you born to resist or be abused?
                       Do#m7               Si/Re#            Laadd9
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
                       Do#m7               Si/Re#            Laadd9
Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?
Do#m7            Si4          Laadd9
Are you gone and onto someone new?

                      Do#m7
I needed somewhere to hang my head
             Laadd9
Without your noose
                           Do#m7
You gave me something that I didn't have
           Laadd9
But had no use
                       Si
I was too weak to give in
               Laadd9
Too strong to lose
                    Do#m7
My heart is under arrest again
             Laadd9
But I break loose
                     Do#m7
My head is giving me life or death
             Laadd9
But I can't choose
                         Si
I swear I'll never give in
     Laadd9
I refuse
