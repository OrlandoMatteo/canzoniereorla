I know what you're thinkin'
Re             La    Fa#m  Mi
We were goin' down
Re              La    Fa#m  Mi
I can feel the sinkin'
Re                La    Fa#m  Mi
But then I came around
    Re            La           Fa#m  Mi
And everyone I've loved before
Re                 La    Fa#m  Mi
Flashed before my eyes
    Re               La      Fa#m  Mi
And nothin' mattered anymore
  Re               La   Fa#m  Mi
I looked into the sky

     Re                    La
Well we all want something better than
Fa#m                  Mi
We wish for something new
     Re                    La
Well we all want something beautiful
Fa#m               Mi
Wish for something true
     Re             La
Been lookin' for a reason and
Fa#m          Mi
Something to lose
         Re           La    Fa#m  Mi
When the wheels come down
         Re            La    Fa#m  Mi
When the wheels touch ground
        Re                  La
And you feel like it's all over

Now your head is spinnin'
Re                  La    Fa#m  Mi
Broken hearts will mend
Re            La      Fa#m  Mi
This is our beginning
Re           La   Fa#m  Mi
Comin to an end
