Solm
All my life I've been searching for something

Something never comes never leads to nothing

Nothing satisfies but I'm getting close

Closer to the prize at the end of the rope

All night long I dream of the day

When it comes around then it's taken away

Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most

Feel it come to life when I see your ghost

Solm    Lam Solm    La#m

Solm    Lam Solm    La#m

Solm                       Lam
Come down don't you resist
Solm                       La#m
 You've such a delicate wrist
Solm                      Lam
 And if I give it a twist
Solm                                 La#m
Something to hold when I lose my grip
Solm                          Lam
Will I find something in there
Solm                         La#m
 To give me just what I need?
Solm                     Lam
 Another reason to bleed
Solm
One by one hidden up my sleeve

One by one hidden up my sleeve

Hey don't let it go to waste

I love it but I hate the taste
Do/Mi Fa             La#
Wei---ght keeping me down

Solm   La#m

Solm                     Lam
 Will I find a believer
Solm                      La#m
 Another one who believes
Solm                     Lam
 Another one to deceive
Solm                           La#m
Over and over down on my knees
Solm                  Lam
 If I get any closer
Solm                     La#m
 And if you open up wide
Solm                      Lam
 And if you let me inside
Solm
On and on I've got nothing to hide

On and on I've got nothing to hide

Re#/Sol                      Solm
Hey don't let it go to waste

And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one

Done, done, on to the next one...

Done I'm done and I'm on to the next one
