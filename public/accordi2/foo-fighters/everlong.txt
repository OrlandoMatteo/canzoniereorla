Hello
     Sisus2
I've waited here for you
Solsus2 Sisus2
Everlong
Remaj7
Tonight
  Sisus2
I throw myself into
Solsus2             Sisus2
And out of the red, out of her head she sang
Remaj7
Come down
    Sisus2
And waste away with me
Solsus2    Sisus2
Down with me
Remaj7
Slow how
    Sisus2
You wanted it to be
Solsus2           Sisus2
I'm over my head, out of her head she sang


Re La 

     Re
And I wonder
La               Re
When I sing along with you


Si5                    Sol5                  Re5
If everything could ever feel this real forever
Si5                  Sol5                Re5
If anything could ever be this good again
Si5                    Sol5                  Re5
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
                          La5               Sol5
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang

Remaj7
Breathe out
   Sisus2
So I could breathe you in
Solsus2    Sisus2
Hold you in
Remaj7
And now
  Sisus2
I know you've always been
Solsus2             Sisus2
Out of your head, out of my head I sang


Re La 

     Re
And I wonder
La               Re
