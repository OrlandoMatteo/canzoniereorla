Si                      Fa#m11
Run and tell all of the angels
Mi
This could take all night
Si                      Fa#m11            Mi
Think I need a devil to help me get things right
Si                   Fa#m11
Hook me up a new revolution
       Mi
'Cause this one is a lie
   Si                      Fa#m11              Mi
We sat around laughing and watched the last one die

        Si                    Fa#m11
Now I'm looking to the sky to save me
Mi
Looking for a sign of life
Si                       Fa#m11          Mi
Looking for something to help me burn out bright

I'm looking for a complication
Mi
Looking 'cause I'm tired of lying
Sol              La                       Si  Fa#m11  Mi
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high

Si  Fa#m11  Mi

  Si                         Fa#m11
I think I'm done nursing the patience
Mi
It can wait one night
    Si                      Fa#m11          Mi
I'd give it all away if you give me one last try
Si                 Fa#m11         Mi
We'll live happily ever trapped if you just save my life
Si                           Fa#m11     Mi
Run and tell the angels that everything's alright...
