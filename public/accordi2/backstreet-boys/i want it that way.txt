You are, my fire,
Fa#m      Re      La
The one, desire,
Fa#m      Re      La
Believe, when I say,
Fa#m     Mi     La
I want it that way

Fa#m      Re      La
But we, are two worlds apart,
Fa#m      Re      La
Can't reach to, your heart,
Fa#m     Re      La
When you say,
Fa#m     Mi     La
That I want it that way

Tell me why, (Ain't nothin' but a heartache)
          Re           Mi        Fa#m
Tell me why, (Ain't nothin' but a mistake)
          Re           Mi        La
Tell me why, I never wanna hear you say
      Fa#m       Mi       La
I want it that way

 Fa#m                La
Now I can see that we're fallin' apart,
Re                    Mi
From the way that it used to be, (Yeah)
Fa#m
No matter the distance,
La
I want you to know,
 Re         Mi
That deep down inside of me...



You are, my fire,
The one, desire,
You are, You are, You are, You are...
(Don't wanna hear you say!)
