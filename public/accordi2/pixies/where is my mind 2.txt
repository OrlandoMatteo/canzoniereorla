          Mi                       Do#m          Sol#  La
With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Mi        Do#m      Sol#     La
 Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Mi                 Do#m
 Your head will collapse
            Sol#
But there's nothing in it
           La
And you'll ask yourself

Mi           Do#m   Sol#         La
 Where is my mind?   Where is my mind?
  Mi       Do#m     Sol#  La    Mi  Do#m  Sol#  La
Where is my mind?
  Mi   Sol#      La
Way out   in the water
       Lam      Do#m    Si
See it swimmin'

Mi                Do#m       Sol#   La
I was swimmin' in the Caribbean
Mi       Do#m               Sol#     La
 Animals were hiding behind the rock
Mi                 Do#m
 Except the little fish
         Sol#
But they told me, he swears
          La
Tryin' to talk to me, to me, to me

Mi           Do#m   Sol#         La
 Where is my mind?   Where is my mind?
  Mi       Do#m    Sol#  La    Mi  Do#m  Sol#  La
Where is my mind?
  Mi   Sol#      La
Way out   in the water
       Lam      Do#m   Si     Sim
See it swimmin'

          Mi                       Do#m           Sol#  La
With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Mi        Do#m      Sol#       La
 Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Mi                 Do#m
 Your head will collapse
           Sol#
If there's nothing in it
           La
And you'll ask yourself

Mi           Do#m   Sol#         La
 Where is my mind?   Where is my mind?
  Mi       Do#m     Sol#  La    Mi  Do#m  Sol#  La
Where is my mind?
  Mi   Sol#      La
Way out   in the water

See it swimmin'

Mi  Do#m  Sol#  La
