       Sol La

Re                 La
 Outside there's a box car waiting
Mim          Sol
 Outside the family stew
Re          La
 Out by the fire breathing
Mim             Sol                Re
 Outside we wait 'til face turns blue
           La
I know the nervous walking
Mim         Sol           Re
 I know the dirty beard hangs
           La
Out by the box car waiting
Mim              Sol
 Take me away to nowhere plains
Sim                 Sol               La
 There is a wait so long (so long, so long)
                    Re
You'll never wait so long

Sol   La              Re
      Here comes your man
Sol   La              Re
      Here comes your man
Sol   La              Re   La  Mim7  Sol
      Here comes your man

Re                La
 Big shake on the box car moving
Mim               Sol                  Re
 Big shake to the land that's falling down
                  La
Is a wind makes a palm stop blowing
  Mim                     Sol
A big, big stone fall and break my crown
Sim                 Sol               La
 There is a wait so long (so long, so long)
                    Re
You'll never wait so long

Sol   La              Re
      Here comes your man
Sol   La              Re
      Here comes your man
Sol   La              Re
      Here comes your man
Sol   La              Re   La  Mim  Sol
      Here comes your man
