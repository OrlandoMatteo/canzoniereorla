[ Re ]                     Lam
   Like the legend of the phoenix
Do                 Mim
  All ends with beginnings
Re                       Lam
  What keeps the planet spinning
Do                      Mim        Re
  The force from the beginning


Lam             Do
We've come too far
        Mim        Re
To give up who we are
   Lam              Do
So let's raise the bar
        Mim          Re
And our cups to the stars
