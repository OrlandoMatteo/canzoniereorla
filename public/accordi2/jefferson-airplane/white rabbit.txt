 One pill makes you larger
   Sol
And one pill makes you small
        Fa#
And the ones that mother gives you
        Sol
Don't do anything at all
       La     Do
Go ask Alice
           Re       La
When she's ten feet tall
       Fa#
And if you go chasing rabbits
        Sol
And you know you're going to fall
           Fa#
Tell 'em a hookah-smoking caterpillar
   Sol
Has  given you the call
     La     Do
Call Alice
     Re           La
When she was just small

Mi
 When the men on the chessboard
           La
Get up and tell you where to go
           Mi
And you've just had some kind of mushroom
         La
And your mind is moving low

       Fa#
Go ask Alice

I think she'll know

When logic and proportion
     Sol
Have fallen sloppy dead
        Fa#
And the White Knight is talking backwards
        Sol
And the Red Queen's off with her head
  La    Do         Re       La
Remember  what the dormouse said

Mi        La
Feed your head
Mi        La
Feed your head
