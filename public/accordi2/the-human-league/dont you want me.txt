         Fa                         Sol
You were working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
Fa           Sol
  When I met you
  Fa
I picked you out, I shook you up
    Sol
And turned you around
Fa                      Sol
Turned you into someone new
    Fa                                 Sol
Now five years later on you've got the world at your feet
   Fa                         Sol
Success has been so easy for you
    Fa                               Sol
But don't forget it's me who put you where you are now
    Fa                      Sol
And I can put you back down too

Lam               Mim
Don't   Don't you want me?
    Fa                             Rem                 Sol4 Sol
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see  me
Lam              Mim
Don't  Don't you want me?
    Fa                                Rem                Sol4 Sol
You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me
La
It's much too late to find

When you think you've changed your mind
      Do                               Mi
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry

Fa                 Sol
Don't you want me, baby?
Fa                  Sol
 Don't you want me? Oh!
Fa                 Sol
Don't you want me, baby?
Fa                  Sol
 Don't you want me? Oh!

      Fa                         Sol
I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
Fa             Sol
  That much is true
    Fa                          Sol
But even then I knew I'd find a much better place
Fa                     Sol
Either with or without you
    Fa                               Sol
The five years we have had have been such good at times
Fa             Sol
  I still love you
    Fa                              Sol
But now I think it's time I live my life on my own
  Fa                          Sol
I guess it's just what I must do

Lam               Mim

You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see  me
