Come on baby, dry your eyes
     Re#/Sol Sol#  Do#maj7
Wipe your    tears
                      Re# Fam7  Re#/Sol Sol#
Never like to see you cry

Won't you please forgive me

  I wouldn't ever try to hurt you
Fam9  Dom7    Do#maj7           Fam9
  I just needed someone to hold me
         Dom7          Do#maj7
To fill the void while you were gone
   La#m7                   Re#7sus4
To fill this space of emptiness

Of flesh and blood I'm made

Born to make mistakes

Fam9    Dom7     Do#maj7
  So many nights I longed to hold you
Fam9    Dom7    Do#maj7               Fam9
  So many times I looked and saw your face
              Dom7       Do#maj7
Nothing could change the way I feel
La#m7             Re#7sus4         Do#maj7
No one else could ever take your place

 Do#maj7   Re# Fam7  Re#/Sol Sol#  Do#maj7

...Please forgive me

(The tears I cry aren't tears of pain

They're only to hide my guilt and shame

I forgive you, now I ask the same of you

While we were apart I was human too)
