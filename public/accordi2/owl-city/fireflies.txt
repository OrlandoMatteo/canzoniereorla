Sol Do Fa  


Sol                Do
You would not believe your eyes
Fa                        Sol          Do                Fa
If ten million fireflies lit up the world as I fell asleep
Sol                      Do
'Cause they'd fill the open air
Fa
and leave teardrops everywhere
Sol                        Do                  Fa
you'd think me rude but I'd just stand and stare


Fa              Do         Sol
I'd like to make myself believe
            Fa     Do     Mim    Fa
that planet Earth turns slowly
         Fa               Do            Fa      Sol      Lam
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Fa                   Do          Re
'Cause everything is never as it seems


Sol                Do             Fa
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs
Sol                Do                Fa
as they tried to teach me how to dance
Sol         Do
A foxtrot above my head
Fa
a sockhop beneath my bed
Sol                 Do                    Fa
a disco ball is just hanging by a thread


Fa              Lam         Sol
I'd like to make myself believe
            Fa     Do     Mim    Fa
that planet Earth turns slowly
         Fa               Do            Fa      Sol      Lam
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Fa                   Do             Sol
'Cause everything is never as it seems
           Fa
When I fall asleep


Sol              Do          Fa
leave my door open just a crack

(please take me away from here)
Sol                  Do             Fa
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac

(please take me away from here)
Sol        Do                Fa
why do I tire of counting sheep

(please take me away from here)
Sol                 Do                 Fa
when I'm far too tired to fall asleep


Sol                      Do
To ten million fireflies
Fa         
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
Sol           Do                 Fa
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
Sol                  Do          
but I'll know where several are
Fa
if my dreams get real bizarre
       Sol                Do                 Fa
'cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar


Fa              Lam         Sol
I'd like to make myself believe
            Fa     Do     Mim    Fa
that planet Earth turns slowly
         Fa               Do            Fa      Sol      Lam
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
Fa                   Do             Re
'Cause everything is never as it seems
           Fa
When I fall asleep

Fa              Lam         Sol
I'd like to make myself believe
            Fa     Do     Mim    Fa

Fa                   Do                 Sol
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams...</pre>]
