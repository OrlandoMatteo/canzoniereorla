      Lam
I can feel it on the back of my tongue

All of the words getting trapped in my lungs
Do                  Re5                      Lam
Heavy like a stone, waiting for the river to run

I wanna lash out

I wanna let it out
             Fa                        Sol
'Cause I can feel it on the back of my tongue
                  Lam
On the back of my tongue

    Fa           Sol
Oh, hard to hold this fire inside me
Lam         Do
All I know, sometimes it's frightening
Fa           Sol
Hard to hold this fire inside me
Lam             Do                    Fa       Sol
Oh, oh oh, it's not really like me to lash out
        Lam         Do
I gotta let it out
        Fa        Sol
I wanna lash out
        Lam
I wanna lash out

Lam
I got something to say, might start a riot

Rip that tape from my mouth, I won't be quiet
       Do
'Cause everything is nothing
     Re                             Lam
'Til you realise it's something you want

I wanna lash out

I wanna let it out
             Do                        Re
'Cause I can feel it on the back of my tongue
                  Lam
On the back of my tongue

    Fa           Sol
Oh, hard to hold this fire inside me
Lam         Do
All I know, sometimes it's frightening
Fa           Sol
Hard to hold this fire inside me
Lam             Do                    Fa       Sol
Oh, oh oh, it's not really like me to lash out
        Lam         Do
I gotta let it out
        Fa        Sol
I wanna lash out
        Lam         Do
I gotta let it out

Lam
I can't be the cork, come out of the bottle

I can't be the cork, come out of the bottle

I can't be the cork, come out of the bottle

I can't be the cork, come out of the bottle
Fa        Sol
Lash out
        Lam         Do
I wanna let it out
             Fa                        Sol
'Cause I can feel it on the back of my tongue

On the back of my tongue
    Fa           Sol
Oh, hard to hold this fire inside me
Lam         Do
All I know, sometimes it's frightening
Fa           Sol
Hard to hold this fire inside me
Lam             Do                    Fa       Sol
Oh, oh oh, it's not really like me to lash out
