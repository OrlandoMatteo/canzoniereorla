Sim
 I like digging holes and hiding things inside them

When I'll grow old I hope I won't forget to find them
Mim                        Sol           La             Sim
'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

I built a home and wait for someone to tear it down

Then pack it up in boxes, head for the next town running

Sim
 I like standing still, boy that's just a wishful plan

Ask me where I come from, I'll say a different land
Mim7                      Sol          La             Sim
 But I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night

I can't get the numbers, and play the guessing name

It's just the place that changes, the rest is still the same
