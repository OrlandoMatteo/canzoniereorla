Fa
When did we forget

All the crazy things
             Rem
that made us feel so part of it?

Our youth, so confident
   La#
We played our heartstrings
                  Fa
Not caring if it ends

Try to learn to let go of all
                          Rem
those things that tie you down

Get rid of it, the voice inside that tells me that
    La#
I’m scared, yeah, scared as shit
                         Do
But I wanna let go of it now

So someone tell me

Fa
Why so serious?

Why are we so serious?
    Rem
Oh, why so serious?
                       La#
When did we get like this?
                                           Fa
I still remember we weren’t grown up like this

Oooh, oh

Fa
I don’t seem to get all the things that are happening
    Rem
And I can’t make sense of everything that’s inside my head
      La#                                           Fa
But I keep on thinking, there’s gotta be something said

Oh, seems we’ve lost it
                                Rem
That spark inside that tells us it’s all nonsense

Stop being so cautious
     La#                                 Do
With every mistake there comes a lesson learned

So someone tell me

Fa
Why so serious? (Serious)

Why are we so serious?
    Rem
Oh, why so serious? (Serious)
                      La#
When did we get like this?
                                           Fa
I still remember we weren’t grown up like this

Oooh, oh

Why so serious? (Serious)

Why are we so serious?
    Rem
Oh, why so serious? (Serious)

Can someone tell me
    La#
Did we forget about
                  Fa
Living with no regrets?

Oooh, oh

Fa
I wanna live in the now

I’m not gonna live in the past
      Rem
Don’t wanna care about what-ifs

‘Cause what if those things don’t last?
    La#                     Fa
And I wanna live with no regrets

I wanna live in the now

I’m not gonna live in the past
      Rem
Don’t wanna care about what-ifs

‘Cause what if those things don’t last?
    La#                    Do4    Do
And I wanna live with no regrets

So someone tell me
Fa
Why so serious?

Fa
Why so serious? (Serious)

Why are we so serious?
    Rem
Oh, why so serious? (Serious)
                      La#
