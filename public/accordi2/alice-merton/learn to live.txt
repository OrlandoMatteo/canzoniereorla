        La#m   Sol#

            La#m
They've got fire
              Sol#
Well I've got lightning bolts
          La#m
They keep hunting
          Sol#
Tryin' to kill my hope
    Fa#
And everywhere I go I see them
              Sol#       La#m
In the corner of my eye
Fa#
Shoutin' that it's over
                           Sol#
Shoutin' that I'd stop the fight
             Fa#
Can somebody tell me
             Re#m
How to win a fight
             La#m
Can somebody tell me
              Sol#
Is the fear inside?
        Fa#
I wanna learn how to live
            Re#m
Without the consequences
        La#m
I wanna learn how to live
            Sol#
Without the consequences

        Fa#    Re#m   La#m   Sol#
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh...
        La#m    Sol#   La#m
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh...

        La#m
Shaking fingers
          Sol#
Just gets harder now
       La#m
Try to stay calm
       Sol#
Try to come back down
    Fa#
But everywhere I go
                          Sol#      La#m
I see them in the corner of my eye
Fa#
Shoutin' that it's over
                         Sol#
Sayin' I should stop the fight
              Fa#
Will somebody tell me
