Sol                                             Doadd9
We both lie silently still, in the dead of the night.
             Sol                                Doadd9
Although we both lie close together, we feel miles apart inside.
          Sol                   Doadd9
Was it something I said, or something I did,
         Sol                Doadd9
did my words not come out right?
          Re                              Do
Though I tried not to hurt you, though I tried, but I guess that's why they say


Sol                   Doadd9
Every rose has its thorn.
           Sol                  Doadd9
Just like every night has its dawn.
           Sol       Re             Do       Sol
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song.
 Sol                   Do
Every rose has its thorn.

I listen to our favorite song, playing on the radio.
          Sol                                   Doadd9
Hear the DJ say love's a game of easy come and   easy go.
       Sol             Doadd9         Sol               Doadd9
But I wonder, does he know, has he ever felt like this?
       Re
And I know that you'd be here right now if I
Do
  coulda let you know, somehow I guess


Sol                   Doadd9
Every rose has its thorn.
           Sol                  Doadd9
Just like every night has its dawn.
           Sol      Re             Do       Sol
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song.
 Sol                   Do
Every rose has its thorn.

  Though it's been a while now, I can still feel so much pain.
Mim                  Re                      Do
 Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals, but the scar, that scar remains

   Sol                                            Doadd9
I know I coulda saved our love that night if I'd     known what to say.
Sol                               Doadd9
  Instead of making love we both  made our separate ways.
     Sol                      Doadd9             Sol                       Doadd9
And now I hear you've found somebody new, and that I never meant that much to you.
    Re                                    Do
To hear that tears me up inside, and to see you cuts me like a knife, I guess


Sol                   Doadd9
Every rose has its thorn.
           Sol                  Doadd9
Just like every night has its dawn.
             Sol     Re             Do       Sol
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song.
 Sol                   Do          Sol
Every rose has its thorn.</pre>]
