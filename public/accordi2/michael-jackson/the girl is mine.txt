      Solmaj7                  Lam7/Re
Every night, she walks right in my dreams,
        Solmaj7            Lam7/Re
Since I met her from the start.
       Solmaj7          Lam7/Re            Solmaj7          Mi7sus4
I'm so proud I am the only one, who is special in her heart.

            Lam7         Lam7/Re                    Solmaj7  Lam7/Re  Solmaj7
The girl is mine; ...        the doggone girl is mine.
Mi7sus4               Lam7       Lam7/Re                             (Solmaj7)
        I know she's mine; ...        because the doggone girl is mine.

I don't understand the way you think, saying that she's yours, not mine,
        Solmaj7          Lam7/Re                Solmaj7           Mi7sus4
Sending roses and your silly dreams; really just a waste of time.


              Lam7      Lam7/Re                    Solmaj7  Lam7  Solmaj7
Because she's mine;      ...the doggone girl is mine.
Mi7sus4                   Lam7   Lam7/Re                          (Solmaj7)
       Don't waste your time,      ...because the doggone girl is mine.

I love you more than he, (take you anywhere),
               Solmaj7              Lam7/Re
But I love you endlessly, (loving we will share).

            La#maj9             Re#maj7
So come and go with me, to one town.
        Do/Re             Re6                 Do/Re          Re6
But we,     both cannot have her, so it's,     one or the other.
         Do/Re                Re6                 Do/Re           Re6
And one,     day you'll dis-cover; that shes's     my girl for-ever and ever.

Don't build your hopes, to be let down, 'cos I really feel it's time.
              Solmaj7             Lam7/Re                 Solmaj7        Mi7sus4
I know she'll tell you; I'm the one for her, 'cos she said I blow her mind.



              Lam7      Lam7/Re                     Solmaj7  Am7/D, Solmaj7
Because she's mine;       ...the doggone girl is mine.

       Don't waste your time,      ...because the doggone girl is mine.
        


      Lam7/Re        Solmaj7                    Lam7/Re
She's mine, (she's mine), no, no, no, she's mine.

            Solmaj7              Lam7/Re
The girl is mine, (the girl is mine),
            Solmaj7              Lam7/Re
The girl is mine, (the girl is mine).

            Solmaj7        Lam7/Re
The girl is mine, (mine, mine),
           Solmaj7        Lam7/Re
Yep, she's mine, (mine, mine).
            Solmaj7        Lam7/Re
The girl is mine, (mine, mine),
           Solmaj7        Mi7sus4 N.C.
Yep, she's mine, (mine, mine).

The girl is mine...



         Lamaj7                                 Sim7/Mi
 Michael,       we're not going to fight about this, okay?



      Lamaj7                 Sim7/Mi              Lamaj7   Sim7/Mi
Paul,       I think, I told you; I'm a lover, not a fighter.
  


              Lamaj7
I've heard it all be-fore, Michael,
    Sim7/Mi                                  Lamaj7               Sim7/Mi
She told me that I'm her forever lover, you know, don't you remember?

                           Lamaj7                            Sim7/Mi
Well, after loving me, she said she couldn't love another.


                        
Is that what she said?


Lamaj7                        Sim7/Mi
 Yes, she said it; you keep dreaming.



               Lamaj7  
 I don't belie-ie-ieve it!
