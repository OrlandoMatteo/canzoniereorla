      Mim                Re/Fa#
As I drove across on the highway
     Mim          Re/Fa#
My jeep began to rock
          Mim                  Re/Fa#
I didn't know what to do so I stopped and got out
            Mim                      Re/Fa#
And looked down and noticed I got a flat

             Mim                      Re/Fa#
So I walked out, parked the car like sideways
          Mim              Re/Fa#
So I can find what I can fix
          Mim                              Re/Fa#
I looked around there were no cars on the highway
            Mim                  Re/Fa#
I felt a strange feeling like a mist

         Mim                            Re/Fa#
I walked down towards the end of the road
           Mim             Re/Fa#
And in the fog a woman appeared
         Mim                   Re/Fa#
She said don't you worry my friend I'll take care
          Mim                 Re/Fa#
Take my hand, I'll take you there


La6
Woah-oh
Sol       La              Sim       La
Take me to a place without no name
Sol        La             Sim       La
Take me to a place without no name


          Mim                     Re/Fa#
As she took me right through the fog
         Mim              Re/Fa#
I see a beautiful city appear
        Mim                   Re/Fa#           
Where kids are playin' and people are laughin'
      Mim
and smiling and
            Re/Fa#
No one's in fear

         Mim                       Re/Fa#
She said this is the place where no people
have pain
        Mim            Re/Fa#
And in love and happiness
              Mim                     Re/Fa#
She turned around looked down at my eyes and 
started cryin'
                 Mim              La6
She grabbed my hand, you got a friend

Woah-oh


Sol       La              Sim       La
Take me to a place without no name
Sol        La             Sim       La
Take me to a place without no name
Sol       La              Sim       La
Take me to a place without no name
Sol        La             Sim       La
Take me to a place without no name


              Mim                     Re/Fa#
She started likin' me kissin' me and huggin' me
              Mim                       Re/Fa#
She didn't really, really want me to leave
               Mim                   
She showed me places I've never seen 
  Re/Fa#
   things I've never done
             Mim                       Re/Fa#
This place really looks like a lotta fun


            Mim                          Re/Fa#
I seen the grass and the sky and the birds
         Mim                        Re/Fa#   
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
      Mim                    Re/Fa#
This place is filled with love and happiness
           Mim                 Re/Fa#
and not a world could I wanna leave

                                  
          Mim                       Re/Fa#  
So then I went in my pocket took my wallet on out
          Mim                       Re/Fa#
With my pictures of my family and girl
             Mim                    Re/Fa#
This is the place that you choose to be with me
           Mim                        Re/Fa#  La6
When you thought you could be in another world


Sol       La              Sim       La
Take me to a place without no name
Sol        La             Sim       La
Take me to a place without no name
Sol       La              Sim       La
Take me to a place without no name
Sol        La             Sim       La
