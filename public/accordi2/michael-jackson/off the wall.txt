         Mim7
When the world is on your shoulder
      Mim7
Gotta straighten up your act and boogie on
       Mim7
If you cant hang with the feelin'
           Mim7
Then there ain't no room for you this side of town
      Mim7
Cause we're the party people night and day
Mim7
Livin' crazy that's the only way
