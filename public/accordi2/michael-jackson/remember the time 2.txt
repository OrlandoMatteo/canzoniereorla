         Do7#9
Do you remember when we fell in love
       Fam
We were young and innocent then
         Do7#9
Do you remember how it all began
      Fam
It just seemed like heaven

So why did it end?
         Do7#9
Do you remember back in the fall
          Fam7
We'd be together all day long
         Do7#9
Do you remember us holding hands
        Fam7
In each other's eyes we'd stare

Tell me

         Do7#9
Do you remember the time when we fell in love
         Fam7
Do you remember the time when we first met, girl
         Do7#9
Do you remember the time when we fell in love
         Fam7
Do you remember the time

         Do7#9
Do you remember how we used to talk
        Fam
You know we'd stay on the phone at night 'til dawn
         Do7#9
Do you remember all the things we said
      Fam
Like I love you so I'll never let you go
         Do7#9
Do you remember back in the spring
      Fam
Every morning birds would sing
         Do7#9
Do you remember those special times
                Fam
They'll just go on and on in the back of my mind

        Do7#9
Do you remember the time when we fell in love
         Fam7
Do you remember the time when we first met, girl
         Do7#9
Do you remember the time when we fell in love
         Fam7
Do you remember the time

      Do#maj7     Fam7      Do#maj7          Fam9
Those sweet memories will always be dear to me
     Do#maj7                    Fam9
And, girl, no matter what was said
       La#m7                Do7b9
I will never forget what we had

Now, baby

        Do7#9
Do you remember the time

(do you remember)

When we fell in love
         Fam7
Do you remember the time when we first met, girl
         Do7#9
Do you remember the time when we fell in love
         Fam7
Do you remember the time

Remember, my baby
         Do7#9
Do you remember the time...
