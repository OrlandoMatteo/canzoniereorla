Ben, the two of us need look no more,
 Sol                          Re7/Fa#
we both found what we were looking for.

With a friend to call my own, I'll never be alone.
     Mi7                Lam           Re7            
And you my friend will see, you've got a friend in me.

 Ben, you're always running here and there,
  Sol                          Re7/Fa#
 you feel you're not wanted anywhere.
 Solmaj7             Si7/Do        Si7                 Fa7
If you ever look behind, and don't like what you find,
          Mi7                   Lam          Re7           
 there's something you should know, you've got a place to go.

I used to say :    I and me.  Now it's us,    now it's we.

Ben, most people would turn you away,
Sol                    Re7/Fa#
I don't listen to a word they say.
  Solmaj7                 Re7/Fa#                     Fa7
They don't see you as I do, I wish they would try to,
     Mi7                Lam             Re7         Sol  Do Re7
I'm sure they'd think again, if they had a friend like Ben,
      Sol    Do Re7          Soladd9 Sol
like Ben,          like Ben</pre>]
