La
Each time the wind blows, I hear your voice so
Mim
 I call your name
La
Whispers at morning, our love is dawning
Mim
 Heaven's glad you came

    Re
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
Rem                         Fa#m
I'm so proud to say I love you
     Sol
Your love's got me high, I long to get by
Domaj7                 Mi4
This time is forever, love is the answer

La
I hear your voice now, you are my choice now
Mim
 The love you bring
La
Heaven's in my heart, at your call I hear harps
Mi4
 And angels sing

    Re
You know how I feel, this thing can't go wrong
Rem                           Fa#m7
I can't live my life without you
  Sol
I just can't hold on, I feel we belong
Domaj7                         Mi4
My life ain't worth living, If I can't be with you

Chorus:
Mim                        La
 I just can't stop loving you
Mim                        La
 I just can't stop loving you
Mim                   Rem           Do          Mi4
 And if I stop, then tell me just what will I do
                                La
'Cause I just can't stop loving you

   La
At night when the stars shine, I pray in you I'll find
Mim
 A love so true
     La
When morning awakes me, will you come and take me
Mi4
 I'll wait for you

    Re
You know how I feel, I won't stop until
Rem                         Fa#m7
I hear your voice saying I do
     Sol
This thing can't go wrong, this feeling's so strong
      Domaj7                         Mi4
Well, my life ain't worth living, if I can't be with you

We can change all the world tomorrow

We can sing songs of yesterday
