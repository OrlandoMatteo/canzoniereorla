[<pre>Re#        Do#sus2         Fa#
  I was wandering in the rain
         Sol#             Re#
Mask of life, feelin' insane
          Do#sus2            Fa#
Swift and sudden fall from grace
          Sol#         Re#
Sunny days seem far away
          Do#sus2              Fa#
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
          Sol#                Re#
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
          Do#sus2           Fa#
On and on and on it came
          Sol#                 
wish the rain just let me

[Chorus 1]
Mimaj7         La
How does it feel (How does it feel)
Mimaj7         La
How does it feel
Remaj7         Sol
How does it feel
La
When you're alone
                La6  
And you're cold inside


Re#       Do#sus2       Fa#
Here abandoned in my fame
         Sol#       Re#
Armageddon of the brain
    Do#sus2      Fa#
KGB was doggin' me
           Sol#                  Re#
Take my name and just let me be
          Do#sus2              Fa#
Then a begger boy called my name
        Sol#                  Re#
Happy days will drown the pain
        Do#sus2       Fa#             
On and on and on it came and again,
       Sol#
and again, and again...


Mimaj7         La
How does it feel (How does it feel)
Mimaj7         La
How does it feel
Remaj7         Sol
How does it feel
Remaj7         Sol
How does it feel
Mimaj7         La
How does it feel (How does it feel)
Mimaj7         La
How does it feel
Remaj7         Sol
How does it feel
La
When you're alone
                 La6    
And you're cold inside

Mimaj7         La
How does it feel (How does it feel)
Mimaj7         La
How does it feel
Remaj7         Sol
How does it feel
Remaj7         Sol
How does it feel
Mimaj7         La
How does it feel (How does it feel)
Mimaj7         La
How does it feel
Remaj7         Sol
How does it feel
La
When you're alone
                  La6  
And you're cold inside

                   Mi
Like stranger in Moscow
Resus2           Sol      La
  Oh I?m gonna say,

                   Mi
Like stranger in Moscow
Resus2           Sol      La   
  Oh I?m gonna say,

               Mi      Resus2
We're talkin' danger
                       Sol        La
We're talkin' danger, baby
                  Mi     Resus2  Sol   La
Like stranger in Moscow

                Mi      Resus2
We're talkin' danger
                      Sol       La
We're talkin' danger, baby
                  Mi   Resus2   Sol   La
Like stranger in Moscow

             Mi        Resus2
I'm livin' lonely
                   Sol     La
I'm livin' lonely, baby
             Mi
Stranger in Moscow

Resus2 Sol La
