Hello August moon, where are the stars of the night
La#maj7                           Sol#maj7            Sol#maj7(2x)
You promised me too soon cause it's been cloudy all night
        Re#maj7                     Fa#maj7 
And the weatherman said, if you're not well stay in bed
    Rem7                                      Sol7 
And I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
           Dom7                           Fa7sus4
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay home in bed

And I'll be thinking of you until the stars are no more
        Re#maj7                     Fa#maj7 
If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you
Rem7                                    Sol7 
We'll make a wish and then we'll kiss, our love forever true

It seems you don't know, we reached the higher mountain
Mi7sus4                  Remaj7
Every time I seem to disappear
    Lamaj7                       Mimaj7
And together we will fly, we'll dance up in the heavens

I can really feel it when you're near, ooh
