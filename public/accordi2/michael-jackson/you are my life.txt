Mi          Fa#m         Sol#m        La
Once, all alone, I was lost, in a world of strangers.
Mi          Fa#m         Sol#m        La  Si
No one to trust, on my own, i was lonely.
Do#m          Do/Mi               Fa#m      
You suddenly appeared. It was cloudy before,
     La          Si
now it's all clear.
Do#m               Do/Mi       Fa#m    
You took away the fear. And you brought
                   La/Si
me back to the light.


            Mi                Fa#m         
You are the sun, you make me shine. 
                Sol#m              Fa#mÂ 
More like the stars, that twinkle at night.
            Mi                 Fa#m   
You are the moon, close in my heart. 
           Sol#m                  La/Si
You're my daytime my nighttime, my world.
           Mi
You are my life.


Mi          Fa#m      Sol#m            La          Mi 
Now, i wake up everyday. With this smile upon my face.
         Fa#m           Sol#m           La
No more tears, no more pain. Cos you love me.
Do#m          Do/Mi              Fa#m              
You help me understand, that love is the answer to
     La    Si
all that i am.
Do#m             Do/Mi            Fa#m    
I, i'm a better man. Since you taught me
                 La/Si
by sharing your life.


            Sol#m                    Fa#m
You gave me strength, when i was destroyed.
            Do                      Fa#m
You gave me hope when all hope was lost.
            Sol#m                     La
You opened my eyes, when i couldn't see.
        Fa#m                     Si
Love is always here waiting for me. 


            Mi                Fa#m             
You are the sun, you make me shine. 
                Sol#m                  Fa#m
More like the stars, that twinkle at night.
            Mi                 Fa#m     
You are the moon, close in my heart. 
            Sol#m                La/Si
You're my daytime my nighttime, my world.
           Mi
You are my life.</pre>]
