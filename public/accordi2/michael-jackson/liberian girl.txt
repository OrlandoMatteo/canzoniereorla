[<pre>Mim
Liberian girl
                 Lam
You came and you changed my world
  Sim
A love so brand new

Mim
Liberian girl
                 Lam
You came and you changed me girl
  Sim
A feeling so true

Chorus:
  Do
Liberian girl

You know that you came
        Mim
And you changed my world,

Just like in the movies,
Fa#5
With two lovers in a scene

And she says do you love me
       Si5
And he says so endlessly
                     Mim     Lam  Sim
I love you, Liberian girl

Mim
Liberian girl
                   Lam
More precious than any pearl
     Sim
Your love so complete

Liberian girl
                 Lam
You kiss me then ooh, the world
    Sim
You do this to me


  Do
Liberian girl

You know that you came
        Mim
And you changed my world,

I wait for the day,
         Fa#5
When you have to say I do

And I'll smile and say it too
       Si5
And forever we'll be true
                     Mim
I love you, Liberian girl
        Lam
All the time

  Si                 Mim
I love you Liberian Girl,
        Lam
All the time
  Si                 Mim
I love you Liberian girl,
        Lam
All the time</pre>]
