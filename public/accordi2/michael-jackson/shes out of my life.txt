Mi
She's out of my life
La#dim    Mi      La#dim    Mi
She's out of my life
La               Si           Sol#            Do#m
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
Fa#m             Si           Sol#            Do#m
I don't know whether to live or die
Fa#m
And it cuts like a knife
Si
She's out of my life

Mi-Fa#m


Mi
It's out of my hands
La#dim    Mi      La#dim    Mi
It's out of my hands
La             Si      Sol#            Do#m
To think for two years she was here
Fa#m           Si             Sol#                 Do#m
And I took her for granted I was so cavalier!
Fa#m
Now the way that it stands 
Si                  Mi
She's out of my hands


Sol            La           La         Mi
So I've learned that love's not possession
Sol            La           La         Mi
And I've learned that love won't wait
Sol            La           Sol#        Do#m
Now I've learned that love needs expression
Fa#m                  Si
But I learned too late


Mi
She's out of my life
La#dim   Mi      La#dim   Mi
She's out of my life
La              Si            Sol#            Do#m
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Fa#m            Si            Sol#            Do#m
Kept my love for her locked deep inside!
Fa#m
And it cuts like a knife
Si
She's out of my...life
