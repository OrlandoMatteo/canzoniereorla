[<pre>Lam  Sol  Fa
        There's something I have to say to you,
Lam      Sol                    Fa
 If you promise you'll under-stand.
Lam            Sol           Fa                     
 I cannot con-tain myself, when in your presence,
Mim7
 I'm so humble.
Bm7b5                                        Mi7
 Touch me, don't hide our love, woman to man.

Lam

             Lam
She's just a lover, who's doin' me by,
It's worth the giving, it's worth the try.
You cannot cleave it, or put it in the furnace,
You cannot wet it; you cannot burn it.


Lam                      Mi7
 She wants to give it, (aah, she wants to give it).
Lam                      Mi7

            Lam
It's just a feeling; you have to soothe it,
You can't neglect it; you can't abuse it.
It's just desire; you cannot waste it,
Then, if you want it; then, won't you taste it.


Lam                      Mi7
 She wants to give it, (aah, she wants to give it).

Fa             Mi7                  Lam
 One thing in life you must under-stand;
Fa             Mi7             Lam
 The truth of lust, woman to man.
Fa            Mi7                 Lam
 So open the door, and you will see;
             Bm7b5                           Mi7
There are no secrets; make your move; set me free.


                 Fa           Mi7        Lam
Because, there's something a-bout you, baby,
              Famaj7   Mi7         Lam
That makes me want to give it to you.
                Fa           Mi7        Lam
I swear there's something a-bout you, baby.

Famaj7
 Just promise me; whatever we say, 
or whatever we do to each other:
Bm7b5                              Mi7 
 For now, we'll make a vow to just; 
keep it in the closet.


Lam

           Lam
If you can get it, it's worth a try,
I really want it; I can't deny.
It's just desire, I really love it,

'Cos if it's aching, you have to rub it.


Lam                      Mi7
 She wants to give it, (aah, she wants to give it).

Fa              Mi7                 Lam
 Just open the door, and you will see;
Fa             Mi7               Lam
 This passion burns, inside of me.
Fa             Mi7               Lam
 Don't say to me, you'll never tell;
         Bm7b5                          Mi7
Touch me there, make the move, cast the spell.


                 Fa           Mi7        Lam
Because, there's something a-bout you, baby,

That makes me want to give it to you.
