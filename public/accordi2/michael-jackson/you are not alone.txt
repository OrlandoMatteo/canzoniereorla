[<pre>                Do                    Lam
Another day has gone, I'm still all alone,
               Rem                       Sol
How could this be? You're not here with me.
                Do                       Lam
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why,
               Rem                          Sol
Did you have to go, and leave my world so cold?

    Do               La7              Fa
Everyday I sit and ask myself : How did love slip away ?
Rem                                Sol
Something whispers in my ear and says that...


            Do                        Lam
You are not alone, for I am here with you.
                  Rem                 Sol
Though you're far away, I am here to stay.
                 Do                        Lam
But you are not alone, for I am here with you,
                 Rem                         Sol
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart,
                 Do
But you are not alone.

Just the other night I thought I heard you cry,
            Rem                        Sol
Asking me to come, and hold you in my arms.
                 Do                            Lam
I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear,
                     Rem                       Sol
But first I need your hand, then forever can begin.
