Sim
 I'm only human

I'm only—I'm only—

I'm only human, human
Sim
  Maybe I'm foolish,

Maybe I'm blind

Thinking I can see through this

And see what's behind

Got no way to prove it

So maybe I'm lying

Don't put your blame on me


Take a look in the mirror

 Some people out of luck
Sim                            La
 Some people think I can solve them

 Lord heavens above

 Don't ask my opinion,

Don't ask me to lie

Then beg for forgiveness

For making you cry,

For making you cry
