                        Dom
I saw the fire in your eyes
                        Sol#
I saw the fire when I looked into your eyes
                              Dom
You tell me things you wanna try
                          Sol#
I know temptation is the devil in disguise
                          Dom
You risk it all to feel alive, oh yeah
                            Sol#
You're offering yourself to me like sacrifice
                               Dom
You said you did this all the time
                          Sol#
Tell me you love me if I bring you to the light

             La#
It's like a dream
          Dom
What she feels with me
             La#         Dom
She loves to be on the edge
         La#      Dom
Her fantasy is okay with me
          La#         Sol
Then suddenly, baby says

              Dom
Take my breath  away
     Dom      La#      Sol#
And make it last forever, babe
Sol#
Do it now or never, babe
              Dom
Take my breath  away
   Dom   La#       Sol#
Nobody does it better, babe
                 
Bring me close to

                           Dom
Want me to hold onto you tight
                              Sol#
You pull me closer, feel the heat between your thighs
                                  Dom
You're way too young to end your life
                           Sol#
Girl, I don't wanna be the one who pays the price

                 La#
Oh, It's like a dream
          Dom
What she feels with me
             La#         Dom
She loves to be on the edge
         La#      Dom
Her fantasy is okay with me
          La#         Sol
Then suddenly, baby says

              Dom
Take my breath  away
     Dom      La#      Sol#
And make it last forever, babe
Sol#
Do it now or never, babe
              Dom
Take my breath  away
   Dom   La#       Sol#
Nobody does it better, babe
Sol#
Bring me close to heaven, babe
          
Take my breath

Dom        Sol#  Solm             Dom
Oh, oh-oh-ooh,   and they'll see me
Sol#       Solm
Oh-oh-oh-ooh
Dom            Sol#     Solm
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Dom            Sol#   Solm
Oh-oh, oh-oh, ohh, ohh

              Dom
Take my breath  away (Take my breath away)

Do it now or never, babe
              Dom
Take my breath  away (Take my breath away)

Nobody does it better, babe
Sol#
We'll be close to heaven, babe

Take my breath  away (Take my breath away)

Bring me close to heaven, babe
