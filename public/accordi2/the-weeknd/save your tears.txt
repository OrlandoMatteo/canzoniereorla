[<pre>Do
Ooh, na na, yeah

Do           Lam                       Mim
  I saw you dancing in a crowded room
            Sol
You look so happy when I'm not with you
Do              Lam                            Mim
  But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
         Sol
A single teardrop falling from your eyes

Do              Lam    Mim       Sol
  I don't know why I run away
Do               Lam         Mim       Sol
  I'll make you cry when I run away

Do              Lam                             Mim
  You could've asked me why I broke your heart
             Sol
You could've told me that you fell apart
Do                Lam                         Mim
  But you walked past me like I wasn't there
            Sol
And just pretended like you didn't care

Do         Lam         Mim       Sol
  I don't know why I run away
Do               Lam         Mim       Sol
  I'll make you cry when I run away

Rem         Lam                       Fa
   Take me back 'cause I wanna stay ay
            Fa/Sol
  Save your tears for another
Do           Lam                    Mim   Sol
  Save your tears for another day    
Do            Lam                   Mim   Sol
   Save your tears for another day  

Do             Lam                             Mim
   I made you think that I would always stay
              Sol
  I said some things that I should never say
Do                    Lam                           Mim
  Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
                    Sol
  And now you won't love me for a second time

Do              Lam    Mim       Sol
  I don't know why I run away
        Do               Lam         Mim       Sol
Oh girl   I'll make you cry when I run away

Rem               Lam                       Fa
   Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay ay
            Sol
  Save your tears for another
Rem      Lam                        Fa
   I realize that I'm much too la ate
            Fa/Sol
  And you deserve someone better
Do         Lam                   Mim           Sol
Save your tears for another day  (Ooh, yeah)

  I'll make you cry when I run away

Do         Lam                    Mim
