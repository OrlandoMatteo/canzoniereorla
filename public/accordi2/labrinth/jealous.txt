 I'm jealous of the rain
      Do       Fa       Lam
 That falls upon your skin
      Fa      Sol       Do
 It's closer than my hands have been

 I'm jealous of the rain

 I'm jealous of the wind
      Do       Fa            Lam
 That ripples through your clothes
      Fa      Sol         Do
 It's closer than your shadow

 There's nothing to forgive
                            Fa                  Lam
 But I always thought you'd come back, tell me all you found was
 Do             
   Heartbreak and misery
 Fa                     Rem                      Fa

 You're happy without me

 I'm jealous of the nights

 Oh, I'm jealous of the nights

 Love that was in here
 Fa        Sol       Do
 Gone for someone else to share
         Fa       Sol      Lam
 Oh, I'm jealous of the love, cause
