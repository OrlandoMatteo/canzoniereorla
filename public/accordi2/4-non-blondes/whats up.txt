[<pre>Sol  Lam  Do  Sol  x2


Sol
Twenty-five years and my life is still
Lam
Trying to get up that great big hill
   Do               Sol
Of hope for a destination
Sol
I realized quickly when I knew I should
         Lam
That the world was made of this brotherhood
   Do                      Sol
Of man, for whatever that means


         Sol
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
        Lam
Just to get it all out, what's in my head
      Do                         Sol
and I - I am feeling a little peculiar
         Sol
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
      Lam
and I take a deep breath and I get real high and
  Do                                           Sol
I scream at the top of my lungs "What's going on?"


            Sol           Lam
And I said "Heyeyeyeyey Heyeyey"
        Do                 Sol
I said "Hey, what's going on?"
            Sol           Lam
And I said "Heyeyeyeyey Heyeyey"
        Do                 Sol
I said "Hey, what's going on?"


Sol     Lam  Do   Sol
Ooh, Ooh Ooh
Sol     Lam  Do   Sol
Ooh, Ooh Ooh


      Sol                   Lam
And I try, oh my God do I try
              Do                  Sol
I try all the time, in this institution
      Sol                    Lam
And I pray, oh my god do I pray
                    Do
I pray every single day
          Sol
For a revolution


         Sol
And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
        Lam
Just to get it all out, what's in my head
      Do                         Sol
and I - I am feeling a little peculiar
         Sol
And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
      Lam
and I take a deep breath and I get real high and
  Do                                           Sol
I scream at the top of my lungs "What's going on?"


            Sol           Lam
And I said "Heyeyeyeyey Heyeyey"
        Do                 Sol
I said "Hey, what's going on?"
            Sol           Lam
And I said "Heyeyeyeyey Heyeyey"
        Do                 Sol
I said "Hey, what's going on?"


            Sol           Lam
And I said "Heyeyeyeyey Heyeyey"
        Do                 Sol
I said "Hey, what's going on?"
            Sol           Lam
And I said "Heyeyeyeyey HeyeYEYEYE"
        Do                 Sol
I said "Hey, what's going on?"


Sol     Lam  Do   Sol
Ooh, Ooh Ooh


Sol
Twenty-five years and my life is still
Lam                                      Do
Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
           Sol
For a destination</pre>]
