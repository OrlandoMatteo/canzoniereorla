[<pre>Do                    Sol
You’re broken down and tired
Lam                   Fa
Of living life on a merry-go-round
Do                     Sol
And you can’t find the fighter
Lam                  Fa
But I see it in you so we gonna walk it out
Do       Sol        Lam       Fa
And moooooooooove mountains
Fa
We gonna walk it out
Do      Sol       Lam         Fa
And moooooooooove mountains


            Do
And I’ll rise up
I'll rise like the day
       Sol
I’ll rise up
I'll rise unafraid
      Lam
I'll rise up
                            Fa
And I’ll do it a thousand times again
          Do
And I’ll rise up
High like the waves
      Sol
I’ll rise up
In spite of the ache
      Lam
I'll rise up
                            Fa
And I’ll do it a thousands times again
    Do
For you
    Sol
For You
    Lam
For You
    Fa
For You


Do                     Sol
When the silence isn’t quiet
Lam                     Fa
And it feels like it’s getting hard to breathe
Do                      Sol
And I know you feel like dying
Lam                  Fa
But I promise we’ll take the world to its feet
Do       Sol        Lam        Fa
And mooooooooooove mountains
Fa
Take the world to its feet
Do       Sol        Lam       Fa
And moooooooooove mountains


Do
And I’ll rise up
I'll rise like the day
Sol
I’ll rise up
I'll rise unafraid
Lam
I'll rise up
                          Fa
And I’ll do it a thousand times again
Do
For you
Sol
For you
Lam
For You
Fa
For You


Do                     Sol
All we need, all we need is hope
                    Lam
And for that we have each other
                    Fa
And for that we have each other
Do
We will rise
Sol
We will rise
Lam
We’ll rise, ohh ohhh
Fa
We’ll rise

[Slower chorus]
Do
I’ll rise up
Rise like the day
Sol
I’ll rise up
In spite of the ache
Lam                       Fa
I will rise a thousands times again


Do
And we’ll rise up
High like the waves
Sol
We’ll rise up
In spite of the ache
Lam
We’ll rise up
                           Fa
And we'll do it a thousands times again
Do
For You
Sol
For You
Lam
For You

For You


Do     Sol     Lam    Fa
Ooh,  Ooh,  Ahh,  Ahh</pre>]
