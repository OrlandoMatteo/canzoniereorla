    Si                         Misus2
The strands in your eyes that color them wonderful
Si                    Fa#/La# Mi/Sol#
Stop me and steal my breath
    Si                            Misus2
And emeralds from mountains that thrust towards the sky
Si                     Fa#/La# Mi/Sol#
Never revealing their depth



    Si    Fa#/La#    Mi/Sol#        Fa#/La#
And tell me  that we belong together
Si          Fa#/La#      Mi/Sol#          Fa#
 Dress it up with the trappings of love
     Si       Fa#/La#       Mi/Sol#      Fa#/La#
I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips
  Si                       Fa#/La#                     Mi/Sol#   Fa#
Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above



Si       Misus2
I'll be your cryin' shoulder
Si              Fa#/La#  Mi/Sol#
I'll be love's suicide
    Si       Misus2
And I'll be better when I'm older
Si           Fa#/La#    Mi/Sol#        Si   Misus2
I'll be the greatest fan of your life



Si  Fa#/La#  Mi/Sol#

    Si          Misus2
And rain falls angry on the tin roof
   Si                  Fa#/La#  Mi/Sol#
As we lie awake in my bed
    Si                          Misus2
And you're my survival, you're my living proof
   Si                     Fa#/La#  Mi/Sol#
My love is alive and not dead



    Si    Fa#/La#    Mi/Sol#        Fa#/La#
And tell me  that we belong together
Si          Fa#/La#      Mi/Sol#          Fa#
 Dress it up with the trappings of love
     Si       Fa#/La#       Mi/Sol#      Fa#/La#
I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips
  Si                       Fa#/La#                     Mi/Sol#   Fa#
Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above



    Si       Misus2
And I'll be your cryin' shoulder
Si              Fa#/La#  Mi/Sol#
I'll be love's suicide
    Si       Misus2
And I'll be better when I'm older
Si           Fa#/La#    Mi/Sol#        Si
I'll be the greatest fan of your life



         Sol#m7
And I've dropped out, I've burned up,
     Fa#                          Mi
I've fought my way back from the dead
  Sol#m7
I Tuned in, I turned on,
  Fa#                         Mi  La  Fa#
remembered the thing that you said



    Si       Misus2
And I'll be your cryin' shoulder
Si              Fa#/La#  Mi/Sol#
I'll be love's suicide
    Si       Misus
And I'll be better when I'm older
Si           Fa#/La#    Mi/Sol#
I'll be the greatest fan of your
