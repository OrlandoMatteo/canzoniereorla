Just a perfect day,
Sol            Do
Drink Sangria in the park,
Fa               Rem
And then later, when it gets dark,
      Mi
We go home.
Lam     Re
Just a perfect day,
Sol           Do
Feed animals in the zoo
Fa          Rem
Then later, a movie, too,
         Mi
And then home.

Weekenders on our own.

It's such fun.
Lam     Re
Just a perfect day,

You made me forget myself.
Fa               Rem
I thought I was someone else,

Someone good.
