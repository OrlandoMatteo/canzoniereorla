Do                         Fa6
Holly came from Miami, F.L.A.
Do                               Fa6
Hitch-hiked her way across the USA
Do                   Remadd9
Plucked her eyebrows on the way
Fa6                      Re
Shaved her legs and then he was a she

          Do
She says, Hey babe
                   Fa6
Take a walk on the wild side
Do
Hey honey
                   Fa6
Take a walk on the wild side

Do Fa6 Do Fa6

Do                         Fa6
Candy came from out on the Island
Do                                  Fa6
In the backroom she was everybody's darlin'
Do            Remadd9
But she never lost her head
Fa6               Re
Even when she was giving head

          Do
She says, Hey babe
                   Fa6
Take a walk on the wild side
        Do
I Said, Hey baby
                   Fa6
Take a walk on the wild side

And the coloured girls go

Do                      Fa6

Do                      Fa6

doo do doo do doo do do doo do doo do doo do do doo..
Do                      Fa6
doo do doo do doo do do doo....

Do Fa6 Do Fa6

Do                             Fa6
Little Joe never once gave it away
Do                       Fa6
Everybody had to pay and pay
  Do                Remadd9
A hustle here and a hustle there
Fa6                 Re
New York City's the place where they say,
Do                           Fa6
Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
        Do
I said, Hey Joe
       Fa6
Take a walk on the wild side

Do Fa Do Fa

Do                                Fa6
Sugar Plum Fairy came and hit the streets
Do                                   Fa6
Lookin' for soul food and a place to eat
Do          Remadd9
Went to the Apollo
    Fa6               Re
You should've seen em go go go
           Do                           Fa6
They said, Hey shuga Take a walk on the wild side
        Do
I Said, Hey babe
       Fa6
Take a walk on the wild side
           Do
All right, huh

Do Fa Do Fa

Do                       Fa6
Jackie is just speeding away
Do                               Fa6
Thought she was James Dean for a day
Do               Remadd9
Then I guess she had to crash
Fa6               Re
Valium would have helped that bash
      Do
Said, Hey babe,
                   Fa6
Take a walk on the wild side
        Do
I said, Hey honey,
                   Fa6
Take a walk on the wild side

and the coloured girls say,

Do                      Fa6
doo do doo do doo do do doo do doo do doo do do doo..
Do                      Fa6
doo do doo do doo do do doo do doo do doo do do doo..
Do                      Fa6
