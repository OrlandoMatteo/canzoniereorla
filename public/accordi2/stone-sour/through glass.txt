[<pre>                      Do
I'm looking at you through the glass
                     Re7
Don't know how much time has passed
            Mim
Oh, God it feels like forever
            
But, no one ever tells you
       Do
That forever feels like home
 Re7                           Mim
Sitting all alone inside your head


             Do
How do you feel?
                Re7
That is the question
          Mim
But, I forget
                                 
You don't expect an easy answer
      Do
When something is like a soul
          Re7
Becomes initialized
                    Mim
And folded up like paper dolls and little notes
         
You can't expect the bitter folks
       Do
And while your outside looking in
     Re7
Describing what you see
   Mim                                           
Remember what your staring at is me


                            Do
Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
                      Re7
Don't know how much time has past
                       Mim
All I know is that it feels like forever
          
And no one ever tells you
        Do
That forever feels like home
 Re7                            Mim
Sitting all alone inside your head

             Do
How much is real?
             Re7
So much to question
       Mim
An epidemic of the mannequins

Contaminating everything
        Do
And if that came from the heart
    Re7
It never did, right from the start
Mim
  Just listen to the noises (Null and void instead of voices)
Do
  Before You tell yourself
      Re7
It's just a different scene
  Mim
Remember it's just different from what you've seen


                       Do
I'm looking at you through the glass
                        Re7
Don't know how much time has passed
            Mim
Oh, God it feels like forever
           
But, no one ever tells you
         Do
That forever feels like home
 Re7                            Mim
Sitting all alone inside your head
                            Do
Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
                     Re7
Don't know how much time has past
                       Mim
All I know is that it feels like forever
             
And no one ever tells you
        Do
That forever feels like home
 Re7                            Mim
Sitting all alone inside your head


                Do          Re7           Mim        
And it's the stars...the stars...that shine for you
                Do          Re7          Mim        
And it's the stars...the stars...that lie to you


                       Do
I'm looking at you through the glass
                        Re7

                            Do
Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
                     Re7
Don't know how much time has past
                       Mim
All I know is that it feels like forever
             
And no one ever tells you
        Do
That forever feels like home
 Re7                            Mim
Sitting all alone inside your head


                Do          Re7           Mim        
And it's the stars...the stars...that shine for you

Do Re7 Mim  
Do Re7 Mim 
               Do                    Re7         Mim 
Oh, when the stars...Oh, when the stars...they lie</pre>]
