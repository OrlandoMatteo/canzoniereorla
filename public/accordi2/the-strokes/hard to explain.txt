       Do  Lam7  Sol

Sol    Mim9 Lam7   Do
 Was an honest man
Re7
Asked me for the phone

Tried to take control
     Do
Oh, I don't see it that way
Lam7                     Sol
I don't see it that way
       Mim9    Lam7   Do
Oh, we shared some ideas
Re7
All obsessed with fame

Says we're all the same
     Do
Oh, I don't see it that way
Lam7
I don't see it that way

Sol           Mim   Sim
Raised in Carolina
         Lam7
"I'm not like that"
Sol         Mim     Sim
Trying to remind her
         Lam7
When we go back

  Sol
I missed the last bus, I'll take the next train
  Sim7
I try but you see, it's hard to explain
  Sol
I say the right things, but act the wrong way
  Sim7                     Sim7/La
I like it right here, but I cannot stay
  Sol
I watch the TV forget what I'm told
        Sim7               Sim7/La
Well, I am too young, and they are too old
    Sol
The joke is on you, this place is a zoo
        Sim7
"You're right it's true"

Sol  Mim9  Lam7  Do  Re7

Do  Lam7  Sol

Sol      Mim9  Lam7  Do
 Says he can't decide
  Re7
I shake my head to say

Everything's just great
     Do
Oh, I just can't remember
Lam7
I just can't remember

    Sol
Oh, man, can't you see I'm nervous, so please
   Sim7                 Sim7/La
Pretend to be nice, so I can be mean
  Sol
I miss the last bus, we take the next train
   Sim7
I try but you see, it's hard to explain
