 He seemed impressed by the way you came in
Sim
"Tell us a story
  Mi
I know you're not boring"
Sim                Mi
 I was afraid that you would not insist
Sim
"You sound so sleepy
     Mi
just take this, now leave me"
       Sim
I said please don't slow me down
             Mi
If I'm going too fast
   Sim              Mi
You're in a strange part of our town...

You're not trying hard enough,
      Fa#m             Sol
Our lives are changing lanes
    La             Re
You ran me off the road,
    Fa#m

Sol        La
I'm now taking over,
Re        Fa#m
You're no longer laughing
Sol         La
I'm not drowning fast enough

Sim                    Mi
 Now every time that I look at myself
Sim
"I thought I told you
     Mi
this world is not for you"
Sim                           Mi
 The room is on fire as she's fixing her hair
Sim
"you sound so angry
     Mi
just calm down, you found me"
Sim
I said please don't slow me down
