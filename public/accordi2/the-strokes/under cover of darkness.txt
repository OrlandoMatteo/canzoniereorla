        Si    Do#m

Si
Slip back out of whack at your best
        Re#m
It's a nightmare
    Sol#m           Mi
So I'm joining the army
Si
No house phones, but can I still call?
         Re#m
Will you wait for me now?
Mi                      Do#m7
We got the right 'cause they'll fight to use it
Sol#m7              Do#m7
Got everything but you can just choose it
  Si
I won't just be a puppet on a string

Sol#m7  Mi      Si   Fa#7
Don't   go that way
Sol#m7 Mi       Si   Fa#7
I'll   wait for you
        Sol#m7
And I'm tired of all your friends
Mi
Listening at your door
      Si                    Fa#7
But I want what's better for you
Sol#m7   Mi        Si          Fa#7
So long, my friend and adversary
                  Si    Do#m
But I'll wait for you

Si
Get dressed, jump out of bed into a vest
   Re#m
Are you OK?
Mi
I've been all around this town
                                      Si
Everybody's singing the same song for ten years

Sol#m7 Mi       Si   Fa#7
I'll   wait for you
     Sol#m7 Mi       Si  Fa#7
Will you    wait for me too?
         Sol#m7
And they sacrifice their lives
            Mi
And they're lying about those odds
            Si
Oh, they've said it a billion times
                    Fa#7
and they'll say it again
Sol#m7  Mi   Si          Fa#7
So long my adversary and friend

Do#m  Re#m  Do#m  Si   Sol  Si  Sol#m

Do#m  Re#m  Do#m  Si  Fa#/La#

Sol#m7  Mi      Si   Fa#7
Don't   go that way
Sol#m7 Mi       Si   Fa#7
I'll   wait for you
        Sol#m7
And I'm tired of all your friends
Mi
Banging down your door
Si                               Fa#7
Get up in the morning, yelling "No more!"
Sol#m7   Mi        Si          Fa#7
So long, my friend and adversary
                  Si
But I'll wait for you
