La#m      Sol#
 I know I took the path
     Do#            Fa#
that you would never want for me
La#m      Sol#                  Do#
 I know I let you down, didn’t I?
La#m     Sol#
 So many sleepless nights
      Do#              Fa#
Where you were waiting up on me
La#m             Sol#            Do#
 Well I’m just a slave unto the night
      La#m          Sol#
Now remember when I told you
           Do#                Fa#
that’s the last you’ll see of me
  La#m          Sol#               Do#
Remember when I broke you down to tears
La#m      Sol#
 I know I took the path
     Do#             Fa#
that you would never want for me
La#m        Sol#                  Do#
 I gave you hell through all the years

   Do#  Fa#   Do#     Fa#   Do#
So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
  Fa#   Do#     Sol#
I bet my life on you
Do#  Fa#   Do#     Fa#   Do#
I, I bet my life, I bet my life
  Fa#   Do#     Sol#
I bet my life on you

La#m        Sol#
 I’ve been around the world
    Do#         Fa#
and never in my wildest dreams
La#m          Sol#             Do#
 Would I come running home to you
La#m         Sol#
 I’ve told a million lies
    Do#          Fa#
But now I tell a single truth
La#m            Sol#          Do#
 There’s you in everything I do
      La#m          Sol#
Now remember when I told you
           Do#                Fa#
that’s the last you’ll see of me
  La#m          Sol#               Do#
Remember when I broke you down to tears
La#m      Sol#
 I know I took the path
     Do#             Fa#
that you would never want for me
La#m        Sol#                  Do#
 I gave you hell through all the years

   Do#  Fa#   Do#     Fa#   Do#
So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
  Fa#   Do#     Sol#
I bet my life on you
Do#  Fa#   Do#     Fa#   Do#
I, I bet my life, I bet my life
  Fa#   Do#     Sol#
I bet my life on you

Re#m                   Sol#7
Don’t tell me that I’m wrong
                        La#m
I’ve walked that road before
  Sol#/Do           Do#
I left you on your own
    Re#m                          Sol#7
And please believe them when they say
                         La#m
That it’s left for yesterday
        Sol#/Do            Do#
And the records that I’ve played
La#7      Re#m        Sol#7
Please forgive me for all I’ve done

   Do#  Fa#   Do#     Fa#   Do#
So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
  Fa#   Do#     Sol#
I bet my life on you
Do#  Fa#   Do#     Fa#   Do#
I, I bet my life, I bet my life
  Fa#   Do#     Sol#
I bet my life on you

Do#  Fa# Do#   Fa# Do#   Fa# Do# Sol#
