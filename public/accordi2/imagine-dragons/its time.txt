So this is what you meant when 
you said that you were spent?
La                                    
And now it's time to build from the
                                
bottom of the pit right to the top,
  Sim
Don't hold back
Sol
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check


Re                                         La
I don't ever want to let you down
                                         Sim
I don't ever want to leave this town
             Sol
'Cause after all
Sol
This city never sleeps at night...


Re
It's time to begin, isn't it?
                    Sim
I get a little bit bigger, but then, 
                                   Mim
I'll admit, I'm just the same as I was
                 Sol
Now don't you understand

That I'm never changing who I am?

So this is where you fell, and I am left to sell
La
the path that heaven runs through miles of clouded hell, 
             Sim
right to the top
Sim
Don't look back
Sol
Turning to rags and give the commodities a rain check

Sim                          La
This road never looked so lonely,
                              Sol
This house doesn't burn down slowly,
Mim            Sol         La
to ashes, to ashes...
