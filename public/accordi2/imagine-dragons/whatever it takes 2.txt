La#m Sol# Fam    La#m Sol# Fam

La#m
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Sol#
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Fam
Everybody circling is vulturous

Negative, nepotist
La#m
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Sol#
Everybody praying for the end of times
Fam
Everybody hoping they could be the one

I was born to run, I was born for this
La#m
Whip, whip
              Sol#
Run me like a racehorse
               Re#
Pull me like a ripcord
                  Fam
Break me down and build me up
               La#m
I wanna be the slip, slip
               Sol#
Word upon your lip, lip
                Re#
Letter that you rip, rip
                  Fam
Break me down and build me up

            Fa#   Do#
Whatever it takes
                  Sol#             La#m
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
                 Fa#   Do#
I do whatever it takes
                    Sol#                    La#m
Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
            Fa#   Do#
Whatever it takes
     Sol#                    La#m
Yeah take me to the top I'm ready for
            Fa#   Do#
Whatever it takes
                  Sol#
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins


I do what it takes
La#m
Always had a fear of being typical
Sol#
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Fam
Always hanging on to the visual

I wanna be invisible
La#m
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Sol#
Everybody needs to be a part of them
Fam
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son

I was born to run, I was born for this
La#m
Whip, whip
              Sol#
Run me like a racehorse
               Re#
Pull me like a ripcord
                  Fam
Break me down and build me up
               La#m

               Sol#
Word upon your lip, lip
                Re#
Letter that you rip, rip
                  Fam
Break me down and build me up

            Fa#   Do#
Whatever it takes

             La#m
I do what it takes
               Sol#
Hypocritical, egotistical
                   Fam
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
                La#m                         Sol#
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
    Fam
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
        Re#m9
I'm an apostrophe
           Sol#                               Fam
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
                                      La#m
I'm just a product of the system of catastrophe
          Sol#                      Fam
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased

And when I am deceased
              La#m                         Sol#
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
              Fam7
And leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee
             La#m
I do what it takes

            Fa#   Do#
Whatever it takes
                  Sol#             La#m
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
                 Fa#   Do#
I do whatever it takes
                    Sol#                    La#m
Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
            Fa#   Do#
Whatever it takes
     Sol#                    La#m
Yeah take me to the top I'm ready for
            Fa#   Do#
Whatever it takes
                  Sol#             La#m
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins

I do what it takes
