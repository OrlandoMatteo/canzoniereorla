[<pre>           Do
When the days are cold
           Sol
And the cards all fold
           Lam
And the saints we see
          Fa
Are all made of gold
           Do
When your dreams all fail
           Sol
And the ones we hail
           Lam
Are the worst of all
          Fa
And the blood's run stale

Do                    Sol
  I want to hide the truth
                  Lam
I want to shelter you
                   Fa
But with the beast inside
                       Do
There's nowhere we can hide
                  Sol
No matter what we breed
                     Lam
We still are made of greed
                   Fa
This is my kingdom come
                   Do
This is my kingdom come


Do                  Sol
  When you feel my heat
             Lam
Look into my eyes
                     Fa
It's where my demons hide
                     Do
It's where my demons hide
              Sol
Don't get too close
            Lam
It's dark inside
                     Fa
It's where my demons hide
                     Do
It's where my demons hide


           Do
When the curtain's call
           Sol
Is the last of all
           Lam
When the lights fade out
          Fa
All the sinners crawl
          Do
So they dug your grave
           Sol
And the masquerade
           Lam
Will come calling out
          Fa
At the mess you made

Do                       Sol
  Don't want to let you down
              Lam
But I am hell bound
                       Fa
Though this is all for you
                       Do
Don't want to hide the truth
                  
                  Sol
No matter what we breed
                     Lam
We still are made of greed
                   Fa
This is my kingdom come
                   Do
This is my kingdom come


Do                  Sol
  When you feel my heat
             Lam
Look into my eyes
                     Fa
It's where my demons hide
                     Do
It's where my demons hide
              Sol
Don't get too close
            Lam
It's dark inside
                     Fa
It's where my demons hide
                     Do
It's where my demons hide


Do                        Sol
  They say it's what you make
                 Lam
I say it's up to fate
                 Fa
It's woven in my soul
                  Do
I need to let you go
                        Sol
Your eyes they shine so bright
                    Lam
I want to save that light
                    Fa
I can't escape this now
                   Do
Unless you show me how


Do                  Sol
  When you feel my heat
             Lam
Look into my eyes
                     Fa
It's where my demons hide
                     Do
It's where my demons hide
              Sol
Don't get too close
            Lam
It's dark inside
                     Fa
It's where my demons hide
                     Do
It's where my demons hide</pre>]
