La#                           Fa7
  There was a game we used to play
         Dom
We would hit the town on friday night
    Solm        Fa
And stay in bed until sunday
La#                Fa
  We used to be so free
        Dom
We were living for the love we had and
Solm             Fa
Living not for reality

It... was...

Just my imagination
Fa
Just my imagination
Dom
Just my imagination
Solm  Fa
It... was...

  There was a time I used to pray
       Dom
I have always kept my faith in love
         Solm                    Fa
It's the greatest thing from the man above
La#                  Fa
  The game I used to play
            Dom
I've always put my cards upon the table
       Solm                   Fa
Let it never be said that I'd be unstable
