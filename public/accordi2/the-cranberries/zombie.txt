[<pre>Mim Do Sol Re/Fa#  4x

Mim       Do                Sol                Re/Fa# 
Another head hangs lowly, child is slowly taken
Mim               Do                    Sol               Re/Fa# 
And the violence caused such silence, who are we mistaken 
        Mim                        Do 
But you see it's not me, it's not my family
        Sol                               Re/Fa# 
In your head, in your head, they are fighting 
           Mim                              Do                                                         
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns 
         Sol                             Re/Fa#
in your head, in your head, they are crying

[Chorus 1]
        Mim            Do            Sol             Re/Fa# 
In your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie 
               Mim            Do            Sol             Re/Fa# 
What's in your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie 

Mim Do Sol Re/Fa# x2


Mim        Do                  Sol              Re/Fa# 
Another mother's breaking heart is taking over
Mim                Do               Sol            Re/Fa# 
When the violence causes silence, we must be mistaken
         Mim                   Do  
It's the same old theme since 1916
        Sol                                  Re/Fa# 
In your head, in your head, they're still fighting
           Mim                              Do  
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
        Sol                            Re/Fa# 
In your head, in your head, they're dying


        Mim            Do            Sol             Re/Fa# 
In your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie 
               Mim            Do            Sol             Re/Fa# 
What's in your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie
