Mi      Lamaj7                  Si7
  Oh my life is changing everyday
               Mi
Every possible way
Mi           Lamaj7                           Si7
  And oh, my dreams, it's never quite as it seems
                  Mi
Never quite as it seems

Mi                          Lamaj7
  I know I felt like this before
                            Si7
But now I'm feeling it even more
                     Mi
Because it came from you

Mi                   Lamaj7
  Then I open up and see
                           Si7
The person falling here is me
                   Mi
A different way to be


     Sol  Domaj7  Sol  Domaj7

Mi       Lamaj7                 Si7
  I want more, impossible to ignore
               Mi
Impossible to ignore
Mi             Lamaj7                    Si7
  They'll come true, impossible not to do
                  Mi
Impossible not to do

Mi                   Lamaj7
  Now I tell you openly
                                Si7
You have my heart so don't hurt me
                    Mi
For what I couldn't find

Mi                   Lamaj7
  Talk to me amazing mind
                        Si7
So understanding and so kind
                     Mi
You're everything to me

Mi      Lamaj7                  Si7
  Oh my life is changing everyday
               Mi
Every possible way
Mi           Lamaj7                           Si7
  And oh, my dreams, it's never quite as it seems
                         Mi
'cause you're a dream to me. Dream to me.
