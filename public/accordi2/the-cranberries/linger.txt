If you, if you could return,
             La6
don't let it burn, don't let it fade
                       Domaj7
I'm sure I'm not being rude, but it's just your attitude,
                  Sol
It's tearing me apart, it's ruining everything
   Re                                               La6
I swore, I swore I would be true, and honey, so did you
                            Domaj7
So why were you holding her hand? Is that the way we stand?
                        Sol
Were you lying all the time? Was it just a game to you?
              Re                       La6          La
But I'm in so deep You know I'm such a fool for you
                               Domaj7
You got me wrapped around your finger, ah, ha, ha
                      Sol
Do you have to let it linger?

Do you have to, do you have to,

      La6
Oh, I thought the world of you
          Domaj7
I thought nothing could go wrong,
          Sol
But I was wrong I was wrong
   Re                                      La
If you, if you could get by, trying not to lie,
                         Domaj7
Things wouldn't be so confused and I wouldn't feel so used,
                       Sol
But you always really knew, I just wanna be with you
              Re                       La6       La
But I'm in so deep You know I'm such a fool for you

Do you have to let it linger?

Do you have to, do you have to,

Do you have to let it linger?

              Re                       La6       La
And I'm in so deep You know I'm such a fool for you
                               Domaj7
You got me wrapped around your finger, ah, ha, ha

Do you have to, do you have to,
