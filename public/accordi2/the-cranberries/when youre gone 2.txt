Re#         Dom
 Hold on to love
            Solm
That is what I do
              La#        Re#
Now that I've found you
          Dom
And from above
            Solm
Everything's stinking,
             La#
They're not around you
    Re#                    Dom
And in the night I could be helpless,
          Solm               La#
I could be lonely sleeping without you
    Re#                    Dom
And in the day, everything's complex,
              Solm                    La#
There's nothing simple, when I'm not around you
      Re#                   Dom
But I miss you when you're gone,
            Solm  Sol#
That is what  I do

Hey, baby!
         Re#             Dom
And it's going to carry on,
            Solm   Sol#
That is what  I knew
          Re#   Dom   Solm   La#
Hey, baby

Re#         Dom
 Hold on to my hands,
          Solm
I feel I'm sinking,
          La#        Re#
Sinking without you
          Dom
And to my mind,
           Solm
Everything's stinking,
           La#
Stinking without you
    Re#                    Dom
And in the night I could be helpless,
          Solm               La#
I could be lonely sleeping without you
    Re#                   Dom
And in the day, everything's complex,
              Solm                    La#

      Re#                   Dom

That is what  I do

Hey, baby!
         Re#             Dom
And it's going to carry on,
            Solm     Sol#
