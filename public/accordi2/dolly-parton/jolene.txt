  Lam      Do       Sol       Lam
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
     Sol                                  Lam
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
  Lam      Do       Sol      Lam
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
   Sol                   Mim             Lam
Please don't take him just because you can

       Lam        Do
Your beauty is beyond compare
       Sol                Lam
With flaming locks of auburn hair
       Sol             Mim              Lam
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
       Lam             Do
Your smile is like a breath of spring
       Sol                  Lam
Your voice is soft like summer rain
       Sol         Mim             Lam
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene


    Lam             Do
He talks about you in his sleep
     Sol                Lam
There's nothing I can do to keep
       Sol             Mim               Lam
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
    Lam            Do
And I can easily understand
    Sol                 Lam
How you could easily take my man
         Sol                  Mim           Lam
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene


  Lam      Do       Sol       Lam
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
      Sol                                 Lam
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
  Lam      Do       Sol       Lam
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
  Sol                    Mim             Lam
Please don't take him just because you can


Lam                    Do
You could have your choice of men
    Sol              Lam
But I could never love again
   Sol           Mim           Lam
He's the only one for me, Jolene
   Lam               Do
I had to have this talk with you
    Sol           Lam
My happiness depends on you
    Sol           Mim           Lam
Whatever you decide to do, Jolene

 
  Lam      Do       Sol       Lam
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
      Sol                                 Lam
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
  Lam      Do       Sol       Lam
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
  Sol                    Mim            Lam
Please don't take him even though you can</pre>]
