[<pre>Do                 Do/Si
  There's no combination of words
        Lam                   Lam/Sol
I could put on the back of a postcard
Fa              Do/Mi
  No song that I could sing
    Rem            Sol
But I can try for your heart,
Do     Do/Si                   Lam                 Lam/Sol
  Our dreams, and they are made out of real things
       Fa           Do/Mi
Like a shoe box of photographs
     Rem          Sol
With sepia-toned loving
Do             Do/Si
  Love is the answer
             Lam                       Lam/Sol
At least for most of the questions in my heart like
Fa            Do/Mi                   Rem
  Why are we here? And where do we go?
                  Sol
And how come it's so hard?
Do                 Do/Si
  It's not always easy and
          Lam            Lam/Sol
Sometimes life can be deceiving
Fa                   Do/Mi                Rem                  Sol
  I'll tell you one thing, it's always better when we're together


Fa                   Sol
  Mmmm, it's always better when we're together
Fa                         Sol
  Yeah, we'll look at the stars and we're together
Fa                   Sol
  Well, it's always better when we're together
Fa                   Sol
  Yeah, it's always better when we're together

                 Do
And all of these moments
           Do/Si                     Lam           Lam/Sol
Just might find their way into my dreams tonight,
      Fa                    Do/Mi
But I know that they’ll be gone
         Rem            Sol
When the morning light sings
           Do          Do/Si
And brings new things
      Lam               Lam/Sol
For tomorrow night you see
     Fa               Do/Mi
That they’ll be gone too,
         Rem               Sol
Too many things I have to do
                    Do                 Do/Si
But if all of these dreams might find their way
        Lam             Lam/Sol
Into my day to day scene
       Fa            Do/Mi
I'd be under the impression
      Rem              Sol
I was somewhere in between
          Do
With only two,
            Do/Si
Just me and you,
            Lam               Lam/Sol
Not so many things we got to do
   Fa                Do/Mi
Or places we got to be
            Rem              Sol
We'll sit beneath the mango tree, now


Fa                   Sol
  Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Fa                       Sol
  Mmmm, we're somewhere in between together
Fa                   Sol
  Well, it's always better when we're together
Fa                   Sol
  Yeah, it's always better when we're together


Do     Do/Si     Lam        Lam/Sol
  Mmm mmm mm mm mmm mm mm mmm
Fa          Do/Si     Rem   Sol
  Mm mm mm mm mmm mmmm mm mmm

Rem                     Sol
  I believe in memories they look so
Rem                      Sol
  So pretty when I sleep hey now and
Rem         Sol
  When I wake up you look so
  Rem                      Sol
  Pretty sleeping next to me but there is
Fa                Sol
  Not enough time there is no
Fa                     Sol
  No song I could sing and there is no
Rem/Fa                  Sol
  Combination of words I could say
           Rem/Fa                     Sol
But I will still tell you one thing
We're better together
