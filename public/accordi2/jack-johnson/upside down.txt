[<pre>Mi
Who's to say
Mi
What's impossible
Fa#m
Well they forgot
Fa#m
This world keeps spinning
         Mi
And with each new day
Mi                    Fa#m          Fa#m
I can feel a change in everything
                           Mi                 Mi
And as the surface breaks reflections fade
                Fa#m                   Fa#m
But in some ways they remain the same
                    Mi                     Mi
And as my mind begins to spread its wings
                    Fa#m
There's no stopping curiosity


Fa#m                             Mi      Fa#m
I want to turn the whole thing upside down
La             Si                    Mi        Fa#m
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
La    Si                        Mi         Fa#m
I'll share this love I find with everyone
La       Si                      Mi          Fa#m
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
La      Si                             Mi
I don't want this feeling to go away

Mi
Who's to say
Mi
I can't do everything
Fa#m
Well I can try
                               Mi
And as I roll along I begin to find
                          Fa#m
Things aren't always just what they seem


    Fa#m                     Mi     Fa#m
I want to turn the whole thing upside
 La            Si                    Mi        Fa#m
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
 La      Si                        Mi       Fa#m
I'll share this love I find with everyone
 La      Si                      Mi          Fa#m
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
 La      Si                              Sol#m        Fa#m
This world keeps spinning and there's no time to waste
      Sol#m                  La                      Si
Well it all keeps spinning spinning round and round and
Mi          Fa#m
Upside down
La          Si                         Mi          Fa#m
Who's to say what's impossible and can't be found
La            Si                      Mi
I don't want this feeling to go away</pre>]
