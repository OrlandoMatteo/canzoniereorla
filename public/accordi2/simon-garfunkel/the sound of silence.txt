[<pre>Lam                        Sol
   Hello darkness, my old friend,
                           Lam
I've come to talk with you again,
                     Fa       Do
Because a vision softly creeping,
                       Fa       Do
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
        Fa                             Do
And the vision that was planted in my brain
            Do/Si  Lam
Still remains
Do           Sol        Lam
Within the sound of silence.


                        Sol
In restless dreams I walked alone
                        Lam
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
                   Fa        Do
'neath the halo of a street lamp,
                          Fa        Do
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
        Fa                                        Do
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
                    Do/Si  Lam
That split the night
 Do              Sol        Lam
And touched the sound of silence.


                         Sol
And in the naked light I saw
                           Lam
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
                   Fa       Do
People talking without speaking,
                   Fa        Do
People hearing without listening,
               Fa                       Do
People writing songs that voices never share
              Do/Si  Lam
And no one dare
Do           Sol        Lam
Disturb the sound of silence.


                         Sol
Fools said I, you do not know
                      Lam
Silence like a cancer grows.
                     Fa           Do
Hear my words that I might teach you,
                    Fa           Do
Take my arms that I might reach you.
       Fa                           Do   Do/Si Lam 
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
   Do
And echoed
       Sol        Lam
In the wells of silence


                         Sol
And the people bowed and prayed
                     Lam
To the neon God they made.
                         Fa      Do
And the sign flashed out its warning,
                      Fa     Do
In the words that it was forming.
                       Fa
And the sign said, the words of the prophets
                           Do
Are written on the subway walls
             Do     Do/Si Lam
And tenement halls.
         Do           Sol         Lam
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.</pre>]
