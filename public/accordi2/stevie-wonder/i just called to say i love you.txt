     Do#

              Do#
No New Year`s day, to celebrate,
                                           Re#m
no chocolate covered candy hearts to give away.
Re#m7        Re#m    Re#m7       Re#m   Re#m7
  No first of spring... no song to sing,
               Re#m         Sol#4 Sol#  Do#
in fact here`s just another ordi__nary  day.
         Do#
No April rain, no flowers bloom,
                                        Re#m   Re#m7
no wedding Saturday within the month of June.
            Re#m Re#m7         Re#m   Re#m7
But what it is.... is something true,
           Re#m                   Sol#4  Sol#   Do#
made up of these three words that I must say to you.

       Fa#       Sol#  Do#
I just called to say I love you,
       Re#m7     Sol#           La#m7
I just called to say how much I care.
       Re#m7     Sol#  Re#m7
I just called to say I love you,
      Re#m             Sol#4  Sol#  Do#
and I mean it from the bottom of my heart.

            Do#
No summer`s high, no warm July,
                                           Re#m
no harvest moon to light one tender August night.
Re#m7      Re#m    Re#m7       Re#m    Re#m7
  No autumn breeze... no falling leaves,
         Re#m              Sol#4  Sol#     Do#
not even time for birds to fly to southern skies.
         Do#
No Libra Sun, no Halloween,
                                              Re#m
no giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring.
Re#m7        Re#m  Re#m7           Re#m   Re#m7
  But what it is..... though old, so new.
             Re#m                Sol#4       Sol#  Do#
to fill your heart like no three words could ever  do.
