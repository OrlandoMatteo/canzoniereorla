Isn't she lovely? Isn't she wonder-ful?
          Do#m7      Fa#9          La/Si   Mi
Isn't she precious?  Less than one minute old.

I never thought through love we'd be,
       Do#m7             Fa#13
Making one as lovely as she.
              La/Si               Mi
But isn't she lovely; made from love?



          Do#m7    Fa#9        La/Si     Mi
Isn't she pretty?  Truly the angel's best.
            Do#m7  Fa#9           La/Si    Mi
Boy, I'm so happy, we have been Heaven blessed.

I can't be-lieve what God has done;
            Do#m7               Fa#13
Through us, He's given life to one.
              La/Si               Mi
But isn't she lovely; made from love?

Isn't she lovely? Life and love are the same.
          Do#m7  Fa#9          La/Si    Mi
Life is A-isha;  the meaning of her name.

Londie, it could have not been done,
        Do#m7                  Fa#13
Without you who conceived the one,
               La/Si               Mi
That's so very lovely; made from love.
