Very superstitious, writing's on the wall

Very superstitious, ladder's 'bout to fall

Thirteen month old baby, broke the looking glass

Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past!

When you believe in things...
            La#7       La7b5         Sol#7sus4
...That you don't understand then you suffer,

  ...Superstition ain't the way! Yeh-e-yeh!

Ooh.., very superstitious, wash your face and hands

Rid me of the problem, do all that you can

Keep me in a daydream, keep me going strong

You don't wanna save me, sad is my song!

Very superstitious, nothing more to say

Very superstitious, The Devil's on his way
