I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
           Re                             
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
               Re                           
And I'm not proud of my address - in the torn up town
             
No postcode envy


                        Re
But every song's like: gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom

Blood stains, ballgowns, trashin' the hotel room
Do                                 Sol
We don't care - we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
                                Re
But everybody's like Cristal, Mayback, diamonds on your timepiece

Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
Do                             Sol
We don't care - we  aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals - It don't run in our blood
                 Do
That kind of lux just ain't for us
                 Sol
We crave a different kind of buzz
                      Re
Let me be your ruler - you can call me Queen Bee
                  Do
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule

My friends and I we've cracked the code
              Re                                      
We count our dollars on the train to the party
       Re                                      
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this
                    
We didn't come from money

We're bigger than we ever dreamed

And I'm in love with being queen (king)
