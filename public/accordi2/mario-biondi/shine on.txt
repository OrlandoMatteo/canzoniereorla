No need to let over the rainbow
             Lam9
cause you ve got sun
     Solmaj9  Fa6
in your soul
    Lam9
And when you smile
               Solmaj9   Mim7
it's sunny all over
       Lam9            Solmaj9  Mi7b9
as the clouds go rolling on

Hey, i know it seems some times
                      Sim7b5
despites it's hard to find
                       Mi7#9
when trouble keeps you to the shadows
Famaj7
I really have to say
                      Sim7b5
that troubles seem to fade
                 Mi7#9         Lam9
when i'm in your arms my darling

                                     Solmaj9  Lam9
We shine so much for us to see, it's true
                                              Solmaj9
and nothing really means much more to me than you
             Lam9
so shine on, darling
   Solmaj9

Lam9                 Solmaj9
I just had to come and see you
        Lam9          Solmaj9  Mi7b9
just in case you didn't know
Lam9                    Solmaj9       Mim7
that i tell you how much i really feel you
        Lam9          Solmaj9  Mi7b9
my last chance before i go
