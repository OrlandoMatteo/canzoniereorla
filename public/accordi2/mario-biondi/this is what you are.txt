Famaj7
Take me up and let me down
Fa6
Hold me when I'm sad
Famaj7
Take my eyes to look around
Fa6                         La#maj7
Take my ears to listen to the stars
                 Famaj7  Fa6
This is what you are
Famaj7
Knock me down Knock me out
Fa6
Make me feel shy
    Famaj7
But when you hold me in your arms
Fa6                        La#maj7
I can just forget the tears I've cried

This is what you are
                 Famaj7  Fa6
This is what you are
Famaj7
Write your number on my wall
Fa6
It's all you gotta do
Famaj7
Carve your shadow on my soul even
Fa6                   La#maj7
when you break my heart in two
                 Famaj7  Fa6
This is what you are
