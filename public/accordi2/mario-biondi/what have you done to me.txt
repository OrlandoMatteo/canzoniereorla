Open all the door

Won't you give some more

Of your love to me

The time we spent before

Is not enough and I wont more

Give your love to me
    Rem7
I remember that
        Sol                Sol7+
Life without you is such a pain
         Mim7
And it's up to me
         Rem7        Sol7sus4
Like the chance to start again

        Rem7       Sol7add6
I don't know, oooo baby I don't know

            Domaj7       La#6  Domaj7
What you've done to me

Domaj7
What you've done to me

Petals on the floor

Candles I adore

You feel so good to me

Like waves upon the shore

Keep coming back for more

You give good love to me
         Rem7
When I'm looking back
            Sol            Sol7+
I know this love was not a game
      Mim7
Need you close to me
         Rem7             Fa6/Sol
Like the desert needs the rain

        Rem7       Sol7add6
I don't know, oooo baby I don't know

What you've done to me

What you've done to me

Rem7  Sol7add6  Domaj7  La#6

Rem7  Sol7add6  Domaj7  La#6

Parlato:

A love so strong yet I feel that

The best is still to come

I can be myself when I am with you

Because you make me feel ooh baby

Like I have never felt before
