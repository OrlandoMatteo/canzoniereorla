There's nothing that I can do
            Lam7
I've set my mind on you
           Mim7
the more I see that you're not real
             Re
the more I believe I feel
        Domaj7
I gotta reach out to you
             Lam7
and hold you some day somehow
            Mim7
and when my love dreams come true
   Re
oh Lord
   Domaj7                     Lam7
No matter what it takes, to be here
   Mim7
no fear that can't be one by love
          Re
if you believe it

Domaj7
Love is a temple
Lam9
don't take it for granted
Mim7
and when it happens
     Re                        Domaj7
it's time to write your story

                 Domaj7
I tried to break all the rules
             Lam7
and all I do hurts you soon
             Mim7
but this time I'm close to you
          Re
girl, you slip away from me
     Domaj7                              Lam7
I'll never get the chance to get here
       Mim7
