       Lam  Do  Sol  Lam

    Lam
The pictures tell the story
     Do
This life had many shades
    Sol                         Lam
I'd wake up every morning and before I'd start each day

I'd take a drag from last nights cigarette
     Do
That smoldered in its tray
Sol                         Rem                Lam
Down a little something and then be on my way

  Lam
I traveled far and wide
              Do
And laid this head in many ports
      Sol
I was guided by a compass
      Lam
I saw beauty to the north

I drew the tales of many lives
             Do
And wore the faces of my own
            Sol
I had these memories all around me
     Rem
So I wouldn't be alone
Do
Some may be from showing up
Sol
Others are from growing up
Rem                              Lam
Sometimes I was so messed up and didn't have a clue
        Do
I ain't winning no one over
  Sol
I wear it just for you
              Rem
I've got your name written here

In a rose tattoo
     Lam

     Do
In a rose tattoo
              Rem
I've got your name written here
          Sol Lam     Lam  Do  Sol  Lam
In a rose tat-too

Lam
This ones for the mighty sea
Do
Mischief, gold and piracy
Sol
This ones for the man that raised me
Lam
Taught me sacrifice and bravery

This ones for our favorite game
Do
Black and gold, we wave the flag
Sol
This ones for my family name
     Rem
With pride I wear it to the grave
Do
Some may be from showing up
Sol
Others are from growing up
Rem                              Lam

In a rose tattoo

Fa
This one means the most to me
   Do
It stays here for eternity
  Sol
A ship that always stays the course
   Lam
An anchor for my every choice
  Fa
A rose that shines down from above
  Do
I signed and sealed these words in blood
  Sol
I heard them once, sung in a song

It played again and we sang along

Lam  Do  Sol Lam

       Lam
You'll always be here with me
Do
Even if you're gone
       Sol
You'll always have my love
    Rem
Our memory will live on
Do
