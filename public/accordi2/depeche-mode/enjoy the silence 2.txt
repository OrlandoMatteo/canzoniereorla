Dom
 Words like violence
Re#m
 Break the silence
Sol#
 Come crashing in

Into my little world
Dom
 Painful to me
Re#m
 Pierce right through me
Sol#
 Can't you understand

Oh my little girl

Fam
 All I ever wanted
Sol#
 All I ever needed
   Dom      La#4
Is here in my arms
Fam7          Sol#
Words are very unnecessary
Dom           Si
They can only do harm

Dom  Re#  Dom  Re#

Dom  Re#  Dom  Re#

Dom
 Vows are spoken
Re#m
 To be broken
Sol#
 Feelings are intense

Words are trivial
Dom
 Pleasures remain
Re#m
 So does the pain
Sol#
 Words are meaningless

And forgettable

Fam
 All I ever wanted
Sol#
 All I ever needed
   Dom      La#4
Is here in my arms
Fam7          Sol#
Words are very unnecessary
Dom           Si
They can only do harm
