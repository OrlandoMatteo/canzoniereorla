            Mim
There'll be times

When my crimes
     Do               Lam
Will seem almost unforgivable
       Mim
I give in to sin
            Do                     Re
Because you have to make this life livable
             Mim
But when you think I've had enough

From your sea of love
     Do                     Re
I'll take more than another riverful
    Mim          Re       Laadd9
And I'll make it all worthwhile
Do             Re
I'll make your heart smile

 Will you give it to me

Again and again

And will you return it

            Mim
There'll be days

When I stray
        Do
I may appear to be
        Re
Constantly out of reach
        Mim
I give in   to sin
          Do                 Re
Because I like to practice what I preach
        Mim
I'm not trying to say

I'll have it all my way
           Do
I'm always willing to learn
                Re
When you've got something to teach
    Mim          Re       Laadd9
And I'll make it all worthwhile
Do        Re
I'll make your heart smile
