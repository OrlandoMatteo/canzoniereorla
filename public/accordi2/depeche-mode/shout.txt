She was silent trying to be
                               Fa#
Like the girl who acted on the TV
Sol#m
Always knowing when to say
                             Fa#
Wishing for a moment so that they could see
Sol#m
Staring in the night
  Si
A picture in my room
      Do#
And I think that she knew her lines

             Fa#    Si Do#
Break away tonight
        Si         Fa#   Si Do#
I wanna hold your hand
             Si     Fa#   Si Do#
We've got to get it right
             Si   Fa#     Si Do#
We've got to understand

Sol#m
Carefully watching waiting as I
                                   Fa#
Stood upon the back streets and we start to play
Sol#m
I was screaming louder as the
                              Fa#
Curtains fall between us in a twisted way
Sol#m
Staring in the night
  Si
A picture in my room
      Do#
And I think that she knew her lines

             Fa#    Si Do#
Break away tonight
        Si         Fa#   Si Do#
I wanna hold your hand
             Si     Fa#   Si Do#
We've got to get it right
             Si   Fa#     Si Do#
We've got to understand

Sol#m
Placing all the questions in the
                            Fa#
Minutes of a game we won so long ago
Sol#m
Dangerous and beautiful the
                          Fa#
Radio transmission that I have to know
Sol#m
You could never run
Si
You could never stay
      Do#
And I think you belong to me

             Fa#    Si Do#
Break away tonight
        Si         Fa#   Si Do#
I wanna hold your hand
             Si     Fa#   Si Do#
We've got to get it right
             Si   Fa#     Si Do#
We've got to understand
             Fa#    Si Do#
Break away tonight
        Si         Fa#   Si Do#
I wanna hold your hand
             Si     Fa#   Si Do#
We've got to get it right
             Si   Fa#     Si Do#
We've got to understand

Sol#m
