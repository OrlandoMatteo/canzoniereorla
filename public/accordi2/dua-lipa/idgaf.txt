       Mim Re  Sol Do

Mim       Re            Sol
 You call me all friendly
           Do
Tellin' me how much you miss me
Mim        Re                 Sim      Do
 That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
    Mim          Re               Sol
Well, I'm too busy for your business
          Do
Go find a girl who wants to listen
Mim                 Re
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday
         Sim    Do
You have got me wrong
             Mim
So I cut you off
   Re
I don't need your love
Sol            Do
'Cause I already cried enough
          Mim
I've been done
    Re              Sim           Do
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
          Mim
I cut you off
  Re
I don't need your love,
Sol            Do
 so you can try all you want
Mim   Re               Sim        Do
 Your time is up, I'll tell you why
    Mim        Re
You say you're sorry
           Sol    Do
But it's too late now
   Mim      Re              Sim  Do
So save it, get gone, shut up
       Mim    Re             Sol       Do
'Cause if you think I care about you now
      Mim    Re           Sim  Do
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

Mim     Re
 I remember that weekend
Sol           Do
 When my best friend caught you creepin'
Mim      Re               Sim   Do
 You blamed it all on the alcohol
  Mim     Re
So I made my decision
Sol             Do
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Mim          Re
 Play the victim and switch your position
    Sim          Do
I'm through, I'm done
             Mim
So I cut you off
  Re
I don't need your love
Sol             Do
'Cause I already cried enough
          Mim
I've been done
     Re             Sim               Do
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
          Mim
I cut you off
  Re
I don't need your love,

No, I don't give a damn
Mim      Re                  Sim          Do
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
             Mim  Re
But I'm over you
           Sol        Do
Now you're all in the past
