Lam             Sol Fa    Sol
One, one, one...

Lam
Talkin' in my sleep at night

Makin' myself crazy
Fa
 (Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Lam
Wrote it down and read it out
                   Sol   Fa
Hopin' it would save me

(Too many times, too many times)
Lam                            Sol     Fa
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else

Nobody else
Sol    Lam                       Sol           Fa
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself
               Sol
I tell myself

Lam
One, don't pick up the phone
                                                  Sol
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Fa
Two, don't let him in

You'll have to kick him out again
Lam
Three, don't be his friend
                                                Sol  Famaj7
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
                                           Sol    Lam
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
                   Sol       Famaj7
I got new rules, I count 'em
                        Lam
I gotta tell them to myself
                           Famaj7
I got new rules, I count 'em

I gotta tell them to myself

Lam                                               Sol   Fa
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards

(Nowhere to turn) no way
                   Sol
(Nowhere to turn) no
Lam                                                Sol   Fa
Now I'm standing back from it, I finally see the pattern

(I never learn, I never learn)
Sol    Lam                       Sol           Famaj7
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself

I tell myself
              Sol
I do, I do, I do

Lam
One, don't pick up the phone
                                                  Sol
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Fa
Two, don't let him in

You'll have to kick him out again
Lam
Three, don't be his friend
                                                Sol  Famaj7
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
                                           Sol    Lam
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
                   Sol       Famaj7
I got new rules, I count 'em
                        Lam
I gotta tell them to myself
                           Famaj7
I got new rules, I count 'em
               Sol
I gotta tell them to myself

Lam
Practice makes perfect
                 Sol         Famaj7
I'm still tryna learn it by heart

(I got new rules, I count 'em)
Lam
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
                     Sol       Famaj7
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I

(I got new, I got new, I...)

Lam
One, don't pick up the phone
                                                  Sol
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Fa
Two, don't let him in

You'll have to kick him out again
Lam
Three, don't be his friend
                                                Sol  Famaj7
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
                                           Sol    Lam
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
                   Sol       Famaj7
I got new rules, I count 'em
                        Lam
I gotta tell them to myself
                           Famaj7
I got new rules, I count 'em
                 Sol
I gotta tell them to myself
      Lam
Don't let him in, don't let him in

Don't, don't, don't, don't
         Famaj7
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend

Don't, don't, don't, don't
      Lam
Don't let him in, don't let him in

Don't, don't, don't, don't
         Famaj7
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend

Don't, don't, don't, don't

You gettin' over him
