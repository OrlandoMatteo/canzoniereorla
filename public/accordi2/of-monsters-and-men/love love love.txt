Mim          Re/Fa#     Sol                        Mim
 Well, maybe I'm a crook for stealing your heart away
            Re/Fa#     Sol
Yeah, maybe I'm a crook for not caring for it
Mim          Re/Fa#            Sol       Mim
 Yeah, maybe I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad person
Re/Fa#   Sol

 And these fingertips
Sol                          Mim
 Will never run through your skin
          Re/Fa#           Sol
And those bright blue eyes
                  Mim  Re/Fa#     Sol
Can only meet mine across the room filled
                    Mim     Re/Fa#        Sol
with people that are less important than you
           Do  Re            Sol
