[<pre>Lam                      Do
Jumping up and down the floor
   Do          Famaj7
My head is an animal
    Lam                    Do
And once there was an animal
Do                           Famaj7
It had a son that mowed the lawn
    Lam             Do
The son was an ok guy
Do                    Famaj7
They had a pet dragonfly
    Lam                 Do
The dragonfly it ran away
Do                                Famaj7
But it came back with a story to say


Lam  Do    Famaj7
Hey!
Lam  Do    Famaj7
Hey!


    Lam                   Do
Her dirty paws and furry coat
                        Famaj7
She ran down the forest slope
    Lam                  Do
The forest of talking trees
                                          Famaj7
They used to sing about the birds and the bees
    Lam                  Do
The bees had declared a war
                                   Famaj7
The sky wasn't big enough for them all
    Lam                         Do
The birds they got help from below
                                     Famaj7
From dirty paws and the creatures of snow

Hey!
Lam  Do    Famaj7
Hey!


    Lam                       Do
And for a while things were cold
                               Famaj7
They were scared down in their holes
    Lam                   Do
The forest that once was green
                                     Famaj7
Was colored black by those killing machines
    Lam                   Do
But she and her furry friends
                                Famaj7
Took down the queen bee and her men
    Lam                    Do
And that's how the story goes
                                             Famaj7
The story of the beast with those four dirty paws
