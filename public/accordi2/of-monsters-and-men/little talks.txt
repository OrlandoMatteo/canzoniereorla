                 Hey!
Lam   Famaj7   Do   Sol
                 Hey!
Lam   Famaj7   Do   Sol
                 Hey!
Lam   Famaj7   Do   Sol


Lam               Famaj7           Do
I don't like walking around this old and empty house
    Lam                 Fa                Do
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear
     Lam           Famaj7           Do
The stairs creak as I sleep, it's keeping me awake
          Lam            Fa                 Do
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
Lam          Famaj7      Do
Some days I can't even dress myself
       Lam           Fa            Do
It's killing me to see you this way


                   Lam       Famaj7
'Cause though the truth may vary
    Do           Sol
This ship will carry
      Lam    Fa        Do
Our bodies safe to shore


Lam   Famaj7   Do   Sol
                 Hey!
Lam   Famaj7   Do   Sol
                 Hey!
Lam   Famaj7   Do   Sol
                 Hey!
Lam   Famaj7   Do   Sol


            Lam       Famaj7            Do
There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
Lam              Famaj7           Do
Tell her that I miss our little talks
Lam              Famaj7    Do
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
    Lam             Famaj7               Do
We used to play outside when we were young (and full of life and full of love)
Lam        Famaj7           Do
Some days I don't know if I am wrong or right
      Lam             Famaj7             Do
Your mind is playing tricks on you my dear


                   Lam        Famaj7
'Cause though the truth may vary
    Do           Sol
This ship will carry
      Lam   Famaj7     Do     Sol
Our bodies safe to shore  Hey!
Lam                Famaj7  Do     Sol
Don't listen to a word I say. Hey!
Lam              Famaj7      Do     Sol
The screams all sound the same. Hey!
                   Lam       Famaj7

Lam
You're gone, gone, gone away. I watched you disappear
Lam
All that's left is a ghost of you
           Lam
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do. 
     Lam
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon.
    Lam          Famaj7       Do
Now wait, wait, wait for me. Please hang around
  Lam            Famaj7   Do      Sol
I see you when I fall asleep. Hey!
