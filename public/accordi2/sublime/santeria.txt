[<pre>Mi Sol# Do#m Si


             Mi                        Sol#          
I don't practice santeria I ain't got no crystal ball
     Do#m                            Si
I had a million dollars but I'd, I'd spend it all
     Mi                                 Sol#
If I could find that Heina and that Sancho she's found
            Do#m                      Si 
Well I'd pop a cap in Sancho and I'd   slap her down


La        Si             Mi   Do#m
All I really wanna know my baby
La        Si            Mi   Do#m      La
All I really wanna say I can't define
       Si            Mi    Do#m
It's love that I need 
La          Si
But my soul will have to


    Mi                           Sol#
Wait 'till I get back, find a Heina of my own
   Do#m                      Si
Daddy's gonna love one and all
Mi                                 Sol#
I feel the break, feel the break, feel the break
                  Do#m                  
And I gotta live it up Oh yeah, uh huh,
  Si 
well I swear that I


La        Si           Mi    Do#m
All I really wanna know my baby
La        Si            Mi   Do#m      La
All I really wanna say I can't define
      Si            Mi    Do#m
That love will make it go
La         Si
My soul will have to...


La        Si           Mi    Do#m
All I really wanna say my baby
La        Si            Mi   Do#m      La
All I really wanna say is I've got mine
     Si            Mi     Do#m
And I'll make it yes I'm comin' up
La         Si
Tell Sanchito that if


Mi                         Sol#
He knows what is good for him he best go run and hide
 Do#m              Si
Daddy's got a new 45
Mi                                   
And I won't think twice to stick that 
     Sol#
barrel straight down Sancho's throat
         Do#m                        
Believe me when I say that I've got
     Si 
something for his punk ass


La        Si           Mi    Do#m
Well I really wanna know my baby
La        Si            Mi   Do#m      La
What I really wanna say is there's just one way back
  Si           Mi     Do#m
And I'll make it
La           Si
yeah my soul will have to wait</pre>]
