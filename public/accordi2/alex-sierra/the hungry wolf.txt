[<pre>                                              Do  Si
I am a hungry wolf and run endlessly with my mate

Si                            Do   Si    Do   Si
I see the gutter fed in the foolish, outrun and kill the strong

    Re                                   Mi
At daybreak I run, awake to who follows me

               
I roam, I roam

                                               Do  Si
I am a hungry wolf, and run endlessly with my mate

           Do    Si             Do   Si  
Welcome to dripping jaws, the altar of your death

   Re                                    Mi
At daybreak I run, ready to tear up the world

               
I roam, I roam


     Mi               Do
The hungry wolf, she stares from the hill

    Mi                     Do   Si   Do   Si 
At villagers around the fire

Sol                      Si
She loves her mate, as he loves her

          Mi                    
And they live together for life

                                                Do  Si
I am a hungry wolf, and I run endlesly with my mate

                Do   Si
Look across the street, my friend

      Do    Si
We're waiting for you to slow down

    Re                                      Mi
At daybreak I roam, eyes in the back of my head

               
I roam, I roam</pre>]
