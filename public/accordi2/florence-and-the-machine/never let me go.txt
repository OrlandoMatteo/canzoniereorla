Re                     La
 Looking up from underneath
                            Fa#m
Fractured moonlight on the sea
                                    Mi
Reflections still look the same to me
                        Re
As before I went under
                          La
And it's peaceful in the deep
                           Fa#m
Cathedral where you cannot breathe
                           Mi
No need to pray, no need to speak
             Re
Now I am under all
                       Fa#m
And it's breaking over me
                                 Mi
A thousand miles down to the sea bed
                           Re
Found the place to rest my head

Never let me go ...Never let me go

        La          Mi        Fa#m     Re
And the arms of the ocean are carrying me
    La         Mi         Fa#m           Re
And all this devotion was rushing out of me
        Fa#m        Mi           Fa#m        Re
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner like me
        La          Mi      Fa#m        Mi
But the arms of the ocean delivered me

Re                               La
 Though the pressure's hard to take
                           Fa#m
It's the only way I can escape
                            Mi
It seems a heavy choice to make
                       Re

And it's over
        Fa#m     Mi
And I'm  going under
            Do#m     Re
But I'm not giving up
       Fa#m     Mi
I'm just giving in
Do#m Re  Fa#m          Mi
I'm   ...slipping underneath
Do#m Re     Fa#m       Mi
So    ...so cold and so sweet
