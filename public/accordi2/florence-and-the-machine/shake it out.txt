 Regrets collect like old friends
                            La#
Here to relive your darkest moments
                                   Fa
I can see no way, I can see no way

And all of the ghouls come out to play
Rem         La#                      Fa
 And every demon wants his pound of flesh
               Do                    Rem
But I like to keep some things to myself
              La#               Solm
I like to keep my issues drawn
            La#                Fa
It's always darkest before the dawn

And I've been a fool and I've been blind
                             La#
I can never leave the past behind
                                   Fa
I can see no way, I can see no way
                                 Rem
I'm always dragging that horse around
           La#                        Fa
All of his questions, such a mournful sound
                  Do                     Rem
Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
              La#            Solm
So I like to keep my issues drawn
                 La#               Fa
But it's always darkest before the dawn


Shake it out, shake it out,

shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa

Shake it out, shake it out,
                                     La#
shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa

And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
    Solm      Fa
So shake him off, oh whoa

Rem        La#                   Fa
 And I am done with my graceless heart
                     Do                     Rem
So tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart
                 La#            Solm
'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
            La#                Fa
It's always darkest before the dawn


Shake it out, shake it out,

shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa

Shake it out, shake it out,
                                     La#
shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa

And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
    Solm      Fa
So shake him off, oh whoa
Rem                            La#
 And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
Fa                                 Do
 And given half the chance would I take any of it back
Rem                           La#
 It's a fine romance but it's left me so undone
Solm         La#                Fa
 It's always darkest before the dawn

Oh whoa, oh whoa...

Solm7
 And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
Rem                                    Do
So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my road
Solm7
And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope
Rem                            Do
 It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat
       La#                                       Do
'Cause looking for heaven, found the devil in me
Rem                           Do
Looking for heaven, found the devil in me
     Solm7                    Lam7  La#
Well what the hell I'm gonna let it happen to me, yeah

Fa
 Shake it out, shake it out,

shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa

Shake it out, shake it out,
                                     La#
shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa

And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
    Solm      Fa
So shake him off, oh whoa

Shake it out, shake it out,

shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa

Shake it out, shake it out,
                                     La#
shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa

And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
    Solm      Fa
So shake him off, oh whoa

Fa    La#    Solm Fa
