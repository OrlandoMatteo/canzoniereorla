[<pre>            Do
I was on a heavy tip
Lam                           Sim
Tryna cross a canyon with a broken limb
                 Do
You were on the other side
      Lam                       Sim
Like always, wondering what to do with life
           Do
I already had a sip
        Lam                             Sim
So I'd reasoned I was drunk enough to deal with it
                 Do
You were on the other side
      Lam                     Sim
Like always, you could never make your mind
Do      Lam       Mim    Re
  And with one kiss
Do        Lam       Mim        Re
  You inspired a fire of devotion
         Do      Lam      Mim  Re
That lasted for 20 years
Do              Lam   Mim 
  What kind of man loves like this
Do Lam Sim Re
Do Lam Sim Mim    (power chords)
(x2)
Do Lam Sim Re       
Do     Lam        Sim       Mim
  To let me dangle at a cruel angle
Do        Lam                   Sim    Re
  Oh my feet don't touch the floor
Do      Lam               Sim      Mim
  Sometimes you're half in and then you're half out
Do      Lam              Sim   Re
  But never close the door
Do              Lam    Sim        Mim
  What kind of man loves like this
Do              Lam   Sim  Re
  What kind of man
Do              Lam    Sim        Mim
  What kind of man loves like this
Do              Lam   Sim  Re
  What kind of man
G                   Mim 
  You're a holy fool all coloured blue
Sim
  Red feet upon the floor
G                   Mim
  You do such damage, how do you manage?
Sim
  Tryna crawl in back for more
Do      Lam       Mim    Re
  And with one kiss
Do        Lam       Mim        Re
  You inspired a fire of devotion
Do                 Lam      Mim  Re
  That lasted for 20 years
Do              Lam   Mim 
  What kind of man loves like this
Do              Lam    Sim        Mim
  What kind of man loves like this
Do              Lam   Sim  Re
  What kind of man
Do              Lam    Sim        Mim
  What kind of man loves like this
Do              Lam   Sim  Re
  What kind of man
Do     Lam             Sim       Mim
  But I can't beat you cause I'm still with you
Do    Lam         Sim    Re
  Oh mercy I implore
Do     Lam        Sim     Mim
  How do you do it? I think I'm through it
Do          Lam                Sim   Re
  Then I'm back against the wall
Do              Lam    Sim        Mim
  What kind of man loves like this
Do              Lam   Sim  Re
  What kind of man
Do              Lam    Sim        Mim
  What kind of man loves like this
Do              Lam   Sim  Re
  What kind of man
Do              Lam    Sim        Mim
  What kind of man loves like this
Do              Lam   Sim  Re
  What kind of man
Do              Lam    Sim        Mim
  What kind of man loves like this
Do              Lam   Sim  Re
  What kind of man
Mim
