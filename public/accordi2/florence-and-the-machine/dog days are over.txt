Sol                                       Lam  Mim7
 Happiness hit her like a train on a tra--------ck
Sol                                          Lam  Mim 7
 Coming towards her stuck still no turning ba-------ck
    Sol
She hid it 'round corners and she hid it under beds
                   Lam           Mim7
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
     Sol
With every bubble she sank with her drink
                Lam         Mim7
And washed it away down the kitchen sink

    Sol
The dog days are over

The dog days are done
               Lam
The horses are coming
   Mim
So you better run

    Sol
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father

Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
                             Lam
Leave all your love and your longing behind
          Mim
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive

    Sol
The dog days are over

The dog days are done
                  Lam
Can you hear the horses?
       Mim            Sol
'Cause here they come

    Sol                     Lam      Mim7
And I never wanted anything from you
       Sol                                  Lam        Mim7
Except everything you had and what was left after that too, oh

Sol                                        Lam  Mim7
 Happiness hit her like a bullet in the back
Sol
 Struck from a great height
                              Lam      Mim7
by someone who should know better than that

Sol
The dog days are over

The dog days are done

       Mim               Sol
'Cause here they come

    Sol
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father

Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
                             Lam
Leave all your love and your longing behind
          Mim
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
