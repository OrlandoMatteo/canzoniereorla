 I would say I'm sorry
      Do#m                   Re
 If I thought that it would change your mind
  La             Sim
 But I know that this time
        Do#m                Re
 I have said too much, been too unkind

Do#m       Sim            Do#m                 Sim
  I try to laugh about it cover it all up with lies
Do#m       Sim            Do#m                   Sim
  I try to laugh about it hiding the tears in my eyes

 'Cause boys  don't cry
  La   Sim    Do#m  Re   Do#m Sim
  Boys  don't cry

La                  Sim
 I would break down at your feet
     Do#m            Re
 And beg forgiveness plead with you
 La              Sim
 But I know that it's too late
     Do#m                Re
 And now there's nothing I can do
Do#m          Sim             Do#m                 Sim
  So I try to laugh about it, cover it all up with lies

 I would tell you that I loved you
 Do#m              Re
 If I thought that you would stay
 La              Sim
 But I know that it's no use
     Do#m           Re
 And you're already gone away
Mi              Fa#m7
 Misjudged your limits
Mi              Fa#m7
 Pushed you too far
Mi            Fa#m7
 Took you for granted
   Re                         Mi
 I thought that you needed me more more more

     La              Sim
 Now I would do most anything
    Do#m               Re
 To get you back by my side
 La         Sim
 But I just keep on laughing
