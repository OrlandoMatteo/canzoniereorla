I’ve been looking so long at these pictures of you
       La                           Re
that I almost believe that they’re real

I’ve been living so long with my pictures of you
       La                Re
that I almost believe that the pictures are all

Remembering you standing quiet in the rain
     La                      Re
as I ran to your heart to be near
       La                        Re
and we kissed as the sky fell in holding close
      La                        Re
how I always held close in your fear
  La                    Re
remembering you running soft through the night
         La                      Re
you were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
    La                           Re
and screamed at the make-believe screamed at the sky
        La                     Re              La  Re
and you finally found all your courage to let it all go

  La         Re
remembering you fallen into my arms
La                            Re
crying for the death of your heart
         La                      Re
you were stone white so delicate lost in the cold
         La                    Re
you were always so lost in the dark
  La                Re
remembering you how you used to be
     La                         Re
slow drowned you were angels so much more than everything
   La                           Re
oh hold for the last time then  slip away quietly
La                 Re
open my eyes but I never see anything

   Mi             Re
If only I’d thought of the right words
  Mi                        Re
I could have held onto your heart
   Mi                       Re
if only I’d thought of the right words
  Mi   Re             La  Re
I wouldn’t be breaking apart all my pictures of you

always just breaking apart my pictures of you
