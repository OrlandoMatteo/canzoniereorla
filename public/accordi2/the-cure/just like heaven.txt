 La               Mi
"Show me how you do that trick
    Sim              Re
The one that makes me scream" she said
     La                 Mi
"The one that makes me laugh" she said
    Sim            Re
And threw her arms around my neck
 La               Mi
"Show me how you do it
      Sim          Re
And I promise you I promise that
           La                Mi
I'll run away with you
          Sim              Re
I'll run away with you"


La Mi Sim Re (2x)


La                Mi 
Spinning on that dizzy edge
  Sim                Re
I kissed her face and kissed her head
    La                   Mi               Sim
And dreamed of all the different ways I had
            Re
To make her glow
La               Mi               Sim
"Why are you so far away?" she said
               Re                     La            Mi
"Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you
            Sim           Re
That I'm in love with you"


Fa#m
You
Sol
Soft and only
Fa#m
You
Sol
Lost and lonely
Fa#m
You
Sol
Strange as angels
Re
Dancing in the deepest oceans

Twisting in the water

You're just like a dream


La Mi Sim Re (2x)


La                  Mi
Daylight licked me into shape
  Sim             Re
I must have been asleep for days
    La              Mi
And moving lips to breathe her name
  Sim         Re
I opened up my eyes
    La             Mi
And found myself alone alone
 Sim         Re
Alone above a raging sea
     La              Mi
That stole the only girl I loved
    Sim               Re
And drowned her deep inside of me

You
Sol                 Re
Just like heaven</pre>]
