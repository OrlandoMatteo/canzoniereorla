Re              Sol
I don't care if Monday's blue
Re                 La
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Sim              Sol
Thursday I don't care about you
     Re            La
It's Friday I'm in love
Re             Sol
Monday you can fall apart
Re                 La
Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart
Sim              Sol
Thursday doesn't even start
     Re            La
It's Friday I'm in love
Sol      La
Saturday wait
    Sim           Sol
And Sunday always comes too late
    Re           La
But Friday never hesitate...
Re              Sol
I don't care if Monday's black
Re                 La
Tuesday, Wednesday heart attack
Sim            Sol
Thursday never looking back
     Re            La
It's Friday I'm in love

Re             Sol
Monday you can hold your head
Re                 La
Tuesday, Wednesday stay in bed
   Sim                Sol
Or Thursday watch the walls instead
     Re            La
It's Friday I'm in love
Sol      La
Saturday wait
    Sim           Sol
And Sunday always comes too late

  Dressed up to the eyes
                    Re
It's a wonderful surprise
            La                     Sim
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
                  Doadd9
Throwing out your frown
                        Re
And just smiling at the sound
                  La
And as sleek as a shriek
                   Sim
Spinning round and round
                  Doadd9
Always take a big bite
                     Re
It's such a gorgeous sight
           La                       Sim
To see you eat in the middle of the night
                   Doadd9
You can never get enough
                Re
Enough of this stuff
            La
It's Friday I'm in love

Thursday I don't care about you
     Re             La
It's Friday, I'm in love
Re             Sol
Monday you can fall apart
Re                 La
