Si                     Rem7
 I've waited hours for this
Si                   Do#m
 I've made myself so sick
  Sol#m
I wish I'd stayed
 Fa#         Mi
asleep today
Si                   Re#m7        Si
I never thought this day would end
                  Do#m        Sol#m
I never thought tonight could ever be
     Fa#          Mi
this close to me

Si                      Re#m7  Si
 Just try to see in the dark
                    Do#m
just try to make it work
   Sol#m           Fa#               Mi
to feel the fear before you're here
Si                     Re#m7     Si
I make the shapes come much too close

I pull my eyes out
Do#m    Sol#m             Fa#
hold my breath and wait until I shake...

Mi                 Do#m7  Mi
 But if I had your faith
                     Fa#      Si
then I could make it safe and clean
Mi             Do#m7  Mi
 If only I was sure
                    Fa#        Si
that my head on the door was a dream
