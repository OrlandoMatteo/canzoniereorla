I don't care if Monday's blue
Re                  La 
Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too
Sim             Sol
Thursday I don't care about you
     Re             La 
It's Friday I'm in love


Re              Sol 
Monday you can fall apart
Re                 La
Tuesday Wednesday break my heart
Sim             Sol
Thursday doesn't even start
     Re             La 
It's Friday I'm in love


Sol        La
Saturday wait
Sim              Sol 
And Sunday always comes too late
    Re            La 
But Friday never hesitate...

Monday you can hold your head
Re                 La
Tuesday Wednesday stay in bed
   Sim               Sol 
Or Thursday watch the walls instead
Re                  La 
It's Friday I'm in love


Sol        La
Saturday wait

Dressed up to the eyes, it's a wonderful surprise
            La                       Sim
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
                   Do                             Re
Throwing out your frown and just smiling at the sound
                   La 
And as sleek as a shriek spinning round and round
Sim                Do                           Re
Always take a big bite, it's such a gorgeous sight
         La                          Sim 
To see you eat in the middle of the night
                    Do                    Re
You can never get enough, enough of this stuff
           La
It's Friday I'm in love
