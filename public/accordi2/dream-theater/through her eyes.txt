     Sol  Re/Fa#   Mim  Dosus2

Sol
  She never really had a chance
Re/Fa#
  On that fateful moonlit night
Mim
  Sacrificed without a fight
Dosus2
  A victim of her circumstance

Sol
  Now that I've become aware
Re/Fa#
  And I've exposed this tragedy
Mim
  A sadness grows inside of me
Dosus2
  It all seems so unfair

Mim                         Re
  I'm learning all about my life
                       Sol
By looking through her eyes


     Sol  Re/Fa#   Mim  Dosus2

Sol
  Just beyond the churchyard gates
Re/Fa#
  Where the grass is overgrown
Mim
  I saw the writing on her stone
Dosus2
  I felt like I would suffocate

Sol
  In loving memory of our child
Re/Fa#
  So innocent, eyes open wide
Mim
  I felt so empty as I cried
Dosus2
  Like part of me had died

Mim                         Re
  I'm learning all about my life
                       Lam
By looking through her eyes
                   Dosus2
  And as her image wandered through my head
  Sol
I wept just like a baby
     Re
As I lay awake in bed
Lam
  And I know what it's like
   Dosus2
To lose someone you love
    Mim                Re
And this felt just the same

Sol
  She wasn't given any choice
Re/Fa#
  Desperation stole her voice
Mim
  I've been given so much more in life
Dosus2
  I've got a son, I've got a wife

Sol
  I had to suffer one last time
Re/Fa#
  To grieve for her and say goodbye
Mim
  Relive the anguish of my past
Dosus2
  To find out who I was at last

Mim                   Re
  The door has opened wide
                       Do
  I'm turning with the tide
Lam                 Sol
Looking through her eyes


     Sol  Re/Fa#   Mim  Dosus2
