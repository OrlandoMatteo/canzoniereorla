Do#m               Si/Do#
   It doesn't make any sense
Sol#m/Do#      La/Do#
   This tragic ending
Do#m               Si/Do#
   In spite of the evidence
        Sol#m/Do#       La/Do#
There's something still missing
Do#m               Si/Do#
 Heard some of the rumors told
Sol#m       La/Do#
 A taste of one's wealth
Do#m          Si/Do#
 Did Victoria wound his soul?
Sol#m            La/Do#
Did she bid him farewell?

         Do#m  Si
One last time
          Sol#m7  La
We'll lay down  today
         Do#m  Si
One last time
         Sol#m7 La
Until we fade  away
         Do#m  Si
One last time
          Sol#m7  La
We'll lay down  today
         Do#m   Si/Re#
One last time
          Sol#m La      Fa#7sus4
We slowly fade away... away

Laadd9                    Siadd9
     Here I am inside his  home
Laadd9                          Fa#
     It holds the many clues to my suspicions
Laadd9                             Siadd9
     And as I'm standing here right  now
         Doadd9              Re
     I'm finally shown what I have always known
Laadd9                    Siadd9
    Coincidence I can't believe
      Fa#m             Mi          Re     Mi
As my childhood dreams slowly come true

Sol                  La
  Are these her memories
                    Sim
Awakened through my eyes
               Sol#m7b5
This house has brought back to life

Fa    Sol/Fa
      An open door

Sol#               La#/Sol#
I walk on through into this outro
Dom          Dom/La#
  Feeling as cold as outside
    Fam                     Sol#/Re#
The walls disappear to some woman who's screaming
Rem7b5
A man pleads forgiveness
    Do#            Doadd9    Dom
His words I cannot hear
