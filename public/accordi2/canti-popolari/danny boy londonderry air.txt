[<pre>   Do   Fa
Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
                      Do               Sol
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side
   Do   Fa
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling
   Do        Sol        Do
'Tis you must go, 'tis you must go and I must bide

        Do              Fa                Do
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
       Lam        Fa     Sol
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
            Do             Fa          Do      Lam
'Tis I'll be there in sunshine or in shadow
             Do              Sol          Do
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so

But if you come, and all the flowers are dying
If I am dead, as dead I may well be
You'll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an "Ave" there for me

And I shall hear, tho' soft you tread above me
And all my grave shall warm and sweeter be
If you will bend and tell me that you love me
Then I will sleep in peace until you come to me</pre>]
