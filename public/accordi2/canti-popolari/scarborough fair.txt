Mim              Re          Mim
Are you going to Scarborough Fair
Sol        Mim       La       Mim
  Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
  Mim    Sol                 Re
Remember me to one who lives there
Mim      Re    Sim          Mim
She once was a true love of mine

Mim                   Re      Mim
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
(On the side of a hill in the deep forest green) 
Sol        Mim       La       Mim
  Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
(Tracing of sparrow on snowcrested brown)
    Mim    Sol              Re
Without no seams nor needle work
(Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain)
Mim         Re   Sim          Mim
Then she'll be a true love of mine
(Sleeps unaware of the clarion call)

Mim                    Re      Mim
Tell her to find me an acre of land
(On the side of a hill a sprinkling of leaves)
Sol        Mim       La       Mim
  Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
(Washes the grave with silvery tears)
   Mim           Sol               Re
Between the salt water and the sea strands
(A soldier cleans and polishes a gun)
Mim         Re   Sim          Mim
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Mim                        Re        Mim
Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
(War bellows blazing in scarlet battalions)
Sol        Mim       La       Mim
  Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
(Generals order their soldiers to kill)
    Mim       Sol              Re
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
(And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten)
Mim         Re   Sim          Mim
Then she'll be a true love of mine

Mim              Re          Mim
Are you going to Scarborough Fair
Sol        Mim       La       Mim
  Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
  Mim    Sol                 Re
Remember me to one who lives there
Mim      Re    Sim          Mim
She once was a true love of mine
