Re
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
        Sim
But the very next day you gave it away
Mim
This year to save me from tears
     La
I'll give it to someone special

 Once bitten and twice shy
Sim                                        [ Mim ]
 I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Mim
 Tell me baby do you recognize me?
La
 Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me


Re
 "Merry Christmas!" I wrapped it up and sent it
 (whispered) 
Sim
With a note saying: "I love you!", I meant it
Mim
Now I know what a fool I've been
           La
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

Re
 Crowded room, friends with tired eyes
Sim
 Hiding from you and your soul of ice
Mim
 My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
La
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
  Sim                                    [ Mim ]
A man undercover but you tore him apart
                        (To-o-ore   me  apa-art)
Mim
    Ooh-hoo 
         La
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again
