 Somebody told me
     Sim7
Boy, everything she wants
   Mi                  Fa#
Is everything she sees

I guess I must have loved you
          Sim7                           Mi
Because I said you were the perfect girl for me, baby
Fa#
 And now we're six months older
    Sim7
And everything you want
    Mi9                 Fa#
And everything you see

Is out of reach not good enough
  Sim7                         Mi9
I don't know what the hell you want from me
  Fa#
Oh

 Some people work for a living

Some people work for fun
      Mi9                 Fa#
Girl, I just work for you

They told me marriage was a give and take
             Sim7
Well, you've shown me you can take
                Mi9           Fa#
You've got some giving to do

And now you tell me that you're having my baby
     Sim7                           Mi9
I'll tell you that I'm happy if you want me to
    Fa#
But one step further and my back will break
      Sim7
If my best isn't good enough
     Mi9                           Fa#
Then how can it be good enough for two

All the things we sign
