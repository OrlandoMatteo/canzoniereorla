Let me take you to the place
      Si
Where membership's a smiling face,
Fa#m7                     Si
 Brush shoulders with the stars
      Fa#m7
Where strangers take you by the hand,
    Si                     Fa#m7
And welcome you to wonderland
                        Si
From beneath their panamas...

Club Tropicana, drinks are free,
                 Re#m7                    Si
Fun and sunshine there's enough for everyone
                           Re#m7  Si
All that's missing is the sea,
                 Re#m7
But don't worry, you can suntan!

Castaways and Lovers meet,
     Si
Then kiss in Tropicana's heat,
Fa#m7                         Si
 Watch the waves break on the bay
Fa#m7
Soft white sands, a blue lagoon,
Si                          Fa#m7
Cocktail time, a summer's tune,
                    Si
A whole night's holiday!
