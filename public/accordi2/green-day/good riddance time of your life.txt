Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road,

Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go
Mim          Re            Do                 Sol
So make the best of this test and don't ask why
Mim         Re              Do                 Sol
It's not a question but a lesson learned in time


Mim                     Sol           Mim           Sol
It's something unpredictable but in the end it's right
Mim                 Re            Sol
I hope you had the time of your life.

So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
Sol                      Doadd9                Re
Hang it on a shelf, in good health and good time
Mim          Re             Do            Sol
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
Mim            Re            Do             Sol
For what it's worth it was worth all the while


Mim                     Sol           Mim           Sol
It's something unpredictable but in the end it's right
Mim                 Re            Sol
I hope you had the time of your life.
