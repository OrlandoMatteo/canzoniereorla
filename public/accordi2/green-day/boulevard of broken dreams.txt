[<pre>Mim        Sol                Re             La              Mim
 I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known
           Sol              Re                La               Mim
Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone


(Mim) Sol  Re  La


Mim           Sol             Re            La              Mim
 I walk this empty street, on the boulevard of broken dreams
          Sol                Re             La               Mim
Where the city sleeps, and I'm the only one and I walk alone



(Mim) Sol  Re           La             Mim
           I walk alone, I walk alone
(Mim) Sol  Re           La
           I walk alone, I walk a....


Do       Sol            Re              Mim
    My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
Do        Sol       Re               Mim
    My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Do        Sol       Re                 Mim
    Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Do         Sol      Si7
    Till then I walk alone


 Mim    Sol     Re       La
Ah-Ah Ah-Ah Ah-Ah   Ahhh-Ah
     Mim   Sol     Re       La
haaa-ah  Ah-Ah Ah-Ah   Ah-Ah



Mim           Sol
 I'm walking down the line
Re               La               Mim
That divides me somewhere in my mind
       Sol           Re
On the border line of the edge
    La              Mim
And where I walk alone


(Mim) Sol  Re  La


Mim      Sol
 Read between the lines
Re                    La              Mim
What's fucked up and everything's alright
         Sol               Re               La
Check my vital signs, to know I'm still alive
             Mim
And I walk alone



(Mim) Sol  Re           La             Mim
           I walk alone, I walk alone
(Mim) Sol  Re           La
           I walk alone, I walk a....
