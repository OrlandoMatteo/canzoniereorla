Do        Fa       Sol Fa
I want to be the minority
Do      Fa          Sol  Fa
I don't need your authority
Do            Fa      Sol Fa
Down with the moral majority
       Do        Fa       Sol Fa
'Cause I want to be the minority

  Do       Sol      Fa          Do
I pledge allegiance to the underworld
    Do           Sol          Fa             Sol
One nation under dog there of which I stand alone
  Do          Sol     Fa                Do
A face in the crowd unsung, against the mold
    Do           Sol              Fa         Do
Without a doubt, singled out, the only way I know

Do        Fa       Sol Fa
I want to be the minority
Do      Fa          Sol  Fa
I don't need your authority
Do            Fa      Sol Fa
Down with the moral majority
       Do        Fa       Sol Fa
'Cause I want to be the minority

Lam         Mim    Fa   Do
Stepped out of the line
Lam          Mim   Fa      Sol
Like a sheep runs from the herd
Lam        Mim  Fa   Do
Marching out of time
Lam            Fa         Sol7
To my own beat now... The only way I know

    Do         Sol   Fa              Do
One light, one mind, flashing in the dark
Do             Sol          Fa              Sol
Blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts
    Do         Sol   Fa                Do
For crying out loud, she screamed unto me
  Do            Sol            Fa               Do
A free for all, fuck them all, you are your own sight

Do        Fa       Sol Fa
I want to be the minority
Do      Fa          Sol  Fa
I don't need your authority
Do            Fa      Sol Fa
Down with the moral majority
