Re#             La#
Do you have the time
   Dom          Solm
To listen to me whine
 Sol#              Re#
About nothing and everything
    La#
All at once

Re#         La#
I am one of those
  Dom        Solm
Melodramatic fools
   Sol#          Re#
Neurotic to the bone
          La#
No doubt about it

Sol#          La#             Re#
 Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sol#           La#               Re#
 Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
   Sol#              La#
It all keeps adding up
  Re#       Do#      Dom
I think I'm cracking up
   Sol#        La#
Am I just paranoid?
          Re#  La#  Dom  La#  Re#  La#  Dom  La#
Am I just stoned?

  Re#       La#
I went to a shrink
   Dom        Solm
To analyze my dreams
    Sol#               Re#
She says it's lack of sex
                La#
That's bringing me down

  Re#       La#
I went to a whore
    Dom              Solm
She said my life's a bore
   Sol#             Re#
So quit my whining cause
              La#
It's bringing her down
