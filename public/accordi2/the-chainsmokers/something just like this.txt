             La            Sol          La           Sim
I've been reading books of old, the legends and the myths
     La           Sol          La           Sim
Achilles and his gold, Hercules and his gifts
   La           Sol           La            Sim     
Spiderman's control and Batman with his fists
La           Sol                  La         Sim         
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list


                  La           Sol           La       Sim
But she said, where'd you wanna go, how much you wanna risk?
           La            Sol                La        Sim
I'm not looking for somebody with some superhuman gifts
       La      Sol         La      Sim
Some superhero, some fairytale bliss
         La           Sol              La        Sim
Just something I can turn to, somebody I can kiss


           La           Sol                   La        Sim
I want something just like this, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
             La       Sol             La           Sim
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
             La              Sol              La       Sim
Oh I want something just like this, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo       
             La       Sol             La           Sim
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
          La              Sol     La  Sim   La  Sol  La  Sim
Oh I want something just like this
          La              Sol     La  Sim   La  Sol  La  Sim
I want something just like this

I've been reading books of old, the legends and the myths
       La            Sol              La        Sim
The testaments they told, the moon and its eclipse
      La        Sol             La         Sim    
And Superman unrolls, a suit before he lifts
La         Sol                  La           Sim
  But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

               La           Sol            La         Sim
She said, where'd you wanna go, how much you wanna risk?

       La      Sol         La      Sim
Some superhero, some fairytale bliss
         La           Sol              La        Sim
Just something I can turn to, somebody I can miss


       La              Sol     La  Sim   La  Sol  La  Sim
I want something just like this
       La              Sol     La  Sim   La  Sol  La  Sim
I want something just like this

       La       Sol             La              Sim
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-oo

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-oo
