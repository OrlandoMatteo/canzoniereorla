[<pre>Do Sol Lam Lam x2


Do              Sol
You shout it out
    Lam             
but I can't hear a word you say
Do               Sol              Lam   
I'm talking loud not saying much
Do            Sol       Lam                
I'm criticized but all your bullets ricochet
Do               Sol              Lam   
You shoot me down, but I get up


Fa              Sol               Mim
I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
     Lam           Fa
fire away, fire away
      Sol                 Mim
ricochet, you take your aim
      Lam         Fa
fire away, fire away
              Sol                Mim
you shoot me down but I won't fall
       Lam   Lasus2   Fa
I am tita - ni  -  um
              Sol                Mim
you shoot me down but I won't fall
       Lam   Lasus2   Fa
I am tita - ni  -  um


Fa Sol Mim Lam 
Fa Sol Mim Lam 


Do         Sol
Cut me down
         Lam                 
but it's you who'll have further to fall
Do         Sol             Lam    
Ghost town, haunted love
Do             Sol     Lam                    
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
Do              Sol              Lam    
I'm talking loud not saying much

I'm bulletproof, nothing to lose
     Lam           Fa
fire away, fire away
      Sol                 Mim
ricochet, you take your aim
      Lam         Fa
fire away, fire away
              Sol                Mim
you shoot me down but I won't fall

Fa          Sol            Mim
Stone-hard, machine gun
              Lam
Firing at the ones who run
Fa          Sol                 Lam
stone hard, as bulletproof glass
