[<pre>               Mim           Re     Sol
He could be a sinner, or a gentleman
                   Mim                 Re       Sol
He could be your preacher, when your soul is down
                  Mim          Re        Sim        Lam
He could be your lawyer on a witness stand but
Lam                           Mim  Do   Sol
He'll never love you like I can can can
                 Mim                Re        Sol
He could be a stranger, he gave a certain glance
               Mim           Re          Sol
He could be a trophy, of a one night stand
                    Mim           Re           Sim           Lam
He could have your humor, but I don't understand cause
Lam                           Mim  Do   Sol
He'll never love you like I can can can
Re                        Sim             Mim
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads
Do                              Mim           Re
When mine is the heart and the soul of the song
Re                        Sim             Mim
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
Lam                           Mim  Do   Sol
He'll never love you like I can can can
            Mim         Re      Sol
A chance encounter of circumstance
             Mim                 Re       Sol
Baby he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced
                 Mim             Re   Sim            Lam
He could be the silence in this mayhem, but then again
Lam                          Mim   Do   Sol
He'll never love you like I can can can
Re                        Sim             Mim
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads
Do                              Mim           Re
When mine is the heart and the soul of the song
Re                        Sim             Mim
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
Lam                          Mim   Do   Sol
He'll never love you like I can can can
    Mim                     Re         Sol
We both have demons, that we can't stand
   Mim                     Re      Sol
I love your demons, like devils can
    Mim                      Re      Sol
If you're still seeking an honest man
      Lam            Si                        
And stop deceiving Lord please
