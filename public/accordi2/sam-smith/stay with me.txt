Lam7                       Fa               Do
 Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand
Lam7                Fa                  Do
 But I still need love cause I'm just a man
Lam7                  Fa          Do
 These nights never seem to go to plan
Lam7                   Solsus                 Do
 I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?


         Lam   Fa     Do
Won't you stay with me?
           Lam   Fa  Do
Cause you're all I need
  Sol      Lam             Fa      Do
This ain't love it's clear to see
     Sol#dim  Lam   Fa    Do
But darling, stay with me


Lam7     Fa         Do       
 Why am I so emotional?
Lam7                  Fa               Do
 No it's not a good look, gain some self control
Lam7                Fa           Do
 And deep down I know this never works
Lam7                   Solsus          Do
 But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt


         Lam   Fa     Do

           Lam   Fa  Do
Cause you're all I need
  Sol       Lam           Fa       Do
This ain't love it's clear to see

Oh oh oh ohhh oh ohhh oh ohhh

Oh oh oh ohhh oh ohhh oh ohhh
