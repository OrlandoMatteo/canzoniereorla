[<pre>Mi 
Yes I do, I believe
Mi 
That one day I will be, where I was
                            Laadd9
Right there, right next to you
 Laadd9
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
 Laadd9
The moon, the stars, are nothing without you
       Mi
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
                                           Laadd9
No words can explain, the way I'm missing you
Laadd9
The night, this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
Laadd9
These tears, they tell their own story


    Fa#m             La                Do#m         Si
You told me not to cry when you were gone
          Fa#m         La                      Mi     La/Si
But the feelings overwhelming, it's much too strong
    Mi             Do#m           Fa#m   La
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
     Mi                 Do#m
And make sure you're alright
                  Fa#m
I'll take care of you, 
       La                       La/Si                   Mi 
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight


        Mi
I'm reaching out to you
                 La
Can you hear my call?
      Mi
This hurt that I've been through
                                    La
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy


    Fa#m             La                Do#m         Si
You told me not to cry when you were gone
          Fa#m         La                      Mi/Si    La/Si
But the feelings overwhelming, it's much too strong
    Mi        Si/Re# Do#m           Fa#m   La
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
     Mi                 Do#m
And make sure you're alright
                  Fa#m
I'll take care of you, 
       La                       La/Si                   Fa#m
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

Fa#m     La     Re       Si7sus2
Lay me down tonight
Fa#m    La        Re     Si7sus2
lay me by your side
Fa#m     La     Re       Si7sus2
Lay me down tonight
Fa#m    La        Re     Si7sus2
lay me by your side
    Mi             Do#m          Fa#m    La    La/Si    Mi
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you</pre>]
