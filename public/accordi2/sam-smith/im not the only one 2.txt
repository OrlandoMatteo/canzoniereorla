Fa  La7         Rem        La#maj7
    You and me, we made a vow
Fa    La7         Rem     La#maj7
  For better or for worse
Fa  La7              Rem        La#
  I can't believe you let me down
        Fa             Do      Fa
But the proof's in the way it hurts
    La7           Rem         La#
For months on end I've had my doubts
Fa   La7       Rem     La#
   Denying every tear
Fa  La7          Rem          La#
  I wish this would be over now
      Fa                Do       Fa
But I know that I still need you here

    Fa La7  Rem   La#maj7
You say I'm crazy
       Fa
'Cause you don't think
     La7                Rem   La#maj7
I've known what you've done
    Fa  La7  Rem  Do La#
But when you call me baby
  Fa               La#/Do  Fa   La#/Do
I know I'm not the only   one

Fa       La7        Rem       La#
  You've been so unavailable
Fa   La7     Rem      La#maj7
 Now sadly I know why
Fa    La7       Rem         La#
 Your heart is unobtainable
      Fa         Do         Fa
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

    Fa La7  Rem   La#maj7
You say I'm crazy
       Fa
'Cause you don't think
     La7                Rem   La#maj7
I've known what you've done
    Fa  La7  Rem  Do La#
But when you call me baby
  Fa               La#/Do  Fa   La#/Do
I know I'm not the only   one

La#                   Fa
 I have loved you for many years
La7                  Rem    Do   La#
Maybe I am just not enough
                           Fa
You've made me realize my deepest fear
   La#/Do                Do7
By lying and tearing us up

    Fa La7  Rem   La#maj7
You say I'm crazy
       Fa
'Cause you don't think

I know I'm not the only   one

I know I'm not the only one
       Fa          La7  Rem  La#
I know I'm not the only one
      Fa
And I know  And I know
      La7
And I know  And I know
    Rem
And I know
Do          La#
And I don't know
  Fa               La#/Do Fa
I know I'm not the only   one
