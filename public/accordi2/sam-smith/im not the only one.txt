Fa   La             Rem         La#
   You and me we made a vow
Fa       La             Rem     La#
   For better or for worse
Fa     La                 Rem          La#
   I can't believe you let me down
          Fa              Do      Fa
But the proof is in the way it hurts
Fa       La                  Rem      La#
   For months on end I've had my doubts
Fa     La           Rem       La#
   Denying every tear
Fa     La                Rem         La#
   I wish this would be over now
           Fa                Do        Fa
But I know   that I still need you here


    Fa La       Rem   La#
You say I'm crazy
       Fa                  La          Rem    La#
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
     Fa La      Rem  Do   La#
But when you call me baby
    Fa               Do   Fa    La#
I know I'm not the only one


Fa          La          Rem       La#
   You've been so unavailable
Fa       La           Rem         La#
   Now sadly I know why
Fa        La             Rem      La#
   Your heart is unobtainable
        Fa          Do             Fa
Even though Lord knows you have mine


    Fa La       Rem   La#
You say I'm crazy
       Fa                  La          Rem    La#
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
     Fa La      Rem  Do   La#
But when you call me baby
    Fa               Do   Fa    La#
I know I'm not the only one


La#                        Fa
   I have loved you for many years
 La                     Rem  Do
Maybe I am just not enough
La#                            Fa
   You've made me realise my deepest fear
    La#/Do                   
By lying and tearing us up


    Fa La       Rem   La#
You say I'm crazy
       Fa                  La            Rem    La#
Cause you don't think I know what you've done

And I know and I know and I know and I know
Rem          Do        La#
And I know and I know know
    Fa              Do    Fa
I know I'm not the only one</pre>]
