[<pre>Lam                         Do
  You must think that I'm stupid
Sol                           Rem
  You must think that I'm a fool
Lam                         Do
  You must think that I'm new to this
Sol                            Rem 
  But I have seen this all before


    Lam
I'm never gonna let you close to me
Do
Even though you mean the most to me
       Sol                        Rem
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
       Lam
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Do
Even when I mean the most to you
   Sol                               Rem
In case you go and leave me in the dirt


               Lam                         Do
Every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
                   Sol                               Rem
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
                   Lam                         Do
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
                       Sol                           Rem
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true


                         Lam                            Do
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)
                         Sol                             Rem
I'm way too good at goodbyes (I'm way too good at goodbyes)


Lam                            Do
  I know you're thinking I'm heartless
Sol                             Rem
  I know you're thinking I'm cold
Lam                        Do
  I'm just protecting my innocence
Sol                         Rem
  I'm just protecting my soul
