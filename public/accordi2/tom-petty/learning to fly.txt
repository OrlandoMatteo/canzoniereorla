       Fa Do  Lam Sol   Fa Do  Lam Sol

       Fa Do  Lam Sol   Fa Do  Lam Sol

       Fa       Do  Lam Sol
Well I started out
       Fa     Do  Lam Sol
down a dirty road
Fa      Do  Lam Sol
Started out
Fa   Do    Lam Sol
all alone
        Fa       Do   Lam Sol
And the sun went down
     Fa          Do   Lam Sol
as I crossed the hill
        Fa       Do  Lam Sol
And the town lit up,
    Fa        Do    Lam Sol
the world got still

    Fa          Do  Lam Sol
I'm learning to fly,
      Fa        Do    Lam Sol
but I ain't got wings
Fa     Do   Lam Sol
Coming down
       Fa      Do    Lam Sol
is the hardest thing

         Fa       Do  Lam Sol
Well the good ol' days
    Fa    Do   Lam Sol
may not return
        Fa          Do   Lam Sol
And the rocks might melt
        Fa      Do   Lam Sol
and the sea may burn

    Fa          Do  Lam Sol
I'm learning to fly,
      Fa        Do    Lam Sol
but I ain't got wings
Fa     Do   Lam Sol
Coming down
       Fa      Do    Lam Sol
is the hardest thing

       Fa Do  Lam Sol   Fa Do  Lam Sol

       Fa Do  Lam Sol   Fa Do  Lam Sol

     Fa       Do   Lam Sol
Well some say life
     Fa       Do   Lam Sol
will beat you down
Fa         Do    Lam Sol
Break your heart,
Fa         Do    Lam Sol
steal your crown
        Fa      Do  Lam Sol
So I've started out
    Fa        Do    Lam Sol
for God knows where
  Fa         Do    Lam Sol
I guess I'll know
     Fa    Do    Lam Sol
when I get there

    Fa          Do   Lam Sol
I'm learning to fly,
 Fa        Do     Lam Sol
around the clouds
    Fa        Do  Lam Sol
But what goes up
Fa        Do    Lam Sol
must come down

       Fa Do  Lam Sol   Fa Do  Lam Sol

    Fa          Do  Lam Sol
I'm learning to fly,
      Fa        Do    Lam Sol
but I ain't got wings
Fa     Do   Lam Sol
Coming down
       Fa      Do    Lam Sol
is the hardest thing
    Fa          Do   Lam Sol
I'm learning to fly,
 Fa        Do     Lam Sol
around the clouds
    Fa        Do  Lam Sol
But what goes up
Fa        Do    Lam Sol
must come down
    Fa          Do  Lam Sol
I'm learning to fly,

Fa Do   Lam Sol

    Fa          Do  Lam Sol
I'm learning to fly...

Fa Do   Lam Sol
