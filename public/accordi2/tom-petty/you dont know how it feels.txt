Mi               La
Let me run with you tonight
     Mi            La            Mi  La  Mi  La
I'll take you on a moonlight ride
Mi                La
There's someone I used to see
    Mi               La        Mi  La  Mi  La
But she don't give a damn for me
           Mi         Si           Mi           La
But let me get to the point, let's roll another joint
             Mi    Si             Mi         La
And turn the radio loud, I'm too alone to be proud
Mi        Re          La
You don't know how it feels
Mi        Re          La
You don't know how it feels to be me

Mi           La
People come, people go
Mi               La           Mi  La  Mi  La
Some grow young, some grow cold
Mi        La
I woke up in between
  Mi     La         Mi  La  Mi  La
A memory and a dream
         Mi         Si           Mi           La
So let's get to the point, let's roll another joint
      Mi               Si
Let's head on down the road
            Mi            La
There's somewhere I gotta go
Mi        Re          La
You don't know how it feels
Mi        Re          La
You don't know how it feels to be me

Mi             La
My old man was born to rock
Mi                   La          Mi  La  Mi  La
He's still tryin' to beat the clock
Mi          La
Think of me what you will
     Mi           La         Mi  La  Mi  La
I've got a little space to fill
         Mi         Si           Mi           La
So let's get to the point, let's roll another joint
          Mi               Si
And let's head on down the road
            Mi             La
There's somewhere I got to go
Mi        Re          La
You don't know how it feels
Mi        Re          La
You don't know how it feels
Mi        Re          La
You don't know how it feels to be me
Mi        Re          La
You don't know how it feels
Mi        Re          La
You don't know how it feels
Mi        Re          La
You don't know how it feels to be me
