La#m              Sol#
She grew up in an Indiana town
      Re#                   La#m
Had a good-lookin' mama who never was around
                             Sol#
But she grew up tall and she grew up right
          Re#                  La#m
With them Indiana boys on them Indiana nights

La#m Sol# Re# La#m     La#m Sol# Re# La#m

          La#m                   Sol#
Well, she moved down here at the age of eighteen
    Re#                     La#m
She blew the boys away, was more than they'd seen
                        Sol#
I was introduced and we both started groovin'
    Re#                          La#m              Sol#
She said, "I dig you baby, but I got to keep movin'  on

Re#    La#m        La#m Sol# Re# La#m
  Keep movin' on"

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain
Fam7                                                   La#  Sol#
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again

La#m Sol# Re# La#m    La#m Sol# Re# La#m

      La#m              Sol#
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
    Re#                  La#m
You never slow down, you never grow old
                          Sol#
I'm tired of screwin' up, tired of going down
Re#               La#m
Tired of myself, tired of this town
           Sol#
Oh, my my, oh, hell yes
Re#                La#m
Honey, put on that party dress
                Sol#
Buy me a drink, sing me a song
Re#                        La#m
Take me as I come 'cause I can't stay long

There's pigeons down on Market Square
  Re#                  La#m
She's standin' in her underwear
                  Sol#
Lookin' down from a hotel room
Re#               La#m
Nightfall will be comin' soon
             Sol#
Oh, my my, oh, hell yes
    Re#                 La#m
You got to put on that party dress
                              Sol#
It was too cold to cry when I woke up alone
  Re#                    La#m
I hit my last number and walked to the road
