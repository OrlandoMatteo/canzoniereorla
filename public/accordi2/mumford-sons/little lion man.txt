[<pre>Lam      Do       x4

Lam
Weep for yourself, my man,
                               Do
you'll never be what is in your heart.
Lam
Weep little lion man,
                                       Do
you're not as brave as you were at the start.
Sol
Rate yourself and rake yourself,
Fa            Famaj7            Do
take all the courage you have left.
Sol
Wasted on fixing all the
Fa                Famaj7             Do
problems that you made in your own head.

But it was not your fault but mine,
         Lam         Fa         Do
and it was your heart on the line.
         Lam        Fa        Do
I really fucked it up this time,
             Sol
didn't I, my dear?
                  Lam
Didn't I, my dear?

Lam
Tremble for yourself my man,
                                       Do
you know that you have seen this all before.
Lam
Tremble little lion man,
                                Do
you'll never settle any of your scores.
Sol
Your grace is wasted in your face,
     Fa               Famaj7            Do
your boldness stands alone among the wreck.
Sol
Learn from your mother or else
Fa               Famaj7            Do
spend your days biting your own neck.
