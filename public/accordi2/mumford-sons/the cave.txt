[<pre>                  Lam             Do
It's empty in the valley of your heart
                  Lam            Do
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
                  Lam
Away from all the fears
            Do          Sol    Do     Fa Do
And all the faults you've left behind

                    Lam              Do
The harvest left no food for you to eat
                  Lam              Do
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
                    Lam
But I have seen the same
           Do        Sol    Do        Fa Do
I know the shame in your defeat


    Do      Fa       Do
But I will hold on hope
    Do       Fa       Do
And I won't let you choke
Fa            Do           Sol
On the noose around your neck

    Lam        Fa           Do
And I'll find strength in pain
    Lam     Fa         Do
And I will change my ways
Fa            Do            Sol
I'll know my name as it's called again

Lam Do Lam Do Lam Do Sol Do Fa Do


             Lam                      Do
Cause I have other things to fill my time
                 Lam                  Do
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
                  Lam
Now let me at the truth
              Do        Sol     Do   Fa Do
Which will refresh my broken mind

               Lam                Do
So tie me to a post and block my ears
          Lam                            Do
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
                Lam
I know my call despite my faults
    Do          Sol       Do      Fa Do
And despite my growing fears


    Do      Fa       Do
But I will hold on hope
    Do       Fa       Do
And I won't let you choke
Fa            Do           Sol
On the noose around your neck

    Lam        Fa           Do
And I'll find strength in pain
    Lam     Fa         Do
And I will change my ways
Fa            Do            Sol         Do
I'll know my name as it's called again


                    Lam                  Do
So come out of your cave walking on your hands
                  Lam             Do
And see the world hanging upside down
                   Lam
You can understand dependence
         Do        Sol       Do     Fa Do
When you know the maker's hand


   Do         Fa       Do
So make your siren's call
    Do    Fa       Do
And sing all you want
  Fa        Do             Sol
I will not hear what you have to say

      Lam     Fa       Do
Cause I need freedom now
   Lam      Fa        Do
And I need to know how
   Fa       Do            Sol
To live my life as it's meant to be

Lam Do Lam Do Lam Do Sol Do Fa Do


    Do      Fa       Do
But I will hold on hope
    Do       Fa       Do
And I won't let you choke
Fa            Do      Sol
On the noose around your neck

    Lam        Fa           Do
And I'll find strength in pain
    Lam     Fa         Do
And I will change my ways
Fa            Do          Sol          Do
I'll know my name as it's called again</pre>]
