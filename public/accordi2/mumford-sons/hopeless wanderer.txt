       La#   Fa7  Solm  Fa  Re#

La#        Fa Dom7         Solm       Fa      Re#
 You heard my voice I came out of the woods by choice
La#           Fa      Dom7
 Shelter also gave their shade
           Solm   Fa    La#
But in the dark I have no name
                    Fa/La Dom7
So leave that click in  my head
           Solm         Fa           Re#
And I will remember the words that you said
La#                        Fa/La  Dom7
 Left a clouded mind and a heavy heart
          Solm          Fa       Re#
But I was sure we could see a new start

Solm  Fa             La#       Re#
        So when your hope's on fire
Solm  Fa             La#    Re#
        But you know your desire
             Solm           Fa/La
Don't hold a glass over the flame
               La#        Re#
Don't let your heart grow cold
       Solm        Fa/La
I will call you by name
       La#        Re#        Solm
I will share your road

Solm
 But hold me fast, Hold me fast
             Re# Solm7 Fa Solm
'Cause I'm a hopeless  wanderer

And hold me fast, Hold me fast
             Re# Solm7 Fa La#   Fa/La Dom7
'Cause I'm a hopeless  wanderer

Solm  Fa  Re#

La#              Fa/La  Dom7
 I wrestled long with my youth
            Solm    Fa        Re#
We tried so hard to live in the truth
La#                 Fa/La Dom7
 But do not tell me all is fine
               Solm    Fa     La#
When I lose my head, I lose my spine
                    Fa/La Dom7
So leave that click in my  head
              Solm        Fa          Re#
And I won't remember the words that you said
La#                 Fa/La  Dom7
 You brought me out from the cold
           Solm        Fa      Re#
Now, how I long, how I long to grow old

Solm  Fa             La#       Re#
        So when your hope's on fire
Solm  Fa             La#    Re#
        But you know your desire
             Solm           Fa/La
Don't hold a glass over the flame
               La#        Re#
Don't let your heart grow cold
       Solm        Fa/La
I will call you by name

 But hold me fast, Hold me fast

'Cause I'm a hopeless  wanderer

And hold me fast, Hold me fast
             Re# Solm7 Fa Solm
'Cause I'm a hopeless  wanderer

I will learn,
                         Re#   Solm7 Fa La#
I will learn to love the skies I'm   under

I will learn,
                         Re#   La# Fa La#
I will learn to love the skies I'm under
    Re#   La# Fa Solm Fa Re#    La#
The skies I'm un-der...
