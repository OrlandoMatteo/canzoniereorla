Lam    Mim7   Do  Fa  Do  Sol


Do
I came home
         Fa
Like a stone
             Do              Sol2
And I fell heavy into your arms
          Do
These days of dust
           Fa
Which we've known
          Do                  Sol2
Will blow away with this new sun


     Lam    Mim7    Do
And I'll kneel down 
  Fa   Do   Sol
Wait for now
    Lam     Mim7    Do
And I'll kneel down
    Fa    Do   Sol
Know my ground


 Do                             Mim   Sol      
I will wait, I will wait for you!
 Do                                 Mim   Sol  
And I will wait, I will wait for you!


Do
So break my step
      Fa
And relent
      Do                    Sol2
You forgave and I won't forget
                Do
Know what we've seen
             Fa
And him with less
            Do                 Sol2  
Now in some way, shake the excess


 Do                                Mim     Sol 
Cause I will wait, I will wait for you!
 Do                                Mim    Sol  
And I will wait, I will wait for you!
 Do                                Mim    Sol  
And I will wait, I will wait for you!
 Do                                Mim    Sol  
And I will wait, I will wait for you!


 Do
Now I'll be bold
            Fa
As well as strong
        Do                        Sol2     Sol
Use my head alongside my heart
           Do
So take my flesh
           Fa
And fix my eyes
              Do                       Sol2  Sol
That tethered mind free from the lies


   Lam    Mim7    Do
And I'll kneel down 
  Fa   Do   Sol
Wait for now
    Lam     Mim7    Do
And I'll kneel down
    Fa    Do   Sol
Know my ground


 Do     Mim7 Lam      Fa   Do   Sol     x2
 
 Do    Mim7 Lam
Raise my hands
 Fa          Do       Sol
Paint my spirit gold
     Do    Mim7 Lam
And bow my head
 Fa          Do      Sol   
Keep my heart slow        


 Do                                Mim     Sol 
Cause I will wait, I will wait for you!
 Do                                Mim    Sol  
And I will wait, I will wait for you!
 Do                                Mim    Sol  
And I will wait, I will wait for you!
 Do                               Mim     Sol    Do
And I will wait, I will wait for you!</pre>]
