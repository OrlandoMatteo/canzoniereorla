Mim      Re           Do
 Lost in time I can't count the words
  Mim         Re           Do
I said when I thought they went unheard
Mim          Re     Do
All of those harsh thoughts so unkind
            Mim      Re  Do
'Cause I wanted you
    Mim       Re       Do
And now I sit here I'm all alone
   Mim          Re          Do
So here sits a bloody mess, tears fly home
  Mim       Re      Do
A circle of angels, deep in war
         Mim      Re  Do
'Cause I wanted you

          Mim Re  Do
Weak as I am,  no tears for you
          Mim Re  Do
Weak as I am,  no tears for you
          Mim Re    Do
Deep as I am,   I'm no one's fool
          Mim  Re  Do
Weak as I am

   Mim        Re      Do
So what am I now? I'm love's last home
    Mim        Re         Do
I'm all of the soft words I once owned
     Mim       Re                Do
If I opened my heart, there'd be no space for air
         Mim      Re  Do
'Cause I wanted you

          Mim Re  Do
Weak as I am,  no tears for you
          Mim Re  Do
Weak as I am,  no tears for you
          Mim Re    Do
Deep as I am,   I'm no one's fool
          Mim  Re  Do
Weak as I am

Sol       La
  In this tainted soul
        Do
In this weak young heart
         Re             Sol
Am I too much for you?
        La
In this tainted soul
        Do
In this weak young heart
         Re             Sol
Am I too much for you?
        La
In this tainted soul
        Do
In this weak young heart
         Re
Am I too much for you?

          Mim  Re  Do
Weak as I am
          Mim  Re  Do
Weak as I am
          Mim  Re  Do
Weak as I am
          Mim  Re  Do
Weak as I am
          Mim    Re    Do
Weak as I am, am I too much for you?
          Mim    Re    Do
Weak as I am, am I too much for you?
          Mim    Re    Do
Weak as I am, am I too much for you?
          Mim  Re  Do    Mim  Re  Do
Weak as I am
