Survived, tonight, I may be going down
   Sol                   Famaj7
'Cos everything goes round too, tight
  Mim                Fa
Tonight, and as, you watch me crawl

You stand for more
         Lam             Re                 Fa     Mi4  Mi

'Cos I don't want you, to forgive me
       Sol       Fa                     Fa#m7b5                Sol
You'll follow me down, you'll follow me down, you'll follow me down

Survive, tonight, (I see your) heads exposed

So we shall kill, constructive might

You'll follow me down, you'll follow me down, you'll follow me down

        La#       Lam
I won't feel restraint
Mim                      Sol
Watching you close sense down
        La#     Lam
I can't compensate
       Mi                    Mi7
That's more than I've got to give
