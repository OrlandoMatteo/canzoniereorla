     Do#m  Do#m  Do#m  Do#m

Como puede ser verdad...

Do#m         Si            Do#m
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
La     Do#m     Mi            Si
  Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
  Do#m            Si            Do#m
A young girl with eyes like the desert
La   Do#m           Mi             Si
  It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Do#m         Si
Tropical the island breeze
Fa#m          Mi
All of nature wild and free
Si              Fa#m
This is where I long to be
Fa#m    Si Do#m
La isla bo_nita
Do#m           Si
  And when the samba played
Fa#m            Mi
  The sun would set so high
     Si                  Fa#m
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
     Fa#m    Si   Do#m
Your Spanish lullaby

Do#m      Si            Do#m
I fell in love with San Pedro
La     Do#m        Mi             Si
  Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Do#m  Si      Do#m
   Te dijo te amo
La  Do#m            Mi                    Si
  I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

Do#m         Si
Tropical the island breeze
Fa#m          Mi
All of nature wild and free
Si              Fa#m
This is where I long to be
Fa#m    Si Do#m
La isla bo_nita
Do#m           Si
  And when the samba played
Fa#m            Mi
  The sun would set so high
     Si                  Fa#m
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
     Fa#m    Si   Do#m
Your Spanish lullaby


     Do#m

Fa#m      Re           Mi            Fa#m
I want to be where the sun warms the sky
          Fa#m       Re           Mi
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Fa#m      Re        Mi            Fa#m
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
        Fa#m         Mi         Mi     Sol#7   Do#m
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy... loves a girl


     Do#m     Si Do#m

     La   Do#m   Mi   Si

Do#m         Si            Do#m
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
La   Do#m           Mi             Si
  It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Do#m         Si
Tropical the island breeze
Fa#m          Mi
All of nature wild and free
Si              Fa#m
This is where I long to be
Fa#m    Si Do#m
La isla bo_nita
Do#m           Si
  And when the samba played
Fa#m            Mi
  The sun would set so high
     Si                  Fa#m
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
     Fa#m    Si   Do#m
Your Spanish lullaby.
