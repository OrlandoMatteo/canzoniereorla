 I think you wanna come over

Yeah I heard it thru the grapevine

Are you drunk? Are you sober? (Think about it)

Doesn't matter

And if it makes you feel good then I say do it

I don't know what you're waiting for

Boy you got a reputation

But you're gonna have to prove it

I see a little hesitation

Am I gonna have to show ya

That if it feels right

Get on your mark

Step to the beat boy

that's what its for
