       Lam  Mim  Sol  Famaj7   Lam  Mim  Sol  Famaj7

  Lam                 Mim
I just woke up from a fuzzy dream
    Sol                                   Famaj7
You never would believe those things that I had seen
  Lam                        Mim
I looked in the mirror and I saw your face
    Sol                               Famaj7
You looked right through me, you were miles away
Lam                Mim
All my dreams they fade away
Sol               Famaj7
I'll never be the same
   Lam                          Mim
If you could see me the way you see yourself
           Sol                 Famaj7
I can't pretend to be someone else

                  Lam           Mim
You always love me more, miles away
                  Sol                 Famaj7
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
                     Lam             Mim
You're not afraid to tell me, miles away
                     Sol                    Famaj7
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
        Lam  Mim  Sol  Famaj7
So far away...
        Lam  Mim  Sol  Famaj7
So far away...

     Lam                    Mim
When no one’s around then I have you here
    Sol                          Famaj7
I begin to see the picture, it becomes so clear
    Lam             Mim
You always have the biggest heart,
     Sol                Famaj7
When we’re six thousand miles apart
Lam         Mim
Too much of no sound
  Sol                     Famaj7
Uncomfortable silence can be so loud
Lam                   Mim
Those three words are never enough
     Sol                Famaj7
When it’s long distance love

                  Lam           Mim
You always love me more, miles away
                  Sol                 Famaj7
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
                     Lam             Mim
You're not afraid to tell me, miles away
                     Sol                    Famaj7
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
        Lam  Mim  Sol  Famaj7
So far away...
        Lam  Mim  Sol  Famaj7
So far away...

Rem7   Sol             Mim7            Lam
 I’m alright, don’t be sorry, but it’s true
         Rem7           Mim7
When I’m gone you’ll realize
             Famaj7
That I’m the best thing that happened to you

                  Lam           Mim
You always love me more, miles away
                  Sol                 Famaj7
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
                     Lam             Mim
You're not afraid to tell me, miles away
                     Sol                    Famaj7
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
                  Lam           Mim
You always love me more, miles away
                  Sol                 Famaj7
I hear it in your voice, we're miles away
                     Lam             Mim
You're not afraid to tell me, miles away
                     Sol                    Famaj7
I guess we're at our best when we're miles away
        Lam  Mim  Sol  Famaj7
So far away...
        Lam  Mim  Sol  Famaj7
So far away...
        Lam  Mim  Rem7  Do
So far away...
        Lam  Mim  Rem7  Do
So far away...
