          Lam         Mi+ 
There’s a lady who’s sure
         Do           Re
All that glitters is gold
          Fa                    Sol  Lam
And she’s buying a stairway to heaven.
         Lam             Mi+ 
When she gets there she knows
       Do              Re
If the stores are all closed
       Fa                         Sol    Lam
With a word she can get what she came for.
Do    Re    Fa    Lam            Do        Sol              Re
Ooh, ooh, Ooh, ooh and she’s buying a stairway to heaven.

          Lam          Mi+ 
There’s a sign on the wall
        Do           Re
But she wants to be sure
          Fa                             Sol   Lam
cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
     Lam          Mi+ 
In a tree by the brook
          Do            Re
There’s a songbird who sings,
          Fa                       Sol  Lam
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.

Lam Mi+ Do Re Fa Sol Lam

Re                Lam    Mim Re Do Re
Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Re  Re4 Re                Lam   Mim Re Do Re
Ooh,      and it makes me wonder.

          Do         Sol
There’s a feeling I get
       Lam
When I look to the west,
       Do         Sol          Fa   Lam
And my spirit is crying for leaving.
      Do               Sol
In my thoughts I have seen
         Lam
Rings of smoke through the trees,
        Do         Sol               Fa   Lam 
And the voices of those who stand looking.

Do Sol Lam

Re                Lam    Mim Re Do Re
Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Re  Re4 Re                Lam   Mim Re Do Re
Ooh,      and it makes me wonder.

        Do              Sol
And its whispered that soon
      Lam          
If we all call the tune
         Do          Sol          Fa   Lam
Then the piper will lead us to reason.
      Do            Sol
And a new day will dawn
    Lam
For those who stand long
        Do            Sol         Fa    Lam
And the forests will echo with laughter.

Do Sol Lam

Lam Re   Lam  Mim Re Do Re

Lam
Ooooh

Re        Lam   Mim Re Do Re
Oooooooh

Do            Sol              Lam
If there’s a bustle in your hedgerow
         Sol
Don’t be alarmed now,
Do           Sol                    Lam
It’s just a spring clean for the may queen.
Do              Sol                 Lam
Yes, there are two paths you can go by
           Sol
But in the long run
Do             Sol                  Lam
There’s still time to change the road you’re on.
Re                Lam    Mim Re Do Re
Ooh, it makes me wonder

Do            Sol              Lam
Your head is humming and it won’t go
        Sol
In case you don’t know,
Do          Sol              Lam
The pipers calling you to join him,
Do          Sol                Lam
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow,
        Sol
And did you know
Do             Sol           Lam              Do Sol Lam
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.

Lam        Sol                Fa   Sol  Lam
And as we wind on down the road
            Sol               Fa   Sol  Lam
Our shadows taller than our soul.
              Sol           Fa   Sol  Lam
There walks a lady we all know
           Sol                        Fa   Sol  Lam
Who shines white light and wants to show
         Sol                    Fa   Sol  Lam
How everything still turns to gold.
           Sol           Fa   Sol  Lam
And if you listen very hard
              Sol              Fa   Sol  Lam
The tune will come to you at last.
             Sol              Fa  Sol  Lam
When all are one and one is all
        Sol               Fa
To be a rock and not to roll.

          Fa        Sol              Lam
And she’s buying a stairway to heaven.</pre>]
