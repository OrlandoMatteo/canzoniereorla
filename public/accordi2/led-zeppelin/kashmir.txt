Oh let the sun beat down upon my face, stars to fill my dream
               Re5                   Re6                   Re7   Re5
I am a traveler of both time and space, to be where I have been
                 Re5               Re6                      Re7   Re5
To sit with elders of the gentle race, this world has seldom seen
                     Re5                    Re6                   Re7
They talk of days for which they sit and wait, and all will be revealed

Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace, whose sounds caress my ear
                Re5                Re6                     Re7    Re5
But not a word I heard could I relate, the story was quite clear

Oh....        Oh....

 All I see turns to brown, as the sun burns the ground
Solm                 La      Solm             La
 And my eyes, fill with sand, as I scan, this wasted land
Solm                                        La
 Trying to find, trying to find where I've been

Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace, like thoughts inside a dream
                 Re5                 Re6                   Re7   Re5
Heed the path that led me to that place, yellow desert stream
               Re5                 Re6                    Re7   Re5
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon, I will return again

Sure as the dust that floats high in June, when movin' through Kashmir

Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails, across the sea of years
                 Re5             Re6                      Re7   Re5
With no provision but an open face, along the straits of fear
