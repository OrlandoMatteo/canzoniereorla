Mi                 Mi11    La    La4
   Leaves are fallin' all around
Mi           Mi11     La    La4
   Time I was on my way
Mi                Mi11    La     La4
   Thanks to you, I'm much obliged
Mi            Mi11    La    La4
   For such a pleasant stay

Mi              Mi11     La    La4
   But now it's time for me to go
Mi                 Mi11      La   La4
   The autumn moon lights my way
Mi                     Mi11      La   La4
   For now I smell the rain, and with it, pain
Mi                Mi11       La    La4
   And it's headed my way
Mi Fa#m7 Mi/Sol# La
             Aw, sometimes I grow so tired
Mi Fa#m7 Mi/Sol#   La       Mi
             But I know I've got one thing I got to do

  Mi                       La              La4
A-ramble on, and now's the time, the time is now
Mi                      La                 La4
Sing my song, I'm goin' round the world, I gotta find my girl
Mi                        La      La4
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
Mi               La                La4
Ramble on, gotta find the queen of all my dreams

Mi      Mi11        La     La4
 Got no time for spreadin' roots
    Mi       Mi11    La   La4
The time has come to be gone
Mi              Mi11      La      La4
 And though our health we drank a thousand times
Mi    Mi11    La     La4
 It's time to ramble on

Mi Mi11  La La4

  Mi                       La              La4
A-ramble on, and now's the time, the time is now
Mi                      La               La4
Sing my song, I'm goin' round the world, I gotta find my girl
Mi                        La      La4
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
        Mi
I gotta ramble on
La      La4
I gotta find the queen of all my dreams I tell you no lie

Mi                 Mi11    La   La4
Mine's a tale that can't be told
Mi      Mi11 La   La4
My freedom I hold dear
Mi               Mi11    La    La4
How years ago in days of old
Mi         Mi11   La    La4
When magic filled the air

Mi          Mi11    La        La4
Twas in the darkest depths of Mordor
Mi     Mi11       La    La4
Mmm, I met a girl so fair
    Mi             Mi11    La   La4
But Gollum and the evil one
Mi           Mi11    La     La4
Crept up and slipped away with her, her, her, yeah

and ain't nothin' I can do, no
   Mi                   La            La4
I guess I'll keep on ramblin', I'm gonna
Mi                     La               La4
Sing my song, sh-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I've gotta find my baby
Mi                        La       La4
I'm gonna ramble on, sing my song

gonna work my way all around the world
        Mi           La       La4
Baby, baby - ramble on, yeah...
