Do#/Fa Si/Re#       Do#7sus4 Fa#    Si
 Rows  and floes of angel  hair
    Fa#       Do#7       Fa#      Si
And ice cream castles in the air
    Fa#     Si/Re# Do#7sus4        Do#7
And feather canyons  everywhere
               Si          Fa#4  Mi
I've looked at clouds that way

Fa#                Do#7sus4    Fa#  Si
 But now they only block the sun
     Fa#           Do#7   Fa#
They rain and snow on everyone
        Si/Re#   Do#7sus4
So many things I would have done
           Si        Fa#4   Mi   Fa#
But clouds got in my way
               Do#7sus4                 Fa#
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
            Do#7 Fa#            Do#7  Fa#
From up and down, and still somehow
           Si       Fa#
It's cloud illusions  I recall
  Do#7         Si/Re# Do#7sus4     Fa#  Si
I really don't know   clouds at  all

Fa#   Si Fa#    Si Fa#    Si

Do#/Fa    Si/Re#      Do#7sus4 Fa#
  Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
             Do#7     Fa#
The dizzy dancing way you feel
   Do#/Fa Si/Re# Do#7sus4
As every fairy   tale comes real
Do#7            Si        Fa#4  Mi
 I've looked at love that way

Fa#      Si         Do#7   Fa#
 But now it's just another show
                 Do#7sus4     Fa#
You leave 'em laughing when you go
    Do#/Fa Si/Re#  Do#7sus4
And if you  care, don't let them know
Do#7       Si         Fa#4  Mi  Fa#
 Don't give yourself away
               Do#7sus4                 Fa#

Do#/Fa  Si/Re#   Do#7sus4      Fa#
 Tears and fears and feeling proud
               Do#7       Fa#
To say "I love you" right out loud
           Si     Do#7sus4
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
Do#7            Si      Fa#4   Mi   Fa#
 I've looked at life that way
          Si            Do#7sus4  Fa#
But now old friends are acting strange
                        Do#7     Fa#
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
     Do#/Fa Si/Re#    Do#7sus4
Well something's lost, but something's gained
Do#7       Si    Fa#4   Mi  Fa#
 In living every day
               Do#7sus4                 Fa#
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
