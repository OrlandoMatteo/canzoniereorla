[<pre> Mim                       Lam        Re7                       Sol
Strumming my pain with his fingers.  singing my life with his words.
 Mim                      La                       Re        Reo
Killing me softly with his song.  Killing me softly with his song.
           Sol               Reo
Telling my whole life with his words.
           Famaj7#11           Mi
Killing me softly,  with his song.

I heard he sang the good song.
Sol          Reo
I heard he had a style.
Lam7        Re
And so I came to see him,
    Mim
and listen for a while.
Lam7          Re7
And there he was a young boy
Sol          Si7
a stranger to my eyes.

Lam7        Re
I felt all flushed with fever
Sol          Reo
embarrassed by the crowd.
Lam7        Re
I felt he found my letters
    Mim
and read each one out loud.
Lam7          Re7
I prayed that he would finish
Sol          Si7
but he just kept right on.
