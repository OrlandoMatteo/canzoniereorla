You're keeping in step

In the line

Got your chin held high and you feel just fine

Cause you do

What you're told

But inside your heart it is black
                         Fa
and it's hollow and it's cold
                       Re
Just how deep do you believe?
                            La
Will you bite the hand that feeds?

Will you chew until it bleeds?
                        Fa
Can you get up off your knees?

Are you brave enough to see?

Do you want to change it?

What if this whole crusade's

A charade

And behind it all there's a price to be paid

For the blood   On which we dine
                                            Fa
Justified in the name of the holy and the divine

 So naive

I keep holding on to what I want to believe

I can see
                                          Fa  Re  La
But I keep holding on and on and on and on

 Will you bite the hand that feeds you?

Will you stay down on your knees?
