 You let me violate you, you let me desecrate you

You let me penetrate you, you let me complicate you

Help me I broke apart my insides, help me I've got no soul to sell

Help me the only thing that works for me, help me get away from myself

                         Fam
I wanna fuck you like an animal

I wanna feel you from the inside

I wanna fuck you like an animal

My whole existence is flawed
                      Do   Do# Re# Fam
You get me closer to God

Do                  Do# Re#
You can have my isolation,
Do                             Do#  Re#
you can have the hate that it brings
Do              Do#        Re#
You can have my absence of faith,
Do                        Do# Re#
you can have my everything

Help me tear down my reason,
Do                           Do# Re#
help me it's your sex I can smell
Do                   Do#   Re#
Help me you make me perfect,
Do
help me become somebody else

I wanna fuck you like an animal

I wanna feel you from the inside

I wanna fuck you like an animal

My whole existence is flawed
                      Do    Do4 Do
You get me closer to God

Fam
 Through every forest, above the trees

Within my stomach, scraped off my knees

I drink the honey inside your hive

You are the reason I stay alive
