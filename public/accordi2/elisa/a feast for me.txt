[<pre>                        Sim                        La
Well there's a party for me, The last thing I wanted from you
Sim                                              La
I close the door behind me And there you are
                   Sim                                         La
You seem relaxed and quiet, But under your shirt you sweat
                   Sim                                  La
And these balloons around, Make me feel so sad

Sim     La   Sim    La

Well there's a feast for me, But it's a night so pale
Feels like an empty room, Where we could kill with words
You wish you could make believe, That I'm what you want me to be
But these balloons around, Make me feel so sad

                   Sol                            La
I'm in your sweet sweet sweet embrace
                        Sim                Fa#m
And you're a thousand miles away
                       Sol                         La
Your arms a sweet sweet sweet embrace
                        Sim                  Fa#m
And you're a thousand miles away

Well there's a party for me,  And you know that I didn't ask for it
I just stay in your game,  I'm just playing your game
So won't you tell me what to do,  I can pretend that you tell the truth
Won't you tell me what to do, I can pretend you tell the truth

I'm in your sweet sweet sweet embrace ...

Sim  La   Sol  La   Sim La  Sol La
Why      why     why    why

 Re                                    Sol
Should I take the blame, Where's my big mistake
Sim                                  Do
Should I feel happy, For what I haven't done
Re                                    Sol
Should I take the blame, Should I feel the pain
Sim                                   Do
Should I feel regret, For what I haven't done
Sim La  Sol  La    Sim  La  Sol La
Why     why     why     why

Was this a feast for me, Or just a bad surprise
Should I have expected this, I just don't wanna know
And you've made up the rules, So that you'll win this game
But you can't tell me what to do, Cause I don't believe in you
What's left a sweet sweet sweet embrace
And you're a thousand miles away
Your arms a sweet sweet sweet embrace
And you're a thousand miles away
Why why I never ask you why why</pre>]
