La
trying that way
Mi
are you still
Si
praying the same prayers
Do#m7
are you still
La
waiting for that same day to come
Mi
climbing the same mountain

you're not getting higher
       Si
you're running after yourself

you can't let go
Do#m7
hiding in that place you don't wanna be
         La
you push happiness so far away

but it comes back
Mi
to give you all that you've given before
Si
to love you the way that you do, like a mirror
Do#m7
look in the air 'n catch that boomerang
      La
can't fall anywhere else but in your own
   Mi   Si
so make heaven
Do#m7         La
heaven out of hell now
         Mi
if you do
     Si
make heaven
Do#m7         La        Mi
heaven out of hell now...
     Si
make heaven
Do#m7         La        Mi
heaven out of hell now
     Si
make heaven
Do#m7         La
heaven out of hell now

I wanna fly because
   Mi
I dream (dream dream dream)
Si       Do#m7         La
heaven,  heaven out of hell now

Mi  Do#m7  Remaj7  Do#m9
