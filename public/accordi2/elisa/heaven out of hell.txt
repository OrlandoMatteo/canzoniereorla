Do#m    La      Mi     Si          Do#m  La  Mi  Si
So are you turning around your mind

Do#m    La         Mi         Si          Do#m  La  Mi  Si
do you think the sun won't shine this time

Do#m     La         Mi    Si           Do#m  La  Mi  Si
are you breathing only half of the air

Do#m     La      Mi    Si         Do#m   La  Mi  Si
are you giving only half of a chance


                Mi
don't you wanna shake because you love

 Si4
(cry) because you care

 Do#m7
(feel) 'cause you're alive

 Laadd9
(sleep) because you're tired

 Mi
(shake) because you love

 Si4
(cry) because you care

 Do#m7                 Laadd9
(feel) 'cause you're alive


Mi      Si4   Do#m7          Laadd9
  make heaven, heaven out of hell now

Mi      Si4   Do#m7          Laadd9

  make heaven, heaven out of hell now



Do#m     La            Mi       Si        Do#m  La  Mi  Si
are you locked up in you counting the days

Do#m    La      Mi       Si        Do#m   La      Mi     Si
oh how long until you have your freedom your freedom



     Mi
just shake because you love
 Si4
(cry) because you care

 Do#m7
(feel) 'cause you're alive

 Laadd9
(sleep) because you're tired

 Mi
(shake) because you love

 Si4
(bleed) 'cause you got hurt

 Do#m7             Aadd9(#11)
(die) because you lived

  make heaven, heaven out of hell now

Mi      Si4   Do#m7          Laadd9

Mi             Si4
are you still turning around the same things

Do#m7          Laadd9
are you still trying that way

Mi             Si4
are you still praying the same prayers

Do#m7          Laadd9
are you still waiting for that same day to come



Mi
climbing the same mountain

you're not getting higher

Si4
running after yourself

you can't let go

Do#m7
hiding in that place you don't wanna be

         Laadd9
you push happiness so far away

but it comes back

Mi



to give you all that you've given before

Si4
to love you the way you do, like a mirror

Do#m7
look in the air 'n catch that boomerang

      Laadd9
can't fall anywhere else but in your own hand



Mi      Si4   Do#m7          Laadd9
  make heaven, heaven out of hell now

Mi      Si4   Do#m7          Laadd9
  make heaven, heaven out of hell now

                Mi
  are you still waiting (make heaven)

Si4           Do#m7
  are you still praying (heaven out of hell now)

Laadd9           Mi            Si4
  are you still losing (make heaven, heaven out of hell now)

Do#m7      Laadd9         Mi
  I wanna fly because I dream dream dream...

        Si4   Do#m7          Laadd9
  (make heaven, heaven out of hell now)
