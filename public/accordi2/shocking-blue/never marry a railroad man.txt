Have you been broken-hearted once or twice
                        Rem
If it's yes how did you feel at his first lies

If it's no you need this good advice
              Do
Never marry a Railroad man
                   Rem
He loves you every now and then
                    La# Fa          Mim Rem
His heart is at his new  train  No, no, no
                          Do
Don't fall in love with a Railroad man
                 Rem
If you do forget him if you can

You're better off without him ah...
