              Sol
I've seen the world
        Mim
Done it all
       Sim
Had my cake now
   Sol        Mim
Diamonds, brilliant
        Sim
And Bel Air now
           Sol           La
Hot summer nights, mid July
             Sim            Re
When you and I were forever wild
          Sol        La
The crazy days, city lights
              Sim                 Re
The way you'd play with me like a child

Sol
Will you still love me
Mim7               Sim              Re
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Sol
Will you still love me
Mim7               Sim           Re
When I got nothing but my aching soul?
           Sol              Mim7
I know you will, I know you will
                Sim    Re
I know that you will
               Sol                 Mim          Sim
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

              Sol           Mim7
I've seen the world, lit it up
      Sim
As my stage now
      Sol         Mim7       Sim
Channeling angels in the new age now
           Sol            La
Hot summer days, rock 'n' roll
            Sim                 Re
The way you play for me at your show
            Sol           La
And all the ways I got to know
            Sim               Re
Your pretty face and electric soul

Sol
Will you still love me
Mim7               Sim              Re
When I'm no longer young and beautiful?

           Sol              Mim7
I know you will, I know you will
                Sim    Re
I know that you will
               Sol                 Mim7         Sim
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

     Sol                 Mim7
Dear lord, when I get to heaven
       Sim             Re6
Please let me bring my man
        Sol                       Mim7
When he comes tell me that you'll let him in
       Sim            Re6
Father tell me if you can
        Mim7           Sol
Oh that grace, oh that body
        Sim                 La
Oh that face makes me wanna party
        Mim7             Sol           Do
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds
