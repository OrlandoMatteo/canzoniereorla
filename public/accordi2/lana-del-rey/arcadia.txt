My body is a map of L.A.
                         Solm
I stand straight like an angel, with a halo
La#                       Rem
Hangin' out the Hilton Hotel window
            Solm
Screamin', "Heyo, baby, let's go"
Re#              La#       Fa
My chest, the Sierra Madre
Re#             La#         Fa
My hips, every high and byway
         Dom                         Fa
That you trace with your fingertips like a Toyota
Dom                     Fa
Run your hands over me like a Land Rover

[Chorus]
       La#         Fa
In Arcadia, Arcadia
                    Solm
All roads that lead to you as integral to me as arteries
Re#            La#               Dom              Fa
That pump the blood that flows straight to the heart of me
La#           Rem
America, America
                 Solm            Fa         Re#       La#
I can't sleep at home tonight, send me a Hilton Hotel
     Dom           La#          Fa
Or a cross on the hill, I'm a lost little girl
        La#
Findin' my way to ya

My body is a map of L.A.
                     Solm
And my heart is like paper, I hate ya
    La#                       Rem                       Solm
I'm not from the land of the palms, so I know I can't stay here

I'm not native, but
Re#               La#        Fa
My curves, San Gabriel all day
Re#                   La#             Fa
And my lips like the fire licks the bay
       Dom                            Fa
If you think that you know yourself, you can come over
Dom                        Fa
Lay your hands on me like you're a Land Rover

       La#         Fa
In Arcadia, Arcadia
                    Solm
All roads that lead to you as integral to me as arteries
Re#            La#               Dom              Fa
That pump the blood that flows straight to the heart of me
La#                    Rem
America, I need a miracle
                 Solm            Fa         Re#       La#
I can't sleep at home tonight, send me a Hilton Hotel
     Dom           La#          Fa

They built me up three hundred feet tall just to tear me down
       Re#           La#          Dom            Fa
So I'm leavin' with nothing but laughter, and this town

Findin' my way to ya

I'm leavin' them as I was, five foot eight
Re#             La#            Dom
Western bound, plus the hate that they gave
La#          Dom               Fa                La#
By the way, thanks for that, on the way, I'll pray for ya
                       Rem
But you'll need a miracle
