It was 9-29,9-29 back street big city
    Lam7                           Sim7
The sun was going' down, there was music all around
           Mim7
It felt so right

It was one of those nights, one of those nights when
             Sim7                Lam7
you feel the world stop turnin', you were standing
                Sim7
There,there was music in the air
  Domaj7
I should have been
            Do/Re
Away, but I knew I'd have to stay

Sol            Domaj7   Sol           Domaj7
 Last train to London, just headin' out,
Sol            Domaj7  Sim7           Lam7
 Last train to London, just leavin' town
      Solmaj7                  Domaj7
But I really want tonight to last forever
  Solmaj7                 Domaj7
I really wanna be with you
Sim7                  Lam7            Mim7
Let the music play on down the line tonight

It was one of those nights, one of those nights when
     Sim7                          Lam7
You feel the fire is burnin', everybody was there,
     Sim7                     Mim7
Everybody to share,it felt so right

There you were on your own, lookin' like you were
    Sim7               Lam7
The only one around, I had to be with you,
        Sim7
Nothin' else that I could do,
  Domaj7                         Do/Re
I should have been away, but I knew I'd have to say

Underneath a starry sky, time was still but hours
     Sim7                     Lam7
Must really have rushed by, I didn't realize
    Sim7                    Domaj7
But love was in your eyes I really should have
          Do/Re
Gone, but love went on and on...
