 Hey woman, you got the blues
Mim7    Lam           Mim7   Rem7
â€˜cause you ain't got no one else to use
Mim7       Lam    Mim7      Rem7
 There's an open road that leads nowhere,

So just make some miles between here and there
Mim7       Lam        Mim7           Rem7          Mim7
 There's a hole in my head where the rain comes in

 You took my body and played to win
Lam      Mim7         Rem7

 Rolled in from another town
Mim7     Lam       Mim7   Rem7
Hit some  gold too hot to settle down
Mim7    Lam          Mim7       Rem7
  But a fool and his money soon go separate ways
Mim7 Lam            Mim7      Rem7
      And you found a fool lyin' in a daze
Mim7 Lam      Mim7           Rem7
     Ha, ha - woman what you gonna do
Mim7   Lam            Mim7             Rem7
You destroyed all the virtues that the Lord gave you
Mim7 Lam      Mim7             Rem7
      It's so good that you're feeling pain
Mim7    Famaj7           Sol
