       Do  Fa  Do  Fa

Do         Fa      Do          Fa
  A day once dawned and it was beautiful
Do        Fa                 Sol7sus4   Do
  A day once dawned from the ground
                 Fa    Do               Fa
Then the night she fell and the air was beautiful
Do             Fa         Sol7sus4   Do
 The night she fell all around
           Fa          Do
So look, see the days
          Fa               Do
The endless coloured ways
         Fa                   Sol7sus4
And go play the game that you learned
         Do       Fa  Do  Fa  Do
From the morning
       Fa      Do          Fa
And now we rise and we are everywhere
Do       Fa               Sol7sus4   Do
 And now we rise from the ground
        Fa       Do           Fa
And see she flies, and she is everywhere
Do        Fa         Sol7sus4   Do
  See she flies all around
           Fa            Do
So look, see the sights
           Fa             Do
The endless summer nights
      Fa                      Sol7sus4
And go play the game that you learned
         Do      Fa  Do  Fa
From the morning
