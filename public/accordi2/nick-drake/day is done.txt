Rem              La7/Do#
 When the day is done
Fa/Do           Sol/Si
 Down to earth then sinks the sun
La#6
 Along with everything that was lost and won
La#6 La#7        La7sus4 La7
 When the day is done
Rem              La7/Do#  Fa/Do
 When the day is done
                      Sol/Si
Hope so much your race will be all run
La#6              Rem
 Then you find you jumped the gun
La#6            Rem
 Have to go back where you began
La#7  La7        Rem
 When the day is done

               La7/Do#    Fa/Do
When the night is cold
                Sol/Si        La#6
Some get by but some get old
                    Rem
Just to show life's not made of gold
La#6       La#7     La7sus4  La7
  When the night is cold
Rem            La7/Do#
 When the bird has flown
Fa/Do          Sol/Si        La#6
 Got no-one to call your own
           Rem
Got no place to call your home
La#6      La7sus4 La7 Rem       La7/Do#  Fa/Do  Sol7/Si
 When the bird      has flown

 When the game's been fought
                  Sol/Si            La#6
You speed the ball across the court
                        Rem
Lost much sooner than you would have thought
La#6     La#7    La7sus4      La7
 Now the game's been fought
Rem               La7/Do#      Fa/Do
 When the party's through
             Sol/Si        La#6
Seems so very sad for you
                  Rem                 La#7
Didn't do the things you meant to do
                    Rem
Now there's no time to start anew
La#6     La7sus4 La7 Rem
 Now the party's   through
           La7/Do#    Fa/Do
When the day is done
               Sol/Si            La#6
Down to earth then sinks the sun
                      Rem
Along with everything that was lost and won
La#7       La7sus4 La7 Rem
  When the day    is done
