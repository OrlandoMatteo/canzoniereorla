 Betty came by on her way
                         Sol#
Said she had a word to say
                  Do
About things today
                  Dom
And fallen leaves
                           Re#9
Said she hadn't heard the news
                         Sol#
Hadn't had the time to choose
              Do
A way to lose
                  Dom
But she believes
                          Re#9
Going to see the river man
                          Sol#
Going to tell him all I can
                Doadd9
About the plan
               Dom9
For lilac time
                        Re#9
If he tells me all he knows
                          Sol#
About the way his river flows
                    Do
And all night shows
              Do7sus4
In summertime

Sol#    Do    Sol#    Do

 Betty said she prayed today
                         Sol#
For the sky to blow away
               Doadd9
Or maybe stay
                Dom9
She wasn't sure
                                  Re#9
For when she thought of summer rain
                          Sol#
Calling for her mind again
                  Doadd9
She lost the pain
                    Dom9
And stayed for more
                         Re#9
Going to see the river man
                          Sol#
Going to tell him all I can
               Doadd9
About the ban
                 Dom9
On feeling free
                          Re#9
If he tells me all he knows
                          Sol#
About the way his river flows
                Do7sus4
I don't suppose
                 Do9
It's meant for me
Do9                       Dom9
Oh, how they come and go
              Doadd9    Do7sus4
Oh, how they come and go
