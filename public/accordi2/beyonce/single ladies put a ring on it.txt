All the single ladies (all the single ladies)

All the single ladies (all the single ladies)

All the single ladies (all the single ladies)

All the single ladies

Now put your hands up

Up in the club, we just broke up

I'm doing my own little thing

You decided to dip but now you wanna trip

'Cause another brother noticed me

I'm up on him, he up on me

Don't pay him any attention

'Cause I cried my tears

For three good years

Ya can't be mad at me

              Mi
'Cause if you like it then you should have put a ring on it

If you like it then you should've put a ring on it

Don't be mad once you see that he want it

If you like it then you should've put a ring on it

Wuh uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh

Wuh uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh

                               Domaj7
'Cause if you like it then you should have put a ring on it
       Si5              La5
If you like it then you should've put a ring on it
         Si5          Domaj7
Don't be mad once you see that he want it

I got gloss on my lips, a man on my hips

Hold me tighter than my Dereon jeans

Acting up, drink in my cup

I can't care less what you think

I need no permission, did I mention

Don't pay him any attention

'Cause you had your turn

And now you gonna learn

What it really feels like to miss me

'Cause if you like it then you should have put a ring on it

If you like it then you should've put a ring on it

Don't be mad once you see that he want it

If you like it then you should've put a ring on it

Wuh uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh

Wuh uh oh uh uh oh oh uh oh uh uh oh

Lam                     Mim
Don't treat me to these things of the world
    Lam
I'm not that kind of girl
     Mim                             Lam
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
                  Mim
Here's a man that makes me then takes me
     Domaj7                          Si
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond

Pull me into your arms

Say I'm the one you want
       Si7
If you don't, you'll be alone

And like a ghost I'll be gone

        Mi
All the single ladies (all the single ladies)
