That D'USSÃ‰ is the shit if I do say so myself

If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself

Hold up,

Stumbled all in the house time to back up all of that mouth

That you had all in the car,

talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far

Talking 'bout you be repping that third,

I wanna see all the shit that I heard

Know I sling Clint Eastwood,

hope you can handle this curve

Foreplay in the foyer, fucked up my Warhol

Slip the panties right to the side

Ain't got the time to take draws off, on site

Catch a charge I might, beat the box up like Mike

In '97 I bite, I'm Ike, Turner, turn up

Baby no I don't play, now eat the cake, Anna Mae

Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"

I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights you gonna need G3

4, 5, 6 flights, sleep tight

We sex again in the morning,

your breastases is my breakfast

We going in, we be all night
