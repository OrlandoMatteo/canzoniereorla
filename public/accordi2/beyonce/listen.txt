[<pre>La       Mi
Listen
       Fa#m             Do#m7
To the song here in my heart
  Re                  Mi
A melody I start but can't complete
La       Mi
Listen (mmm)
       Fa#m             Do#m7
To the sound from deep within
     Re                    Mi
It's only beginning to find release

        Do
Oh, the time has come 
    Mi7
For my dreams to be heard
Lam                   Sol
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Fa                                   Mi 
Into your own, all 'cause you wonâ€™t listen


La
Listen 
                Mi
I am alone at a crossroads
                      Fa#m
I'm not at home in my own home 
         Mi
And I've tried and tried 
       Re
To say what's on my mind 
Mi
You should have known 

La                          Mi
Oh, now I'm done believing you 

You don't know what I'm feeling 
    Re/Fa#               Mi/Sol#
I'm more than what you made of me 
  Do#m7                Fa#m
I found the voice you gave to me 
Re/La                      Mi
But now I've got to find my own 


                La         Mi
You should have listened
         Fa#m            Do#m7
There is someone here inside
    Re                              Mi
Someone I thought had died so long ago 

        Do
Oh, I'm screamin out
Mi7
And my dreams will be heard
Lam                    Sol
They will not be pushed aside or worse
Fa                                   Mi 
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen


La
Listen 
                Mi
I am alone at a crossroads
                      Fa#m
I'm not at home in my own home 
         Mi
And I've tried and tried 
       Re
To say what's on my mind 
Mi
You should have known 

La                          Mi
Oh, now I'm done believing you 

You don't know what I'm feeling 
    Re/Fa#               Mi/Sol#
I'm more than what you made of me 
  Do#m7                Fa#m
I found the voice you gave to me 
Re/La  
 La - Sol# - Sol - Fa# - Do


  Do                  Mi7
I don't know where I belong
    Lam              Sol
But I'll be moving on 
       Fa             Mi 
If you don't, if you won't


La       Mi
Listen 
       Fa#m             Do#m7
To the song here in my heart
  Re                    Mi
A melody I start but I will complete 


La                          Mi

    Re/Fa#               Mi/Sol#
I'm more than what you made of me 
  Do#m7                          Fa#m
I found the voice you think you gave to me 
Re/La                     Mi           La
But now I've got to find my own, my own
