If I were a boy
     Re             Mim    Do    Sol 
Even just for a day
Re               Mim         Do
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
  Sol           Re       Mim   Do    Sol
And throw on what I wanted and go
      Re             Mim   Do    Sol
Drink beer with the guys
    Re              Mim   Do   Sol   Re
And chase after girls
         Mim            Do
I'd kick it with who I wanted
        Sol             Re
And I'd never get confronted for it
Mim             Do            Sol
  'Cause they'd stick up for me


   Re          Mim   Do    Sol
If I were a boy
          Re         Mim   Do   Sol   Re
I think I could understand
       Mim              Do
How it feels to love a girl
  Sol            Re         Mim  Do   Sol
I swear I'd be a better man
    Re           Mim   Do    Sol
I?d listen to her
        Re            Mim  Do   Sol   Re
Cause I know how it hurts
         Mim               Do
When you lose the one you wanted
           Sol             Re
Cause he's taken you for granted
    Do
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
        Re              Mim    Do    Sol    Re
I would turn off my phone
     Mim            Do
Tell everyone it's broken
        Sol             Re      Mim   Do   Sol
So they think that I was sleeping alone
    Re             Mim    Do    Sol 
I'd put myself first
             Re          Mim   Do    Sol    Re
And make the rules as I go
        Mim              Do                 
Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Sol            Re          Mim   Do    Sol    
Waiting for me to come home

 Lam7       Do          Sol       Re       Lam
    It's a little too late for you to come back
         Do         Mim
Say it's just a mistake
           Re             Lam
Think I forgive you like that
          Do              Mim         Re
If you thought I would wait for you
            Do
You thought wrong


                  Mim   Do    Sol
But you're just a boy
          Re       Mim        Do        Sol    Re
You don't understand (yea you don't understand)
         Mim              Do
How it feels to love a girl, someday you'll
Sol              Re               Mim   Do   Sol
Wish you were a.. better man
            Re        Mim   Do   Sol
You don't listen to her
          Re             Mim   Do   Sol
You don't care how it hurts
Re           Mim             Do
  Until you lose the one you wanted
                Sol                 Re
