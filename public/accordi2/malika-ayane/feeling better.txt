  As far as I can see
                      Re#m
it's too much freedom for me
                   Sol#
That's the way you like it. Ah-ah
Do#                    La#m
  If she's so happy to be
                  Re#m
It's never enough for me
                     Sol#
And that's the way I like it. Ah-ah ah-ah
Do#               La#m
  You taste humility
              Re#m
Without a referee
                    Sol#
That's the way they like it. Ah-ah ah-ah
Do#             La#m
  And no commodities
               Re#m
Not even a cup of tea
                    Sol#
That's the way they like it, oooh

Do#               Fa#
  Keep on feeling better
Sol#                 Do#
Love be pleased and stay
               Fa#
Really doesn't matter
             Do#
Wake me up today
         Fa#  Sol#
Da da da da...

Do#  La#m  La  Sol#

Do#               La#m
  The particles I breathe
                   Re#m
The remedy I never need
                   Sol#
That's the way you like it. Ah-ah
Do#                 La#m
  The scent of modesty
                     La#m
The judge that walks in peace
                    Sol#
That's the way they like it, oooh

Do#               Fa#
  Keep on feeling better

  Not even when I run on pride
La                             Sol#
  I'll change and rearrange my kind
