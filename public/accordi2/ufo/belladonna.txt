 Oh Belladonna never knew the pain

Maybe I'm crazy, maybe it'll drive you insane
                    Mim                Do
The open letter just carelessly placed
                       Lam
And you move in silence, the tea so delicately laced

Rem      Sol   Do      Lam    Rem
  Out of reach, out of touch
           Sol                Lam
How you've learned to hate so much
Rem      Sol   Do      Lam    Rem
  Out of reach, out of touch
           Sol                Lam
How you've learned to hate so much

Rem  Sol  Do  Lam  Rem  Sol

Lam                       Mim              Do
 Came from passion, and you gave it a name

The fingers are poisoned like needles
               Rem   Rem/Si Lam
in the drivin' rain
                          Mim                    Do
So smile discreetly as you watch with such grace
                          Lam
Now I must slip away, but can you forget my face

Rem      Sol   Do      Lam    Rem
  Out of reach, out of touch

How you've learned to hate so much
