      Do    Lam    Fa    Do
      Oh....

              Mim/Si    Lam
Somethin’ filled up
                      Fa
my heart with nothin’
                       Do
Someone told me not to cry
                    Mim/Si Lam
But now that I’m older,
                   Fa
my heart’s colder,
                          Do
and I can see that it’s a lie
Do    Lam    Fa    Do
Oh...

                 Mim/Si Lam
Children, wake up
                      Faadd9
Hold your mistake up
                                 Do
before they turn the summer into dust
                            Mim/Si Lam
If the children don’t grow up,
                                                 Fa
our bodies get bigger but our hearts get torn up

We’re just a million little gods causin' rain storms,
                            Do
turnin’ every good thing to rust
                             Do    Lam   Fa   Do
I guess we’ll just have to adjust...

Re#                       Do
With my lightnin’ bolts a glowin’,
Re#                        Fa
I can see where I am goin’ to be
                                          Do
when the reaper he reaches and touches my hand

Do   Lam   Fa   Do

Do   Lam   Fa   Do

Do                        Lam
With my lightnin’ bolts a glowin’,
                Fa         Do
I can see where I am goin’
                          Lam
With my lightnin’ bolts a glowin’,
                Fa               Do
I can see where I am go -- goin’!

You better look out below!
