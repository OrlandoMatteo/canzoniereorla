  In the suburbs I
               La
I learned to drive
        Re                    Sim   Fa#
And you told me we'd never survive
                   La
Grab your mother's keys we're leavin'

Re  Sim  Fa#  La

Your part of town gets minor

But by the time the first bombs fell

We were already bored
                 La
We were already, already bored

               La
And all of the walls that they built
       Re                 Sim9   Fa#

And all of the houses they build
       Re                 Sim9

 So can you understand?

Why I want a daughter while I'm still young
        Fa#m9
I wanna hold her hand

And show her some beauty
  Re                   Sim   Fa#m9
Before this damage is done

But if it's too much to ask,

Re             Sim   Fa#
 Under the overpass
               La
In the parking lot we're still waiting
     Re             Sim  Fa#
It's already passed

So move your feet from hot pavement
    Re            Sim
and into the grass
           Fa#
Cause it's already passed
