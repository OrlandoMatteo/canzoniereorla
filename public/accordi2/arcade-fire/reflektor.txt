Sim                        Fa#m
 Trapped in a prison, in a prism of light
Sim                       Fa#m
 Alone in the darkness, a darkness of white
Re6               La6
We fell in love, alone on a stage,
   Sim
in the reflective age
                  Fa#m
Entre la nuit, la nuit et l'aurore
Sim                  Fa#m
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts
Re6                   La6
 If this is heaven, I don't know what it's for
   Sim
If I can't find you there, I don't care

  Mim       Re                   Sim
I thought I found a way to enter

it was just a reflector (Just a reflector)
  Mim       Re                   Sim
I thought I found the connector

it was just a reflector (Just a reflector)

        Sim                   Fa#m
Now the signals we send are deflected again
Sim                      Fa#m
 We're so connected, but are we even friends?
Re6                  La6
We fell in love when I was 19,
              Sim
and now we're staring at a screen
                  Fa#m
Entre la nuit, la nuit et l'aurore
Sim                   Fa#m
 Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts
Re6                 La6
 If this is heaven, I need something more
       Sim
Just a place to be alone, cause you're my home

  Mim       Re                   La/Do# Sim

Sim
 It's just a reflector, just a reflector
Fa#
 Just a reflector, reflector
Sim                   Si   Mi  Sol
 Just a reflector...

         Si
Just a reflection of a reflection

of a reflection of a reflection of a reflection (ah!),
                           Mi
but I see you on the other side
                     Mim    Sol
We all got things to hide
         Si
Just a reflection of a reflection

of a reflection of a reflection of a reflection (ah!),
                           Mi
but I see you on the other side
                     Mim    Sol

(Alright let's go back)

Sim                  La/Si
Our song it skips on little silver disks
Sim                            Sim9
 Our love is plastic, and they break it to bits
Sim
 I want to break free,
Sim9
 but will they break me
Sim
down, down down, don't mess around
