       Do

                Do/La#
And then you're black again
              Do
Can't make it back again
        Do/La#
We cant just pretend
          Fa
Will make all again
                Do
From everything now

Fa   Do   Sol   Fa   Do   Sol

              Fa
Every inch of sky's got a star
              Do
Every inch of skin's got a scar
                        Sol
I guess that you've got everything now
              Fa
Every inch of space in your head
                       Do
Is filled up with the things that you read
                   Sol
I guess you've got everything now
                    Fa
And every film that you've ever seen
                  Do
Fills the spaces up in your dreams

That reminds me
 Sol
(Everything now)

(Everything now)
              Fa
Every inch of road's got a sign
              Do
And every boy uses the same line
                       Sol
I pledge allegiance to everything now
                Fa
Every song that I've ever heard
                    Do
Is playing at the same time, it's absurd
                             Sol
And it reminds me, we've got everything now
                     Fa
We turn the speakers up till they break
                      Do
'Cause every time you smile it's a fake

Stop pretending, you've got...
 Sol
(Everything now!) I need it

(Everything now!) I want it
 Faadd9
(Everything now!) I can't live without

(Everything now!) I can't live without
 Do
(Everything now!)

(Everything now!)
               Sol
Everything now

Fa   Do   Sol   Fa   Do   Sol

              Fa
Every inch of road's got a town
                 Do
Daddy, how come you're never around?
                Sol
I miss you, and everything now
                Fa
Mama, leave the food on the stove
                      Do
Leave your car in the middle of the road
                       Sol
This happy family with everything now
                     Fa
We turn the speakers up till they break
                      Do
'Cause every time you smile it's a fake

Stop pretending, you've got...

(Everything now!) I need it

(Everything now!) I can't live without

(Everything now!) I can't live without
 Do
(Everything now!)
                             Sol
(Everything now!) 'Til every room in my house

(Everything now!) Is filled with shit
                                     Faadd9
(Everything now!) I couldn't live without

(Everything now!) I need it
                                   Do
(Everything now!) I can't live without

(Everything now!)

Everything now

La la la la la, la la la

(Everything now!) I can't live without

(Everything now!) I can't live without
 Sol
(Everything now!) I can't live
                            Faadd9
(Everything now!) And every room in my house

(Everything now!) Is filled with shit
                                      Do
(Everything now!) I couldn't live without

(Everything now!) I need it
                                  Sol
(Everything now!) I can't live without

(Everything now!) I can't live
                                Faadd9
(Everything now!) Every inch of space

(Everything now!) In my heart

(Everything now!) Is filled with
           Do
something I'll never start
             Sol
The ashes of everything now

                Faadd9
And then you're black again
              Do
Can't make it back again
                Sol
From everything now
