you could have a steam train

if you'd just lay down your tracks

you could have an aeroplane flying

if you bring your blue sky back

                     Re#
I'll be anything you need

you could have a big dipper

going up and down, all around the bends

you could have a bumper car, bumping

this amusement never ends
