Si Fa#/Si Si                        Fa#/Si Si
           Climbing up on Solsbury Hill
                     Sol#m Fa# Sol#m
I could see the city light
                              Fa# Sol#m
Wind was blowing, time stood still
                       Si Fa#/Si Si
Eagle flew out of the night
                           Fa#/Si Si
He was something to observe
                         Sol#m Fa# Sol#m
Came in close, I heard a voice
                               Fa# Sol#m
Standing stretching every nerve
                       Mimaj7
I had to listen had no choice
Fa#/Mi    Mimaj7
I did not believe the information
Fa#/Mi   Mimaj7            Do#m9
Just had to trust imagination
Fa#       Do#m9
My heart going boom boom, boom
    Fa#      Do#m7
Son,    he said
          Si/Re#       Mi      Fa#      Mi/Si  Si
Grab your things, I've come to take you home

Mi/Si Si Fa#          Mi/Si Si   Mi/Si Si Fa#
           Eh, don't quit

Si Fa#/Si Si                           Fa#/Si Si
           To keeping silence I resigned
                               Sol#m Fa# Sol#m
My friends would think I was a nut
                        Fa# Sol#m
Turning water into wine
                         Si Fa#/Si Si
Open doors would soon be shut
                          Fa#/Si Si
So I went from day to day
                        Sol#m Fa# Sol#m
Though my life was in a rut
                             Fa# Sol#m
'till I thought of what I'd say
                          Mimaj7
Which connection I should cut
  Fa#/Mi         Mimaj7
I was feeling part of the scenery
Fa#/Mi      Mimaj7                 Do#m9
I walked right out of the machinery
Fa#           Do#m9
My heart was going boom boom boom
     Fa#      Do#m7
Hey,    he said
          Si/Re#       Mi      Fa#      Mi/Si Si
Grab your things, I've come to take you home
Mi/Si Si Fa#         Mi/Si Si   Mi/Si Si Fa#
           Yeah back home

Si Fa#/Si Si                         Fa#/Si Si
           When illusion spin her net
                          Sol#m Fa# Sol#m
I'm never where I want to be
                         Fa# Sol#m
And liberty she pirouette
                       Si Fa#/Si Si
When I think that I am free
                         Fa#/Si Si
Watched by empty silhouettes
                                 Sol#m Fa# Sol#m
Who close their eyes, but still can see
                            Fa# Sol#m
No one taught them etiquette
                    Mimaj7
I will show another me
      Fa#/Mi  Mimaj7
Today I don't need a replacement
          Fa#/Mi        Mimaj7             Do#m9
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
   Fa#     Do#m9
My heart going boom boom boom
    Fa#       Do#m7
Hey,    I said
                Si/Re#
You can keep my things,
        Mi      Fa#     Mi/Si Si   Mi/Si Si Fa#
they've come to take me home

Mi/Si Si   Mi/Si Si Fa#
