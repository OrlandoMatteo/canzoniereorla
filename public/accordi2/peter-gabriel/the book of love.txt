 The book of love is long and boring
Sol#/Do      Do#      Re#7/La#   Sol#
 No one can lift the damn thing
Sol#/Do        Do#        Re#       Fam7
 It's full of charts and facts and figures
Sol#/Do   Do#          Re#7 Sol#
 And instructions for dan--cing

    Sol# Do#/Sol#  Re#7/Sol# Sol#
But I...

I love it when you read  to me

  You  can read me    anything

 The book of love has music in it
         Do#           Re#7sus4  Sol#
In fact that's where music comes from
Sol#/Do    Do#       Re#     Fam
 Some of it is just transcendental
Sol#/Do   Do#        Re#7   Sol#
 Some of it is just really dumb

    Sol# Do#/Sol#  Re#7/Sol# Sol#
But I...
        Do#/Sol#    Re#7/Sol# Sol#
I love it when you sing  to me

  You  can sing me    anything

 The book of love is long and boring
Sol#/Do       Do#   Re#     Sol#
 And written very long ago
Sol#/Do      Do#           Re#          Fam7
 It's full of flowers and heart-shaped boxes
Sol#/Do            Do#     Re#7sus4   Sol#
 And things we're all too young to know

    Sol#/Do Do#  Re# Fam7
But I...
Sol#/Do   Do#        Re#7sus4  Sol#
 I love it when you give me things
    Sol#/Do Do#  Re# Fam7
And you...
Sol#/Do     Do#       Re#7     Sol#
 You ought to give me wedding rings
