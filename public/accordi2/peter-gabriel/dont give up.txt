I was taught to fight, taught to win

I never thought I could fail
Dom
no fight left or so it seems
       La#       Re#               Sol# Re#
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted
               La#
I've changed my face, I've changed my name
           Dom
but no one wants you when you lose

drove the night toward my home
                     Re#          Re#4 Re#
the place that I was born, on the lakeside
            La#
as daylight broke, I saw the earth

the trees had burned down to the ground

where we belong

keep my eyes down below
   Re#
whatever may come
       La#
and whatever may go
          Re#        La#
that river's flowing
          Re#
that river's flowing

Dom
moved on to another town
              Re#
tried hard to settle down
          La#
for every job, so many men
