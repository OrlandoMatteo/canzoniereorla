[<pre>Mim             Lam    Mim
My lover's got humour
                       Lam     Sol
She's the giggle at a funeral
                       Lam     Mim
Knows everybody's disapproval
                            Lam    Mim
I should've worshipped her sooner
                     Lam     Mim
If the Heavens ever did speak
                     Lam      Sol
She is the last true mouth piece
                        Lam      Mim
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
                Lam    Re
A fresh poison each week
                   Do                      Mim
'We were born sick, you heard them say it

                      Lam    Mim
My church offers no absolutes
                             Lam    Sol
She tells me 'worship in the bedroom'
                         Lam   Mim
The only heaven I'll be sent to
                   Lam   Re
Is when I'm alone with you
               Do
I was born sick, but I love it

Command me to be well
Sol      Do     Sol       Do    Sol      Dom Sol   Sol Fa#  Fa# Fa
Aaaaaaaaa    aaaaaaaaamen. Aaaaaaaamen. Amen

              Mim
Take me to church
                                               Si7
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
                                                Sol
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
                 Lam
Offer me that deathless death
 Mim                   Lam Sol Sol Fa#  = power chords
Good God, let me give you my life


Mim                     Lam
If I'm a pagan of the good times
Mim                Lam
My lover's the sunlight
Sol                    Lam
To keep the Goddess on my side
Mim               Lam
She demands a sacrifice
Re
To drain the whole sea
Do
Get something shiny

Mim                      Lam            Mim
Something meaty for the main course
                       Lam          Sol
That's a fine looking high horse
                    Lam        Mim
What you got in the stable?
                         Lam
We've a lot of starving faithful
Re
That looks tasty
Do
That looks plenty
Do
This is hungry work

Good God, let me give you my life


Do            Sol                Si7           Mim
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
        Do            Sol             Si7           Mim
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
        Do            Sol          Si7           Mim
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
     Do         Sol
Only then I am human
     Si7            Mim    Re    Do
Only then I am clean
 Sol   Do Sol    Dom Sol    Dom Sol    Sol Fa#  Fa# Fa
Oh, A- men. A- men. A- men
