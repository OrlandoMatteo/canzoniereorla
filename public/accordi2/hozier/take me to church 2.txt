Mim             Lam    Mim
 My lover's got humour
                      Lam     Sol
She's the giggle at a funeral
                       Lam    Mim
Knows everybody's disapproval
                           Lam    Mim
I should've worshipped her sooner

If the heavens ever did speak
                    Lam         Sol
She's the last true mouthpiece
                       Lam        Mim
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
               Lam       Re
A fresh poison each week
                    Do
"We were born sick,"  you heard them say it

Mim                  Lam    Mim
 My church offers no absolutes
                              Lam    Sol
She tells me, "Worship in the bedroom"
                        Lam     Mim
The only heaven I'll be sent to
                  Lam       Re
Is when I'm alone with you
                Do
I was born sick

But I love it

Command me to be well
   Sol Do Sol Do Sol Dom Sol
Aaay   A--men A--men A---men

I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
              Lam
Offer me that deathless death

 If I'm a pagan of the good times
               Lam     Sol
My lover's the sunlight
                       Lam     Mim
To keep the Goddess on my side

Something meaty for the main course

What you got in the stable?
                        Lam       Re
