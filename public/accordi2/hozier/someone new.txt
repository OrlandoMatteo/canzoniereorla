Sol              Sol/Si Do        Re
 Don't take this the    wrong way,
    Mim      Re         Sim7              Do
You knew who I was with every step that I ran to you,
Sol        Sol/Si  Do        Re
 Only blue or    black days,
  Mim          Re                 Sol        Do
Electing strange perfections in any stranger I choose
Do7            Sim7                    Mim
 Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Fa/Sol          Do7
Honey, there is no right way

         Sol                    Sol/Si
And so I fall in love just a little,
            Do                     Re
oh a little bit every day with someone new
  Sol                    Sol/Si

Sol                   Sol/Si     Do   Re
 There's an art to life's distractions,
        Mim         Re
To somehow escape the burning weight,
    Sim7        Do
the art of scraping through,
Sol        Sol/Si  Do    Re
 Some like to   imagine,
    Mim        Re
The dark caress of someone else,
  Sol       Do
I guess any thrill will do
Do7            Sim7                    Mim

  Lam                         Mim
I wake at the first cringe of morning,
Do7     Si7             Mim
 And my heart's already sinned
    Do7               Si7
How pure, how sweet a love, Aretha,
     Mim
that you would pray for him
                   Lam
'Cause God knows I fall in love just a little,

oh, a little bit every day with someone new
