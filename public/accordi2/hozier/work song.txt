La#5                  Do5
 Boys workin' on empty
   La#5                                     Do5
Is that the kinda way to face the burning heat?
La#5                       Do5
 I just think about my baby
    La#5
I'm so full of love I could barely eat
                                    Do5
There's nothing sweeter than my baby
    La#5                              Do5
I'd never want once from the cherry tree
La#5                          Do5
 Cause my baby's sweet as can be
      La#5
She'd give me toothaches just from kissin' me

Solm    Fa                   La#
 When my   time comes around
                               Dom
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
Solm          Fa
 No grave can hold my body down
La#
 I'll crawl home to her

La#5                        Do5
 Boys, when my baby found me
La#5                            Do5
I was three days on a drunken sin
La#5                            Do5
 I woke with her walls around me
La#5
Nothin' in her room but an empty crib
                            Do5
And I was burnin' up a fever
  La#5                         Do5
I didn't care much how long I lived
La#5                              Do5
 But I swear I thought I dreamed her
    La#5
She never asked me once about the wrong I did

Solm    Fa                   La#
 When my   time comes around
                               Dom
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
Solm          Fa
 No grave can hold my body down
La#
 I'll crawl home to her
Solm    Fa                   La#
 When my   time comes around
                               Dom
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
Solm          Fa
 No grave can hold my body down
La#
 I'll crawl home to her

La#5                        Do5
 My babe would never fret none
 La#5                             Do5
About what my hands and my body done
La#5                         Do5
 If the Lord don't forgive me
    La#5
I'd still have my baby and my babe would have me
                            Do5
When I was kissin' on my baby
    La#5                            Do5
And she put her love down soft and sweet
La#5                        Do5
 In the low lamp light I was free
La#5
Heaven and hell were words to me

Solm    Fa                   La#
 When my   time comes around
                               Dom
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
Solm          Fa
 No grave can hold my body down
La#
 I'll crawl home to her
Solm    Fa                   La#
 When my   time comes around
                               Dom
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
Solm          Fa
 No grave can hold my body down
La#
 I'll crawl home to her
