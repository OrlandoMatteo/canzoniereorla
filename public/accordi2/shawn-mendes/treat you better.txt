Lam      Sol         Fa
I won't lie to you
            Lam        Sol           Fa
I know he's just not right for you
            Lam
And you can tell me if I'm off
       Sol       
But I see it on your face
          Fa
When you say that he's the one that you want
            Lam
And you're spending all your time
        Sol
In this wrong situation
     Fa
And anytime you want it to stop

 
             Lam        Sol     Fa
I know I can treat you better
            Do  
Than he can
                  Lam    Sol       Fa         Do  
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
                    Lam
Tell me why are we wasting time
                 Sol
On all on your wasted crying
                Fa            Do
When you should be with me instead
             Lam        Sol     Fa
I know I can treat you better
Do
Better than he can


Lam         Sol          Fa
I'll stop time for you
               Lam        Sol         Fa
The second you say you'd like me to
Lam                          Sol      
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Fa
Baby, just to wake up with you
         Lam                        Sol                
Could be everything I need and this could be so different
Fa
Tell me what you want to do


                   Lam        Sol     Fa
Cause I know I can treat you better 
           Do
Than he can
                  Lam     Sol      Fa          Do 
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
                   Lam
Tell me why are we wasting time
               Sol
On all on your wasted crying
                Fa            Do
When you should be with me instead
              Lam       Sol     Fa
I know I can treat you better  
Do
Better than he can


Lam Sol Fa Do
       Better than he can
Lam Sol Fa Do


Lam        Sol
Give me a sign
        Do              Fa
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Lam        Sol             Fa
Promise I won't let you down
     Lam            Sol
Just know that you don't
        Do         Fa
Have to do this alone
Lam           Sol             Fa
Promise I'll never let you down


                   Lam        Sol     Fa    
Cause I know I can treat you better
            Do
Than he can
                  Lam     Sol      Fa         Do
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
                   Lam
Tell me why are we wasting time
               Sol
On all on your wasted crying
                Fa              Do
When you should be with me instead
              Lam       Sol     Fa
I know I can treat you better

Better than he can

Lam Sol Fa Do
       Better than he can
