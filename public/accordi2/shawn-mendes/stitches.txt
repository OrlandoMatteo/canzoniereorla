[<pre> Lam             Sol               Do        Fa
I thought that I've been hurt before
    Lam              Sol                 Do  Fa
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
 Lam              Sol             Do     Fa
Your words cut deeper than a knife
      Lam                Sol           Do     Fa
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life



 Fa                       Sol 
Got a feeling that I'm going under
 Lam
But I know that I'll make it out alive
 Fa                Sol
If I quit calling you my lover
Lam
Move on



              Lam                   Sol
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
           Do                    Fa
I'm shaking, falling onto my knees
             Lam                 Sol
And now that I'm without your kisses
 Fa                 Do
I'll be needing stitches
       Lam           Sol
I'm tripping over myself,
             Do                   Fa
I'm aching begging you to come help
       Lam                      Sol
And now that I'm without your kisses
   Fa                Do
I'll be needing stitches


  Lam         Sol               Do     Fa
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
          Lam             Sol            Do    Fa
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
 Lam           Sol                Do           Fa
Your bitter heart cold to the touch
               Lam          Sol
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
                Do            Fa
I'm left seeing red on my own


 Fa                       Sol 
Got a feeling that I'm going under
 Lam
But I know that I'll make it out alive
