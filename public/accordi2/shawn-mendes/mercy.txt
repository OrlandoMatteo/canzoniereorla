Mim          Sol
  You've got a hold of me
Sim             La
  Don't even know your power
Mim       Sol
  I stand a hundred feet
Sim                La
  But I fall when I'm around you


Mim       Sol
  Show me an open door
Sim                  La
  Then you go and slam it on me
Mim      Sol
 I can't take anymore
Sim           La
 I'm saying baby


             Mim         Sol
Please have mercy on me
        Sim          La
Take it easy on my heart
                       Mim             Sol
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
          Sim          La
You keep tearing me apart
                     Mim     Sol     Sim      La
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart
                     Mim     Sol     Sim      La
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart


Mim      Sol
 I'd drive through the night
Sim           La
 Just to be near you baby
Mim        Sol
 Heart open, testify
Sim            La  
 Tell me that I'm not crazy


Mim             Sol
 I'm not asking for a lot
Sim                 La
 Just that you're honest with me
Mim       Sol
 My pride is all I got
Sim           La
 I'm saying baby


             Mim         Sol
Please have mercy on me
        Sim          La
Take it easy on my heart
                       Mim             Sol
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
          Sim          La
You keep tearing me apart
                       Mim         Sol
Would you please have mercy on me
       Sim               La
I'm a puppet on your string
                         Mim              Sol   
And even though you got good intentions
       Sim             La
I need you to set me free
                     Mim     Sol     Sim      La
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart
                     Mim     Sol     Sim      La
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart


    Sol              Sim7
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
 Re                La
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
Sol                Sim7
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
          Re            La
I would gladly do it twice
    Mim              Sim7
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
 Re                La
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
Mim                Sim7
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
          Re            La
I would gladly do it twice


             Mim         Sol
Please have mercy on me
        Sim          La
Take it easy on my heart
                       Mim             Sol
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
          Sim          La
You keep tearing me apart
                       Mim         Sol
Would you please have mercy on me
       Sim               La
I'm a puppet on your string
                         Mim              Sol   
And even though you got good intentions
       Sim             La
I need you to set me free
                   Mim     Sol     Sim      La
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy on my heart
                   Mim     Sol     Sim      La
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy on my heart
