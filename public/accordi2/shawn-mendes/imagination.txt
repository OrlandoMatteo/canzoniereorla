Oh, there she goes again, every morning it's the same,
             Do                    Sol
You walk on by my house, I wanna call out your name.
Lam                      Fa                             Do
I wanna tell you how beautiful you are from where I'm standing,
             Sol
You got me thinking what we could be 'cause


Lam
I keep craving, craving you,
Fa
You don't know it but it's true,
Do                         Sol
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you.
Lam                   Fa
This is typical of love,
                           Do                   
Can't wait anymore, I won't wait I need to tell ya 
                 Sol
how I feel when I see us together forever.


        Do                 Sol
In my dreams, you're with me,
         Fa                         Sol
We'll be everything I want us to be.
         Do               Sol
And from there, who knows?
        Fa                             Sol
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss,
For the first time.

Lam                                   Fa
We walked, we laughed, we spent our time, walking by the ocean side,
Do                        Sol
My hands are gently intertwined, a feeling I just can't describe.
Lam                        Fa                              Do
All this time we spent alone, thinking we could not belong,
                         Sol                   Lam
To something so damn beautiful, so damn beautiful.
