I'd sit alone and watch your light
   Solm7
My only friend through teenage nights
    La#
And everything I had to know
  Solm7          La# Fa
I heard it on my radio

You gave them all those old-time stars
        Solm7
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
    La#
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
    Solm7             La#      Fa  Solm/Fa Fa
You made us feel like we could fly
    Fa
So, don't become some background noise
  Fam6/Sol#
A backdrop for the girls and boys
    La#
Who just don't know or just don't care
    Sim7b5
And just complain when you're not there
    Fa/Do
You had your time, you had the power
       Do7
You've yet to have your finest hour

Radio, someone  still  loves you

   Fa
We watch the shows, we watch the stars
  Solm7
On videos for hours and hours
   La#
We hardly need to use our ears
    Solm7         La#         Fa
How music changes through the years

Let's hope you never leave, old friend
    Fam6/Sol#
Like all good things on you we depend
    La#
So, stick around 'cause we might miss you
    Sim7b5
When we grow tired of all this visual

You've yet to have your finest hour
