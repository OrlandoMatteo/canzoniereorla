[<pre>           Dom  Solm7/Do
I've paid my dues
           Dom  Solm7/Do
Time after time
           Dom     Solm7/Do
I've done my sentence
              Dom  Solm7/Do
But committed no crime
           Re#   Sol#/Re#
And bad mistakes
            Re#  Sol#/Re#
I've made a few
            Re#          La#/Re        Dom
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
    Fa7        La#
But I've come through
                 Sol#/Fa#   Sibm7b5  La#7    Do7
And I mean to go on, and on, and on, and on


Fa          Lam           Rem     La# Do7
We are the champions, my friends
    Fa             Lam              La#  Fa#dim7
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
Solm7        Do7/Sol       La#m6   La#m6/Do#   Midim7  Soldim7
We are the champions, we are the       cham - pions
Fa           Re#add9/Sol      Sol#6        La#       Dom7add4
No time for losers 'cause we are the champions
       Fam   Solm7   Fam   Solm7/Fa   Fam   Solm7/Do
Of the world


                Dom  Solm7/Do
I've taken my bows
               Dom  Solm7/Do
And my curtain calls
               Dom
You brought me fame and fortune
                    Solm7/Do
And everything that goes with it
            Dom  Solm7/Do
I thank you all
                        Re#  Sol#/Re#
But it s been no bed of roses
            Re#  Sol#/Re#
No pleasure cruise
                Re#
I consider it a challenge
           La#/Re        Dom
Before the whole human race
    Fa7            La#
And I ain't gonna lose
                 Sol#/Fa#   Sibm7b5  La#7     Do7
And I mean to go on, and on, and on, and on


Fa          Lam            Rem     La# Do7
We are the champions, my friends

And we'll keep on fighting till the end
