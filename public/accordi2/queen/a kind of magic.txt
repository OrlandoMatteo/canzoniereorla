It's a kind of magic

A kind of magic

    La
One dream, one soul,
    Si/La
One prize, one goal
    Remaj7             La
One golden glance of what should be

It's a kind of magic
                        Siadd9
One shaft of light that shows the way
   Remaj7           La
No mortal man can win this day

It's a kind of magic
                      Si7
The bell that rings inside your mind
   Remaj7            La
Is challenging the doors of time

It's a kind of magic
    Fa#m           Re
The waiting seems eternity
    Fa#m             Mi7
The day will dawn of sanity

There can be only one
     Mi        Sol     Re
This rage that lasts a thousand years
             Mi
Will soon be done

     La                 Siadd9
This flame that burns inside of me
    Remaj7           La
I'm hearing secret  harmonies

It's a kind of magic
                      Si7
The bell that rings inside your mind
 Remaj7              La
Is challenging the doors of time
