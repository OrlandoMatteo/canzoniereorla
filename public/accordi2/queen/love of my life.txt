Love of my life - you've hurt me,
       Sim                  Mi         Mi7
You've broken my heart and now you leave me.

Bring it back, bring it back,
      Sol        Re              Sol     Re   Sim    Mim    La           Re 
Don't take it away from me, because you don't know, what it means to me.

You will remember - When this is blown over

When I grow older I will be there at your side to remind you

How I still love you - still love you.

Hurry back - hurry back,

Please bring it back home to me,
  Sol     Re   Sim    Mim   La                Re
