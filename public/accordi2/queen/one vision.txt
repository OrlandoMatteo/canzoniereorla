 I had a dream,
            Do6/Re
When I was young,
        Sol        Do   Re
A dream of sweet illusion,
             Sol
A glimpse of hope and unity,
    Do6/Re           Sol
And visions of one sweet union,

      La#/Re
But a cold wind blows,
      Do/Re
And a dark rain falls,
          La#/Do
And in my heart it shows,
Do/Re                        La#/Re
Look what they've done to my dream
