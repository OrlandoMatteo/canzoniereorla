 Sometimes I get to feeling
      Fa/Do       Do  Fa           La#/Fa Fa
I was back in the old days long ago
Do
 When we were kids, when we were young
Fa/Do   Do        Fa              La#/Fa Fa
 Things seemed so perfect You know?
Do/Sol
 The days were endless, we were crazy, we were young
Sol
 The sun was always shining We just lived for fun
Rem7
 Sometimes it seems like lately

I just don't know
Lam                                Sol
 The rest of my life's been just a show

Do             Sol/Si Lam7 Sol Faadd9
Those were the days   of   our lives
    Do            Sol/Si Do   Sol Faadd9
The bad things in life   were so  few
      Do   Rem Do  Sol/Si Lam7
Those days are all gone   now,
Sol La#   Do7sus4 La#  Fa/La
But   one thing is true
       Do/Sol     Sol          Fa
When I look and I find I still love you

Do
 You can't turn back the clock,
          Fa/Do         Do    Fa
You can't turn back the tide
                   La#/Fa Fa   Do
 Ain't that a shame?
                                  Fa/Do   Do        Fa
I'd like to go back one time on a roller-coaster ride
                     La#/Fa  Fa   Do/Sol
When life was just a game

No use sitting and thinking on what you did
Sol
 When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Rem7
 Sometimes it seems like lately
                    Lam
I just don't know
                                Sol
Better sit back and go with the flow

       Do            Sol/Si Lam7 Sol Faadd9
'Cause these are the days   of   our lives
        Do           Sol/Si Do Sol Faadd9
They've flown in the swiftness of  time
      Do   Rem Do  Sol/Si Lam7
Those days are all gone   now,
Sol La#   Do7sus4  La# Fa/La
But  some things  remain
       Do/Sol     Sol     Faadd9
When I look and I find no change

Rem   Lam   Mim7   La#add9  Lam  Sol

Rem   Lam   Mim7   La#add9  Lam  Sol

Do             Sol/Si Lam7 Sol Faadd9
Those were the days   of   our lives
    Do            Sol/Si Do   Sol Faadd9
The bad things in life   were so  few
      Do   Rem Do  Sol/Si Lam7
Those days are all gone   now,
Sol La#   Do7sus4 La#  Fa/La
But   one thing is true
       Do/Sol     Sol  Faadd9
When I look and I find I still love you
Do
 I still love you
