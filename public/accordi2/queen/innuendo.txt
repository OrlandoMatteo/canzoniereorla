Mi                           Famaj7        Mi              Famaj7
  While the sun hangs in the sky and the desert has sand
Mi                             Famaj7     Mi            Famaj7
  While the waves crash in the sea and  meet the land
Sol#                           Lamaj7          Sol#    Lamaj7
  While there's a wind and the stars and the rainbow

  While we rule by blind madness and pure  greed
Sol#                            Lamaj7     Sol#                Lamaj7
  Our lives dictated by tradition, superstition, false religion

Mi                                        Famaj7      Mi   Famaj7
  If there's a God or any kind of justice under the sky
Mi                                 Famaj7      Mi          Famaj7
  If there's a point, if there's a reason to live or die
Lamaj7                                    Lamaj7     Sol#         Lamaj7

Sol#                        Lamaj7       Sol#            Lamaj7
Show yourself - destroy our fears -  release your mask

  Yes we'll keep on tryin'
Do#               Mi   Si
  Tread that fine line
