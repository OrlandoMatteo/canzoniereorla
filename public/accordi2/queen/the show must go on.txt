Empty spaces - what are we living for
          Sol
abandoned places - I guess we know the score
Mim             Fa#                      Mim
on and on, does anybody know what we are looking for?
        Sim
Another hero, another mindless crime
           Sol
behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Mim                 Fa#                     Mim
hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore?

                 Sim                  Sol
The show must go on, the show must go on, yeah,
  Mim
inside my heart is breaking
   Fa#
my make-up may be flaking
       Mim   Mim7    Sim
but my smile   still stays on.

        Do#m
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
        La
another heartache, another failed romance
Fa#m            Sol#                     Fa#m
on and on, does anybody know what we are living for?
            Do#m
I guess I'm learning, I must be warmer now,
             La
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now
   Fa#m
outside the dawn is breaking
    Sol#                          Fa#m       Mim
but inside in the dark I'm aching to be free.

  My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies

fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die

I can fly - my friends.

I'll face it with a grin
    Fa#
I'm never giving in
  Mim           Mim7  Sim
on with the show.

I'll top the bill, I'll overkill,
Fa#                              Mim
I have to find the will to carry on (with the show, with..)
Mim
Show...
                 Sim
The show must go on.
