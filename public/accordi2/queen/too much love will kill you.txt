     Sol  Do/Sol  Sol  Mim  Re

             Sol           Do            Sol
I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be;
    Re/Fa#  Mim              Re              Do   Do/Si
Too many    bitter tears are raining down on me.
     Lam           Mim
I am far away from home,
              Lam          Mim
And I've been facing this alone
             Re4   Re   Do/Re   Do/Re
For much too long...    Oh

            Sol         Do                Sol
I feel like no-one ever told the truth to me
         Re/Fa#  Mim           Re                Do   Do/Si
About growing    up and what a struggle it would be.
      Lam              Mim
In my tangled state of mind,
          Lam             Mim
I've been looking back to find
             Re4   Re   Do/Re   Do/Re
Where I went wrong.

Sol                Do
Too much love will kill you
       Mim                Re
If you can't make up your mind;
Sol              Do
Torn between the lover
        Mim              Re
And the love you leave behind.
       Sol/Si       Do
You're headed for disaster
         Sol/Re         Do#dim
'Cos you never read the signs:
Sol                Doadd9
Too much love will kill you
      Sol  Do/Sol  Sol  Mim  Re
Every time.

             Sol           Do            Sol
I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be,
    Re/Fa#  Mim              Re                  Do   Do/Si
And it      seems there's no way out of this for me.
  Lam               Mim
I used to bring you sunshine;
    Lam        Mim
Now all I ever do
             Re4   Re   Do/Re   Do/Re
Is bring you down.      Ooh-ooh

             Sol            Do             Sol
How would it be if you were standing in my shoes?
      Re/Fa#  Mim             Re          Do      Do/Si
Can't you     see that it's impossible to choose?
    Lam            Mim
Oh, there's making sense of it:
Lam         Mim
Every way I go
             Re4   Re   Do/Re   Do/Re
I'm bound to lose.      Oh-ooh

Sol                Do
Too much love will kill you
         Mim            Re
Just as sure as none at all.
      Sol                    Do
It'll drain the power that's in you,
         Mim                  Re
Make you bleed and scream and crawl.
        Sol/Si             Do
And the pain will make you crazy;
           Sol/Re         Do#dim
You're the victim of your crime.
Sol                Doadd9
Too much love will kill you
      Sol  Do/Sol  Sol  Mim  Re
Every time.

Strumentale (accordi della strofa):
     Sol  Do  Sol  Re/Fa#  Mim  Re  Do  Do/Si

     Lam  Mim  Lam  Mim  Re4  Re  Do/Re  Do/Re

      Sol                Do
Yeah, too much love will kill you;
      Mim              Re
It'll make your life a lie.
     Sol               Do
Yes, too much lo-ooove will kill you
        Mim              Re
And you won't understand why.
        Sol/Si
(You'd) give your life,
      Do
You'd sell your soul,
    Sol/Re        Do#dim
But here it comes again:
Sol                Doadd9
Too much love will kill you,
       Sol  Do/Sol  Sol  Mim  Re
In the end.
        Sol  Do/Sol  Sol  Mim  Re
I-i-i-i-in the end.
