Mim                    Sol
No one knows what it's like
          Re     Re4
to be the bad man
          Doadd9
to be the sad man
  Lasus2
behind blue eyes

Mim                    Sol
No one knows what it's like
      Re    Re4
to be hated
      Doadd9
to be fated
   Lasus2
to telling only lies

       Do     Re
But my dreams
               Sol
they aren't as empty
      Do         Re       Mi
as my conscience seems to be
       Sisus2         Do
I have hours, only lonely
              Re     Re4
my love is vengeance
            Lasus2
thats never free

Mim                    Sol
No one knows what it's like
              Re      Re4
to feel these feelings
       Doadd9
like I do
            Lasus2
and I blame you

Mim                  Sol
No one bites back as hard
         Re    Re4
on their anger
           Doadd9
none of my pain and woe
           Lasus2
can show through

       Do     Re
But my dreams
               Sol
they aren't as empty
      Do         Re       Mi
as my conscience seems to be
       Sisus2         Do
I have hours, only lonely
              Re     Re4
my love is vengeance
            Lasus2
thats never free

Mi             Sisus2       La       Mi
  When my fist clenches, crack it open
Mi         Sim        Sol      Re
  Before I use it and loose my cool
       Sisus2    La           Re
When I smile, tell me some bad news
         Sim       La         Mi    Sim  La
Before I laugh and act like a fool
Mi         Sisus2     La       Mi
  And if I swallow anything evil
         Sim    Sol     Re
Put your finger down my throat
         Sisus2            La        Re
And if I shiver, please give me a blanket
        Sim          La        Mi
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat
