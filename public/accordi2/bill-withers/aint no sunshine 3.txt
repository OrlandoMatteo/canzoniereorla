                          Lam7     Mim7 Sol7 Lam7
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
                                Mim7 Sol7 Lam7
It's not warm when she's away
                             Mim7
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
                          Rem7
And she's always gone too long
                  Lam7   Mim7 Sol7 Lam7
Anytime she goes away
                       Lam7        Mim7 Sol7 Lam7
Wonder this time where she's gone
                               Mim7 Sol7 Lam7
Wonder if she's gone to stay
                              Mim7
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
                              Rem7
And this house just ain't no home
                  Lam7   Mim7 Sol7 Lam7
Anytime she goes away

And I know, I know, I know, I know

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

I know, I know


Hey, I gotta leave young thing alone
                              Lam7      Mim7 Sol7 Lam7
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone
                                   Mim7 Sol7 Lam7
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
                          Mim7 Sol7 Lam7
Only darkness every day
                             Mim7
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
                             Rem7
And this house just ain't no home
                  Lam7   Mim7 Sol7 Lam7
Anytime she goes away
                  Lam7   Mim7 Sol7 Lam7
Anytime she goes away
                  Lam7   Mim7 Sol7 Lam7
Anytime she goes away-------------
