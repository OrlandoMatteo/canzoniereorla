     Re                      Sol
It's hard to remember how it felt before
 La7                         Re
Now I found the love of my life
                        Sol
Passes things, get more comfortable
 La7                 Sol
Everything is going right
                   La
And after all the obstacles
             Remaj7                           Sol
It's good to see you now with someone else
                La
And it's such a miracle that
Remaj7
you and me are still good friends
      Sol                 La
After all that we've been through
                  Re
I know we're cool
                  Sol  La7
I know we're cool

Re                        Sol
We used to think it was impossible
        La7                     Re
Now you call me by my new last name
                      Sol
Memories seem like so long ago
 La7                  Sol
Time always kills the pain
                La
Remember Harbor Boulevard
    Remaj7                                  Sol
The dreaming days where the mess was made
                 La
Look how all the kids have grown, oh
Remaj7
We have changed but we're still the same
      Sol                 La
After all that we've been through
                  Re
I know we're cool
                  Sol  La7
I know we're cool
Re                        Sol  La7
  Yeah, I know we're cool

Sol               La
 And I'll be happy for you
   Remaj7                     Sol
If you can be happy for me
            La
Circles and triangles
              Remaj7
And now we're hanging out with your new girlfriend
   Sol                  La
So far from where we've been
                   Re
I know we're cool
                   Sol  La7
I know we're cool
        Re                  Sol  La7
See-cool, I know we're cool
Re                     Sol  La7
  ...I know we're cool
Re                     Sol  La7
  ...I know we're cool
