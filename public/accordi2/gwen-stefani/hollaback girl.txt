Uh huh, this my shit

All the girls stomp your feet like this

A few times I've been around that track

So it's not just gonna happen like that

'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl

I ain't no hollaback girl

Si  Simaj7    Si            Simaj7
 Oh, this my shit, this my shit

I heard that you were talking shit

And you didn't think that I would hear it

People hear you talking like that,

getting everybody fired up

So I'm ready to attack, gonna lead the pack

Gonna get a touchdown, gonna take you out

That's right, put your pom-poms down,

getting everybody fired up

A few times I've been around that track

So it's not just gonna happen like that

'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl

I ain't no hollaback girl

Gonna make you fall, gonna sock it to you
