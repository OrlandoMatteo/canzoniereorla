       Do#m  Si6  Lamaj7  Sol#7  Do#m  Si6  Lamaj7  Sol#7

Do#m                     Si6
 Feel the vibe, feel the terror, feel the pain
     Lamaj7         Sol#
It's driving me insane
Do#m              Si6
 I can't fake for God's sake, why am I
Lamaj7                 Sol#7
Driving in the wrong lane
Do#m          Si6
Trouble is my middle name
           Lamaj7            Sol#7
But in the end I'm not too bad
    Do#m     Si6            Lamaj7
Can someone tell me if it's wrong to be
     Sol#7   Do#m  Si6
So mad about you,
 Lamaj7 Sol#7  Do#m Si6  Lamaj7  Sol#7
mad    about you,     mad

Do#m               Si6
 Are you the fishy wine who will give me
Lamaj7              Sol#
A headache in the morning
Do#m                 Si6
 Or just a dark blue land mine
           Lamaj7                  Sol#7
That'll explode without a decent warning
Do#m             Si6
Give me all your true hate
              Lamaj7           Sol#7
And I'll translate it in our bed
     Do#m                Si6
Into never seen passion, never seen passion
Lamaj7
That's why I am
     Sol#7   Do#m  Si6
So mad about you,
 Lamaj7 Sol#7  Do#m Si6  Lamaj7  Sol#7
mad    about you,     mad

Fa#m
 Trouble is your middle name
           Sol#7
But in the end you're not too bad
    Fa#m                    Sol#7
Can someone tell me if it's wrong to be
              Do#m  Si6
So mad about you,
 Lamaj7 Sol#7  Do#m Si6  Lamaj7  Sol#7
mad    about you,     mad
       Do#m  Si6
about you,
 Lamaj7 Sol#7  Do#m Si6  Lamaj7  Sol#7
mad    about you,     mad

   Do#m  Si6  Lamaj7  Sol#7  Do#m  Si6  Lamaj7  Sol#7

   Do#m  Si6  Lamaj7  Sol#7  Do#m  Si6  Lamaj7  Sol#7

Fa#m
 Give me all your true hate
              Sol#7
And I'll translate it in your bed
     Fa#m
Into never seen passion
        Sol#7
That is why I am
              Do#m  Si6
So mad about you,
 Lamaj7 Sol#7  Do#m Si6  Lamaj7  Sol#7
mad    about you,     mad
       Do#m  Si6
about you,
 Lamaj7 Sol#7  Do#m Si6  Lamaj7  Sol#7
mad    about you,     mad
       Do#m  Si6
about you,
 Lamaj7 Sol#7  Do#m Si6  Lamaj7  Sol#7
mad    about you,     mad
       Do#m  Si6  Lamaj7  Sol#7
about you,
