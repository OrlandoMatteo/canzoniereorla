Who are you to wave your finger?

You must have been out your head

Eye hole deep in muddy waters

You practically raised the dead

Rob the grave to snow the cradle

Then burn the evidence down

Soapbox, house of cards and glass,

So don't go tossin' your stones around

You must have been high

You must have been high
                   Rem
You must have been

Rem
Foot in mouth and head up asshole

So what you talkin' 'bout?

Difficult to dance 'round this one

'Til you pull it out, boy!

You must have been so high

You must have been so high
