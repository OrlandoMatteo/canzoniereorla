Rem
There's a shadow just behind me,
Rem6
Shrouding every step I take,
Rem
Making every promise empty,
Rem6
Pointing every finger at me
Rem
Waiting like a stalking butler
Rem6
Who upon the finger rests
Rem
Murder now the path of "must we"
Rem6
Just because the son has come
Rem
Jesus, won't you fucking whistle
Re#
Something but the past is done?

Rem
I am just a worthless liar
Rem6
I am just an imbecile
Rem
I will only complicate you
Rem6
Trust in me and fall as well
Rem
I will find a center in you
Re#
I will chew it up and leave,
Rem
I will work to elevate you
Re#
Just enough to bring you down

Re5
Mother Mary, won't you whisper
Re#5
Something but the past is done?
