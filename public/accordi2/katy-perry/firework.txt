[<pre>Sol Lam Mim Do


Sol                Lam   
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag, 
Mim                        
drifting through the wind 
Do                    
wanting to start again? 
Sol                Lam                 
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin 
Mim                      
like a house of cards,
Do                       
one blow from caving in? 
Sol                Lam                  
Do you ever feel already buried deep? 
Mim                        Do                            
6 feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing 
Sol                        Lam                     
Do you know that there's still a chance for you 
Mim                             
'Cause there's a spark in you 
Do
You just gotta


  Sol          Lam         Mim     Do 
Ignite, the light, and let it shine 
     Sol       Lam             Mim        Do
Just own the night like the 4th of July 


                      Sol    Lam
'Cause baby you're a firework
                   Mim           Do
Come on, show 'em what you're worth 
             Sol          Lam
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh" 
                        Mim    Do
As you shoot across the sky-y-y 
               Sol    Lam
Baby, you're a firework 
                   Mim     Do
Come on, let your colors burst 
             Sol          Lam
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh" 
                        Mim              Do
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe


Sol                     Lam
You don't have to feel like a waste of space 
Mim             Do
You're original, cannot be replaced 
Sol               Lam
If you only knew what the future holds 
Mim                      Do
After a hurricane comes a rainbow 

Sol                     Lam
Maybe your reason why all the doors are closed 
Mim                       Do
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road 
Sol                     Lam
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will blow 
Mim                       
And when it's time, you'll know 
Do
You just gotta


Sol          Lam          Mim     Do 
Ignite, the light, and let it shine 
     Sol       Lam             Mim        Do
Just own the night like the 4th of July 


                      Sol    Lam
'Cause baby you're a firework
                   Mim           Do
Come on, show 'em what you're worth 
             Sol          Lam
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh" 
                        Mim    Do
As you shoot across the sky-y-y 
               Sol    Lam
Baby, you're a firework 
                   Mim     Do
Come on, let your colors burst 
             Sol          Lam
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh" 
                        Mim              Do
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
 

Mim
Boom, boom, boom       
                      Do
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon 
                           Sol
It's always been inside of you, you, you 
                            Re
And now it's time to let it through-ough-ough 


                      Sol    Lam
'Cause baby you're a firework
                   Mim           Do
Come on, show 'em what you're worth

Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh" 
                        Mim    Do
As you shoot across the sky-y-y 
               Sol    Lam
Baby, you're a firework 
                   Mim     Do
Come on, let your colors burst 
             Sol          Lam
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh"

You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
