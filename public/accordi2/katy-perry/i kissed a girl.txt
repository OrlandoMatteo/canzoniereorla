This was never the way i planned,
    Fa       Mi
not my intention.
Lam        Do              Rem  
I got so brave, drink in hand,
     Fa       Mi
lost my discretion.
Lam            Do
It's not what i'm used to,
Rem    Fa          Mi
 Just want to try you on.
Lam       Do           Rem
 I'm curious, for you,
       Fa       Mi
Caught my attention.

I kissed a girl,
            Rem/La
and I liked it.
                 Fa/La        Mi/La
The taste of her cherry chapstick.

             Fa/La              Mi/La
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it.
Lam         Do
It felt so wrong,
           Rem
It felt so right.
               Fa       Mi
Don't mean i'm in love tonight.

No, I don't even know your name,
    Fa         Mi
It doesn't matter.
Lam        Do              Rem  
Your my experimental game,
     Fa       Mi
Just human nature.
Lam            Do
It's not what good girls do,
Rem   Fa             Mi   
Not how they should behave.
Lam          Do           Rem
My head gets so confused,
    Fa      Mi
Hard to obey.

Us girls we are so magical,

Soft skin, red lips, so kissable,
          Mim                Lam  
Hard to resist, so touchable.
          Sol
To good to deny it.
Rem           
 Ain't no big deal,
     
Its innocent.
