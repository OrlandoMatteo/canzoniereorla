I knew you were

You were gonna come to me

And here you are

But you better choose carefully

‘Cause I, I’m capable of anything

Of anything and everything

Make me your Aphrodite

Make me your one and only
                                                  Fa#
But don’t make me your enemy, your enemy, your enemy
             Do#           La#m
So you wanna play with magic
                Sol#                      Fa#
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
            Do#           La#m
Baby do you dare to do this?
                 Sol#                Fa#
Cause I’m coming at you like a dark horse
        Do#                La#m
Are you ready for, ready for
  Sol#                         Fa#
A perfect storm, perfect storm
      Do#                               La#m
Cause once you’re mine, once you’re mine

There’s no going back

La#m

La#m
Mark my words

This love will make you levitate

Like a bird

Like a bird without a cage

But down to earth

If you choose to walk away, don’t walk away

It’s in the palm of your hand now baby

It’s a yes or no, no maybe

So just be sure before you give it all to me
                            Fa#
All to me, give it all to me
             Do#           La#m

Uh

She’s a beast

I call her Karma (come back)

She eats your heart out

Like Jeffrey Dahmer (woo)

Be careful

Try not to lead her on

Shorty’s heart is on steroids

Cause her love is so strong

You may fall in love

When you meet her

If you get the chance you better keep her

She's sweet as pie but if you break her heart

She'll turn cold as a freezer

That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor

She can be my Sleeping Beauty

I’m gon’ put her in a coma

Woo!
Fa#
Damn I think I love her
                   Do#
Shorty so bad, I’m sprung and I don’t care
            La#m
She ride me like a roller coaster
           Sol#
Turned the bedroom into a fair (a fair!)
    Fa#
Her love is like a drug
      Do#
I was tryna hit it and quit it
         La#m
But lil' mama so dope
          Sol#                   Fa#
I messed around and got addicted

             Do#           La#m
