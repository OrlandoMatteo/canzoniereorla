Sol
 I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
                        Lam             Mim
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
                          Do       Sol
So I sit quietly, agree politely

I guess that I forgot I had a choice
                   Lam                     Mim
I let you push me past the breaking point
                                   Do
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything


    Sol
You held me down, but I got up
                 Lam
Already brushing off the dust
    Mim
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
                    Do
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
    Sol
You held me down, but I got up
                     Lam
Get ready cause I've had enough
  Mim
I see it all, I see it now


          Do           Sol
I got the eye of the tiger, the fighter,
                     Lam
Dancing through the fire
      Mim                                Do       Sol
Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
                       Lam
Louder, louder than a lion
      Mim                                Do       Sol
Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
                    Lam   Mim
Oh oh oh..., Oh oh oh..., Oh oh oh...
              Do       Sol   Solsus2
You're gonna hear me roar


Sol
 Now I'm floatin' like a butterfly
                      Lam               Mim
Stingin' like a bee I earned my stripes
                             Do
I went from zero, to my own hero


    Sol
You held me down, but I got up
                 Lam
Already brushing off the dust
    Mim
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
                    Do
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
    Sol
You held me down, but I got up
                     Lam
Get ready cause I've had enough

I see it all, I see it now


          Do           Sol
I got the eye of the tiger, the fighter,
                     Lam
Dancing through the fire
      Mim                                Do       Sol
Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
                       Lam
Louder, louder than a lion
      Mim                                Do       Sol
Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
                    Lam   Mim
Oh oh oh..., Oh oh oh..., Oh oh oh...
              Do       Sol
You're gonna hear me roar
                          Lam   
Oh oh oh..., (Hey) Oh oh oh..., 
             Mim
(You'll hear me roar) Oh oh oh...
              Do       Sol      Lam  Mim    Re
You're gonna hear me roar


    Re              Re Re Re Re
Roar, roar, roar, roar


N.C.                  Sol
I got the eye of the tiger, the fighter,

Oh oh oh..., Oh oh oh..., (Yeah) Oh oh oh...
              Do       Sol
You're gonna hear me roar
                     Lam                   Mim
Oh oh oh..., Oh oh oh..., (You'll hear me roar) 
Oh oh oh...
