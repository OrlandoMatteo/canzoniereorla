          Si
There's a stranger in my bed,
          Sol#m7
There's a pounding in my head
            Re#m7
Glitter all over the room
        Do#
Pink flamingos in the pool
        Si
I smell like a mini-bar
    Sol#m7
DJs passed out in the yard
        Re#m7
Barbies on the barbecue
       Do#
This a hickey or a bruise
         Si
Pictures of last night
      Sol#m7
Ended up online
      Re#m7
I'm screwed
    Do#
Oh, well
       Si
It's a blacked out blur
        Sol#m7          Re#m7
But I'm pretty sure it ruled
  Do#
Damn

            Si
Last Friday night
                         Sol#m7
Yeah, we danced on table tops
                     Re#m7
And we took too many shots
                         Do#
Think we kissed but I forgot
            Si
Last Friday night
                          Sol#m7
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
                          Re#m7
And got kicked out of the bar
                   Do#
So we hit the boulevard
            Si
Last Friday night
                         Sol#m7
We went streaking in the park
                      Re#m7
Skinny dipping in the dark
                    Do#
Then had a ménage à trois
            Si
Last Friday night
                           Sol#m7
Yeah, I think we broke the law
                       Re#m7  Do#
Always say we're gonna stop
            Si
This Friday night
       Sol#m7  Re#m  Do#
Do it all again

       Si
Trying to connect the dots
           Sol#m7
Don't know what to tell my boss
          Re#m7
Think the city towed my car
      Do#
Chandelier is on the floor
          Si
Ripped my favorite party dress
         Sol#m7
Warrants out for my arrest
        Re#m7
Think I need a ginger ale
         Do#
That was such an epic fail
         Si
