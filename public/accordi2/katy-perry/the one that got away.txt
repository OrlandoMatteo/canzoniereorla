[<pre>Mi
Summer after high school when we first met
Sol#m
We make out in you mustang to Radiohead
    Do#m                                     La
And on my 18th birthday we got matching tattoos
        Mi
Used to steal your parent's liquor and climb to the roof
Sol#m
Talk about our future like we had a clue
      Do#m                                La
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you


            Mi                   Sol#m
In another life I would be your girl
                Do#m                        La
We keep all our promises be us against the world
            Mi                    Sol#m
In another life I would make you stay
                   Do#m                            La
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away


Mi
I was June you were my Johnny Cash
      Sol#m
Never one without the other we made a pact
Do#m                                           La
Sometimes when I miss you I put those records on woah
Mi
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Sol#m
Saw you down town singinâ€™ the blues
     Do#m                                       La
It's time to face the music I'm no longer your muse


            Mi                   Sol#m
In another life I would be your girl
                Do#m                        La
We keep all our promises be us against the world
            Mi                    Sol#m
In another life I would make you stay
                   Do#m                            La
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
The one that got away


Mi         Sol#m         Do#m         La
  The one     the one     the one   the one that got away

Si                              Do#m        La
  All his money can't buy me a time machine no
Si                          Do#m         La
  Can't replace you with a million rings no
Si                             Do#m       La
  I shoulda told you what you meant to me woah
Si
  Cause now I pay the price


            Mi                   Sol#m
In another life I would be your girl
                Do#m                        La
We keep all our promises be us against the world
            Mi                    Sol#m
In another life I would make you stay
                   Do#m                            La
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away

The one that got away

Mi         Sol#m         Do#m         La
  The one     the one     the one

            Mi                    Sol#m
In another life I would make you stay
                   Do#m                            La
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away
                  Mi 
The one that got away</pre>]
