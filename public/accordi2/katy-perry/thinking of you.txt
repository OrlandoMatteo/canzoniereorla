[<pre>Mi              Si
Comparisons are easily done
Do#m                         La
Once you've had a taste of perfection
Mi                    Si
Like an apple hanging from a tree
Do#m
I picked the ripest one
La
I still got the seed

Mi
You said move on
          Si
Where do I go
Do#m
I guess second best
C     
Is all I will know


          Mi
Cause when I'm with him
Si
I am thinking of you
Do#m
Thinking of you
La
What  you  would do if
Mi
You were the one
Si
Who was spending the night
Do#m
Oh I wish that I
La
Was looking into your eyes

Mi Si Do#m La



              Mi
You're like an Indian summer
      Si
In the middle of winter
Do#m
Like a hard candy
La
With a surprise center
       Mi
How do I get better
Si
Once I've had the best
         Do#m
You said there's

Tons of fish in the water
      La
So the waters I will test

Mi
He kissed my lips
            Si
I taste your mouth
Do#m
He pulled me in
         La
I was disgusted with myself


          Mi
Cause when I'm with him
Si
I am thinking of you
Do#m
Thinking of you
La

What  you  would do if
Mi
You were the one
Si
Who was spending the night
Do#m
Oh I wish that I
La
Was looking into your...


Mi
The best
    Si       Do#m
And yes I do regret
            La   Mi
How I could let myself
Si       Do#m
Let you go
La                    Mi
Now Now the lesson's learned
Si                 Do#m              
I touched it I was burned
La          Mi
Oh I think you should know


          Mi
Cause when I'm with him
Si
I am thinking of you
Do#m
Thinking of you
La
What  you  would do if
Mi
You were the one
Si
Who was spending the night
Do#m
Oh I wish that I
La
Was looking into your...

Mi
Your eyes
                  Si
Looking into your eyes
                  Do#m
Looking into your eyes
La
Oh won't you walk through
Mi
And bust in the door and
Si
Take me away
   Do#m
Oh no more mistakes
      La            Mi   Si   Do#m   La
Cause in your eyes I'd like to stay</pre>]
