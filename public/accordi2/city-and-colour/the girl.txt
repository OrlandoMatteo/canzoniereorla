[<pre>Sol             Sol/Fa#  Mim      
I wish I could do better by you 
           Domaj7          Solmaj7/Re Sol
'cause that's what you deserve,
Sol                Sol/Fa# Mim        
You sacrifice so much of your life 
         Domaj7         Solmaj7/Re Sol
in order for this to work. 


Sol                                Sol/Fa#
While I'm out chasin' my own dreams,
Mim
Sailin' around the world,
       Domaj7               
Please know that I'm yours 
    Solmaj7/Re Sol
to keep, my beautiful girl.


Sol                        Sol/Fa# Mim  
When you cry, a piece of my heart dies,
        Domaj7    Solmaj7/Re   Sol
knowing I may have been the cause
Sol                    Sol/Fa# Mim    
If you were to leave, fulfill someone
                    Domaj7       Solmaj7/Re
else's dreams, I think I might totally
Sol
Be lost.


Sol                               Sol/Fa#
You don't ask for no diamond rings,
Mim
No delicate string of pearls,
Domaj7                          Solmaj7/Re  
That's why I wrote this song to sing,
               Sol
my beautiful girl.
