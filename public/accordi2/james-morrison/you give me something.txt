Do                            Sol
You only stay with me in the morning
Fa                        Sol7
You only hold me when I sleep
Lam                       Do
I was meant to tread the water
Fa                     Sol7
Now I've gotten in too deep
Lam                         Do
For every piece of me that wants you
Fa        Re/Fa#          Sol
Another piece backs away


Mim       Lam     Rem7            Sol7       Fa   Mim
Coz you give me something that makes me scared alright
      Lam       Rem7            Sol7        Fa         Mim
this could be nothing but I'm willing to give it a try
      Lam       Rem7            Sol7            Sol#         Do
Please give me something coz some day I might know my heart


Do                       Sol7
You only waited up for hours
Fa                                      Sol7
Just to spend a little time alone with me
Lam                                     Do
And I can say I've never bought you flowers
Fa                           Sol7
I can't work out what they mean
Lam                         Do
I never thought I'd love someone
Fa        Re/Fa#              Sol
that was someone else's dream...

Please give me something coz some day I might call you from my heart

But it might be a second too late
