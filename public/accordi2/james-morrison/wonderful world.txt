La#m                          Sol#
 I've been down so low people look at me and they know
         Fa#              Do#
They can tell something is wrong
     Fa#       Do#
Like I don't belong
   La#m
Well, staring through a window standing
   Sol#                                 Fa#
outside there just to happy to care tonight
                Do#          Fa#           Do#
I wanna be like them but I'll mess it up again
Sol#                                                     Sol#7
 I tripped on my way in, got kicked outside, everybody saw

      Fa#                       Do#
And I know that it's a wonderful world
                  Sol#
But I cant feel it right now
        Fa#                 Do#                   Sol#
Well, I thought I was doing well but I just want to cry now
       Re#m7                     La#m         Re#m  Mim         Fam
Well I know that its a wonderful world from the sky down to the sea
          La#m        Sol#         Fa#            Do#   Fa
But I can only see it when you're here, here with me

La#m                                 Sol#
 Sometimes I feel so full of love it just comes spilling out
       Fa#             Do#          Fa#       Do#
It's uncomfortable to see I give it away so easily
La#m                             Sol#
 But if I had someone I would do anything
                                          Fa#
I'd never never never never let you feel alone
  Do#          Fa#               Do#
I wont, I wont leave you on your own
Sol#
 Who am I to dream, dreams are for fools, they let you down

      Fa#                       Do#
And I know that it's a wonderful world
                  Sol#
But I cant feel it right now
        Fa#                 Do#                   Sol#
Well, I thought I was doing well but I just want to cry now

But I can only see it when you're here, here with me

Lamaj7     Do#               Si      Lamaj7
   And I wish that I could make it better
         Si     Fa#         Do#
I'd give anything for you to call me
             Si     Lamaj7
Maybe just a little letter
             Re#m7  Sol#
Oh it could start again

      Fa#                       Do#
