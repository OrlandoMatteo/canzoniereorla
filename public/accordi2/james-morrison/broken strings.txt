[<pre>       Lam
Let me hold you
        Do
For the last time
         Fa
It's the last chance to feel again
        Lam
But you broke me
      Do             Fa      Rem
Now I can't feel anything
       Lam
When I love you,
        Do
It's so untrue
  Fa
I can't even convince myself
         Lam
When I'm speaking,
         Do                Fa    Rem
It's the voice of someone else


      Fa     Sol  Lam
Oh it tears me up
  Fa           Sol          Mim
I try to hold on, but it hurts too much
  Fa         Sol            Mim           Fa           Do
I try to forgive, but it's not enough to make it all okay


          Rem             Lam
You can't play on broken strings
          Do       Sol 
You can't feel anything 
          Rem                  Lam
That your heart don't want to feel
        Do                             Sol
I can't tell you something that ain't real
       Fa     
Oh the truth hurts
    Lam  
And lies worse
Do                 Sol
How can I give anymore
       Rem                Lam       Sol
When I love you a little less than before


        Lam     Do
Oh what are we doing
       Fa
We are turning into dust
        Lam           Do        Fa    Rem
Playing house in the ruins of us
        Lam               Do
Running back through the fire
             Fa
When there's nothing left to save
          Lam               Do                  Fa    Rem
It's like chasing the very last train when it's too late


      Fa     Sol  Lam
Oh it tears me up
  Fa           Sol          Mim
I try to hold on, but it hurts too much
  Fa         Sol              Mim           Fa         Do
I try to forgive, but it's not enough to make it all okay

When we both know it's too late (too late)

Well the truth hurts
