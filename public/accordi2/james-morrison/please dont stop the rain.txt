       Lam  Do  Rem  Lam Sol

Lam                               Do
 I don't know where I crossed the line
       Rem
Was it something that I said
   Lam             Sol   Lam
Or didn't say this time
                                Do
And I don't know if it's me or you
          Rem
But I can see the skies are changing
   Lam               Sol    Famaj7
In all the shades of blue
                                Sol
And I don't know which way it's gonna go

Do                         Famaj7
 If it's gonna be a rainy day
                                      Lam
There's nothing we can do to make it change
                      Sol7
We can pray for sunny weather
                        Do
But that won't stop the rain
                                  Famaj7
Feeling like you got no place to run
                                 Lam
I can be your shelter 'til it's done
                        Sol7
We can make this last forever
                         Do
So please don't stop the rain
                      Famaj7
(Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall)
                       Lam
Please don't stop the rain
                      Sol7
(Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall)
                       Lam
Please don't stop the rain

                        Sol/Si  Do
I thought that time was on our side
            Rem
I've put in far too many years
   Lam              Sol   Do
To let this pass us by
                   Sol/Si Do
You see life is a crazy thing
            Rem
There'll be good time and there'll be bad times
    Lam              Sol   Famaj7
And everything in between
                              Sol
And I don't know which way it's gonna go

Do                         Famaj7
 If it's gonna be a rainy day
                                      Lam
There's nothing we can do to make it change
                      Sol7
We can pray for sunny weather
                        Do
But that won't stop the rain
                                  Famaj7
Feeling like you got no place to run
                                 Lam
I can be your shelter 'til it's done
                        Sol7
We can make this last forever
                         Do
So please don't stop the rain
                      Famaj7
(Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall)
                       Lam
Please don't stop the rain
                      Sol7
(Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall)
                       Rem
Please don't stop the rain

           Do            Sol   Lam7
Oh we're a little closer now
Rem        Do               Sol
In finding what life's all about
Lam7   Rem                 Lam7
Yeah I know you just can't stand it
   Do                   Sol
If things don't go your way
Fa                                             Sol
 But we've got no control over what happens anyway

Do                         Famaj7
 If it's gonna be a rainy day
                                      Lam
There's nothing we can do to make it change
                      Sol7
We can pray for sunny weather
                        Do
But that won't stop the rain
                                  Famaj7
Feeling like you got no place to run
                                 Lam
I can be your shelter 'til it's done
                        Sol7
We can make this last forever
                         Do
So please don't stop the rain
                      Famaj7
(Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall)
                       Lam
Please don't stop the rain
                      Sol7
(Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall)
                       Do
Please don't stop the rain

(Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall)
                     Famaj7
Can't stop it, can't stop it,
                         Lam
just can't stop the rain

(Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall)
       Sol                          Do
Let it fall, please don't stop the rain
