[<pre>          Mi
And so it is
                     Laadd9
Just like you said it would be
             Siadd11
Life goes easy on me
Laadd9      Mi
Most of the time
    Mi
And so it is
          Laadd9
The shorter story
          Siadd11
No love, no glory
          Do#m
No hero in her sky


        La
I can't take my eyes off of you
           Sol#m
I can't take my eyes off you
           Fa#m
I can't take my eyes off of you
           Mi
I can't take my eyes off you
           Laadd9            Siadd11
I can't take my eyes off you
           Laadd9     Laadd9  Siadd11  Mi                    
I can't take my eyes...


Mi
And so it is
        Mi                Laadd9     
Just like you said it should be
        Laadd9                Siadd11
We'll both forget the breeze
Laadd9       Mi
Most of the time
Mi
And so it is
Mi                Laadd9
The colder water
Laadd9                 Siadd11
The blower's daughter
        Do#m
The pupil in denial


          Laadd9
I can't take my eyes off of you
           Sol#m
I can't take my eyes off you
           Fa#m
I can't take my eyes off of you
           Mi
I can't take my eyes off you
           Laadd9             Siadd11
I can't take my eyes off you
           Laadd9           Siadd11                       
I can't take my eyes...

    
Fa#
Oooooooooohh
Fa#              Sisus2
Did I say that I loathe you?
                Sol#m  
Did I say that I want to
Do#              Re#m
Leave it all behind?


              Si
I can't take my mind off of you
              La#m
I can't take my mind off you
              Sol#m
I can't take my mind off of you
              Fa#
I can't take my mind off you
            Si         Do#
I can't take my mind off you
        Si
I can't take my mind...
        Si
My mind...my mind...
