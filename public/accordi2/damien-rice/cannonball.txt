There's still a little bit of your taste, in my mouth
Mim7                  Doadd9        Sol          Sol/Fa#
There's still a little bit of you laced, with my doubt
Mim7               Doadd9     Sol   Sol/Fa#        Mim7
It's still a little hard to say,     what's going on


Mim7                 Doadd9       Sol          Sol/Fa#
There's still a little bit of your ghost, your witness
Mim7                 Doadd9       Sol             Sol/Fa#
There's still a little bit of your face, I haven't kissed
Mim7                Doadd9      Sol       
You step a little closer each day,       
Sol/Fa#                   Mim7

Stones taught me to fly
Sol     Doadd9        Re
Love taught me to lie
Sol    Doadd9         Re
Life taught me to die
             Mim7                   Doadd9           Mim7
So it's not hard to fall, when you float like a cannonball

There's still a little bit of your song, in my ear
Mim7                   Doadd9         Sol       Sol/Fa#
There's still a little bit of your words, I long to hear
Mim7               Doadd9     Sol          Sol/Fa#
You step a little closer to me, so close that 
I can't see what's going on
