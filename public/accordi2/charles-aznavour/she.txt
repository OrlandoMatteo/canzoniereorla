Do#
She
                            Midim
May be the face I can' t forget
                        Fa#
A trace of pleasure I regret
                          Do#             La#7
May be my treasure or the price I have to pay
Re#m                              Ladim
  She may be the song that summer sings
                             Do#/Sol#
May be the chill that autumn brings
                         Fa#
May be a hundred tearful things
           Sol#4          Do#   Fa# Sol#4 Sol#
Within the measure of the day

Do#
She
                         Midim
May be the beauty or the beast
                         Fa#
May be the famine or the feast
                           Do#        La#7
May turn each day into heaven... or a hell
Re#m                          Ladim
  She may be the mirror of my dreams
                       Do#/Sol#
A smile reflected in a stream
                            Fa#
She may not be what she may seem
  Sol#4  Do#
Inside a shell

La
She
                               Mi
who always seems so happy in a crowd
                                    Re
Whose eyes can be so private and so proud
                             Do#
No one's allowed to see them when they cry
Fa#m           Si                       Mi
She may be the love that cannot hope to last
            Do#                    Re#
May come to me from shadows of the past
         Re#7                  Sol#  Sol#7
That I remember till the day I die

Do#
She
                       Midim
may be the reason I survive
                           Fa#
The why and wherefore I'm alive
                                  Do#             La#7
The one I'll care for through the rough and rainy years
Re#m                                Ladim
  Me I'll take her laughter and her tears
                          Do#/Sol#
And make them all my souvenirs
                            Fa#
For where she goes I got to be
            Sol#4
The meaning of my life is ...

Fa#    Do#/Fa  Re#m7   Do#
  She, she....... mmh, she
