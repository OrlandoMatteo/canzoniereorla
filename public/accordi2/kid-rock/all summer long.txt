       Re  Do                   Sol
It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long
Re                  Do               Sol
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
Re        Do             Sol
She was 17 and she was far from in between
       Re             Do        Sol
It was summertime in Northern Michigan

   Re               Do         Sol    
Splashin' thru the sandbar, talkin' by the campfire
          Re                Do                  Sol 
It's the simple things in life like when and where
    Re             Do             Sol
We didn't have no internet, but man I never will forget
    Re                 Do               Sol
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair


            Re                Do                  Sol
And we were tryin' different things and we were smokin' funny things
       Re               Do                    Sol
Makin' love out by the lake to our favorite songs
        Re              Do          Sol
Sippin' whisky out the bottle not thinkin' 'bout tomorrow
        Re             Do        Sol            Re  Do  Sol
Singin' sweet home alabama all summer long

         Re                Do             Sol
Catchin' walleye from the dock watchin' waves roll off the rocks
          Re             Do             Sol
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
      Re             Do               Sol
We'd blister in the sun we couldn't wait for night to come
   Re              Do                Sol
To hit that sandy place of rock 'n roll


            Re                Do                  Sol
And we were tryin' different things and we were smokin' funny things

Now nothin' seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
   Re                    Do                Sol
Oh how we thought those days would never end
    Re                 Do             Sol
Sometimes I hear that song and I'll start to sing along
          Re               Do               Sol
And think man I'd like to see that girl again
