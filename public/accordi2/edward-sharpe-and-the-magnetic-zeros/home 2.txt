Do you remember that day you fell outta my window?
I sure do, you came jumping out after me.
Well, you fell on the concrete, nearly broke your ass, you were bleeding all over
place and I rushed you out to the hospital, you remember that?
Yes I do.
Well there's something I never told you about that night.
 What didn't you tell me?
While you were sitting in the backseat smoking a cigarette you thought was gonna be 
last, I was falling deep, deeply in love with you, and I never told you til just now.
