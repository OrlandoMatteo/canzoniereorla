Mim
Here's a song
                          Re6/Mi
It reminds me of when we were young
                        Lam9
Looking back at all the things we'd done
         Domaj7
Gotta keep on keeping on
Mim
Out to sea
                      Re6/Mi
It's the only place I honestly
                    Lam9
Can get myself some peace of mind
                      Domaj7
You know it's getting hard to fly
Sol
If I'm to fall
Re/Fa#
Would you be there to applaud?
   Mim
Or would you hide behind them all?
                 Lam
Cos if I have to go
                Do
In my heart you grow
                       Sol
And that's where you belong

Mim  Re6/Mi  Lam  Do

Sol
If I'm to fall
Re/Fa#
Would you be there to applaud?
   Mim
Or would you hide behind them all?
                 Lam
Cos if I have to go
                 Do
In my heart you grow
                       Sol
And that's where you belong

Sol
If I'm to fall
Re/Fa#
Would you be there to applaud?
   Mim
Or would you hide behind them all?
                 Lam
Cos if I have to go
                Do
In my heart you grow
                       Sol
And that's where you belong

      Sol
Guess I'm outta time
               Sol/Fa#
I'm outta time
Mim
I'm outta time
Lam
I'm outta time
Do
I'm outta time

Sol     Sol/Fa# Mim   Lam   Do
