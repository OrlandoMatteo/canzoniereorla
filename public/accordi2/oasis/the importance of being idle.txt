  Lam                    Famaj7
I sold my soul for the second time
        Do             Si7 Mi7
cos the land, it don't pay me
  Lam                    Famaj7
i begged my landlord for some more time
         Do                 Si7 Mi7
he said "son, the bills are waiting"
   Lam                       Famaj7
my best friend called me the other night
         Do           Si7 Mi7
he said "man, are you crazy?"
   Lam                    Famaj7
my girlfriend told me to get a life
         Do           Si7 Mi7
she said boy, are you lazy

Rem           Lam
  But i don't mind
   Rem                               Lam
as long as there's a bed beneath the stars that shine
Rem       Lam
  I'll be fine
       Fa7
If you give me a minute, a man's got a limit
  Sol                    Mi7
I can't get a life if my heart's not in it

Lam  Fa  Do  Si7 Mi  Lam  Fa  Do  Si7 Mi

Lam  Fa  Do  Si7 Mi  Lam  Fa  Do  Si7 Mi

Rem           Lam

       Fa7
If you give me a minute, a man's got a limit
  Sol                    Mi7
I can't get a life if my heart's not in it

I lost my faith in the summertime
       Do         Si7 Mi7
cos it don't stop raining
    Lam                   Famaj7
The sky all day is as black as night
        Do      Si7 Mi7
but i'm not complaining
  Lam                  Famaj7
I begged my doctor for one more line
        Do        Si7  Mi7
he said son words fail me
   Lam                   Famaj7
it ain't no place to be killing time
        Do       Si7 Mi7
i guess i'm just lazy
