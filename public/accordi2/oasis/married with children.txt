[<pre>Mi          Sol#              Do#m        La
There's no need for you to say you're sorry
    Do        Si7    Mi
Goodbye, I'm going home
Mi       Sol#              Do#m       La
I don't care no more so don't you worry
    Do        Si7    Mi
Goodbye, I'm going home

La               	 Mi
I hate the way that even though you 
            La	         	  Mi
know you're wrong, you say you're right
La                              Mi
 I hate the books you read and all your friends
     Fa#                         La             Sol
Your music's shite, it keeps me up all night...

Do#m	       Sol#m	  La                   Mi
And it will be nice to be alone for a week or two
Do#m	        Sol#m              La
But I know that I will be right, right back here 
     Si         La         Sol#m       Fa#
with you, with you, with you, with you,
     Si         La         Sol#m       Fa#
with you, with you, with you...</pre>]
