        Si   Do#m7 Sol#m7      Si   Do#m7 Sol#m7

       Si           Do#m7        Sol#m7    Si    Do#m7  Sol#m7
Four seasons seconds flicker and flash I´m alone
   Si            Do#m7        Sol#m7         Fa#7sus4
A lonely screen provides the scene it´s not home
       Miadd9           Do#m7
Every night I hear you scream
  Miadd9             La    Mi/Sol#
But you don´t say what you mean
     Si               Do#m7   Sol#m7    Si    Do#m7  Sol#m7
This was my dream but now my dream has flown
    Si                  Do#m7   Sol#m7 Si    Do#m7  Sol#m7
I´m at the cross roads waiting for a sign
    Si               Do#m7     Sol#m7   Fa#7sus4
My life is standing still but I´m still alive
      Miadd9           Do#m7
Every night I think I know
        Miadd9              La  Mi/Sol#
In the morning where did it go
    Si           Do#m7      Sol#m7    Si    Do#m7  Sol#m7
The answers disappear when I open my eyes

Si
I´m no stranger to this place where real life and dreams collide
La
  And even though I fall from grace
Si
I will keep the dream alive
La              Mi/Sol# Si   Do#m7 Sol#m7   Si  Do#m7 Sol#m7
I will keep the dream  alive

Si   Do#m7 Sol#m7   Si  Do#m7 Sol#m7

      Si              Do#m7       Sol#m7     Si    Do#m7  Sol#m7
Four seasons seconds flicker and flash I´m alone
   Si               Do#m7     Sol#m7        Fa#7sus4
A lonely screen provides the scene it´s not home
       Miadd9           Do#m7
Every night I hear you scream
         Miadd9             La  Mi/Sol#
But you don´t say what you mean
     Si                Do#m7  Sol#m7    Si    Do#m7  Sol#m7
This was my dream but now my dream has flown

  Si
  I´m no stranger to this place where real life and dreams collide
  La
    And even though I fall from grace
  Si
  I will keep the dream alive
  Si
  I´m no stranger to this place where real life and dreams collide
  La
    And even though I fall from grace
  Si
  I will keep the dream alive

        Si     La  Si      La  Si

        Si     La  Si      La  Si
