     Do/Sol  Do5  Do/Sol  Do5

             Do/Sol
Who kicked a hole in the sky
       Do5                       Lam  Fa
So the heavens would cry over me?
              Do/Sol
Who stole the soul from the sun
     Do5                            Lam  Fa
In a world come undone at the seams?

             Do/Sol  La#9
Let there be love
             Lam   Fa
Let there be love
             Do/Sol  La#9
Let there be love
             Lam   Fa
Let there be love

Lam          Mi7/Sol#
Come on Baby Blue
              Sol
Shake up your tired eyes
             Re/Fa#
The world is waiting for you
    Fa                Re7            Sol   Mi7
May all your dreaming fill the empty sky
          Lam
But if it makes you happy
Do/Sol
Keep on clapping
Mi7                           Lam   Lam7
Just remember I'll be by your side
           Famaj7             Re7            Sol   Mi7
And if you don't let go its gonna pass you by


     Fa  Re7  Sol  Mi7
