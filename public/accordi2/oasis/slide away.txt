[<pre>Lam7              Sol                  Fa
Slide away,  and give it all you've got
Lam7         Sol                Fa
My today, fell in from the top
Lam7                   Sol                  Fa
I dream of you, and all the things you say
Lam7                        Sol  Fa
I wonder where you are now

Lam7              Sol                  Fa
Hold me down,  all the world's asleep
Lam7         Sol                Fa
I need you now, you've got me on my knees
Lam7                   Sol                  Fa
I dream of you, we talk of growing old
Lam7                        Sol  Fa
But you said please don't

Solsus2          Fasus2      Solsus2              Fasus2
Slide in, baby - together we'll fly
Solsus2             Fasus2          Sol          
I've tried praying - and I know just what 
                Sol7
you're saying to me

		Do
Now that you're mine, 
             Sol
we'll find a way
	       Famaj7
of chasing the sun
              Lam7
Let me be the one
                Sol
Who shines with you
        Re7                                 Fasus2
In the morning when you don't know what to do
         Do
Two of a kind
             Sol
We'll find a way
                 Famaj7
To do what we've done
              Lam7                  Sol
Let me be the one that shines with you
                    Fasus2    Fa#/Re          Fasus2  
And we can slide away		slide away
Fa#/Re
 Sol           Mi
Away...</pre>]
