 Talking to the songbird yesterday
                       Sol/Fa# Mim
Flew me to a place not far    away

She's a little pilot in my mind
                         Re/Fa#   Sol
Singing songs of love to pass the time

Gonna write a song so she can see
                          Sol/Fa#  Mim
Give her all the love she gives to me

Talk of better days that have yet to come
                               Re/Fa#  Sol
I've never felt this love from any...  one

She's not anyone
      Sol/Fa# Mim
She's not  anyone
                      Re/Fa# Sol
She's not anyone


A man can never dream these kind of things
                             Sol/Fa#    Mim
Especially when she came and spread her wings

Whispered in my ear the things i'd like
                     Re/Fa#  Sol
Then she flew away into the night

Gonna write a song so she can see
                          Sol/Fa#  Mim
Give her all the love she gives to me

Talk of better days that have yet to come
                               Re/Fa#  Sol
I've never felt this love from any...  one

She's not anyone
      Sol/Fa# Mim
She's not  anyone
                      Re/Fa# Sol
She's not anyone
