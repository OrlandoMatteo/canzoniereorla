Mi
a little space, a little time
Resus2              Mi
see what it can do
Mi
a little faith, a piece of mind
Resus2                      Mi
see what puts things through

Resus2                      Lasus2  
the sun will shine on you again
Mi                   Resus2 
a bell will ring inside your head
La                            Mi    
and all will be brand new

Mi
come along, come on in
Resus2                           Mi
here's something that you'll know
Mi
who wonders why as your restless there ?
Resus2                 Mi
so entertain your goal

Resus2                      Lasus2
the sun will shine on you again
Mi        Resus2
a bell will ring inside your head
La                            Mi
and all will be brand new

Re4                   Mi
sleepless on your floor

Resus2                       Lasus2
the sun will shine on you again
Mi                    Resus2
a bell will ring inside your head

La                          Mi
and all will be brand new
La                      Mi       
all will be brand new
