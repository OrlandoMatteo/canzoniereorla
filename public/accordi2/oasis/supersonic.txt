[<pre>          Fa#m        La    Si
I need to be myself
          Fa#m        La    Si
I can't be no one else
    Fa#m                 La               Si
I'm feeling supersonic, give me gin and tonic
Fa#m                     La               Si
You can have it all but how much do you want it?

    Fa#m             La    Si
You make me laugh
    Fa#m            La    Si
Give me your autograph
      Fa#m                  La    Si
Can I ride with you in your BMW?
        Fa#m                 La            Si
You can sail with me in my yellow submarine

    Mi
You need to find out
                                      Fa#m
'Cos no one's gonna tell you what I'm on about
    Mi                                           Do#7
You need to find a way for what you want to say

But before tomorrow

     Re         La         Mi        Fa#m
Cause my friend said he'd take you home
   Re         La      Mi   Fa#m
He sits in a corner all alone
Re        La       Mi     Fa#m
He lives under a waterfall
Re           La
No body can see him
Mi         Fa#m                   Re   La
No body can ever hear him call
Mi         Fa#m                   Re   La
No body can ever hear him call</pre>]
