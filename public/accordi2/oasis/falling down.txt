       Fa#m   Fa#m7   Remaj7  Si7sus4

Fa#m             Fa#m7
Summer sun, that blows my mind
   Remaj7                     Si7sus4
Is falling down on all that I’ve ever known
Fa#m               Fa#m7
Time will kiss the world goodbye
Remaj7                     Si7sus4        Remaj7
Falling down on all that I’ve ever known
    Mi                 Fa#m   Fa#m7   Remaj7  Si7sus4
Is all that I’ve ever known

Fa#m   Fa#m7   Remaj7  Si7sus4

  Fa#m         Fa#m7
A dying scream makes no sound
Remaj7           Si7sus4
Calling out to all that I’ve ever known
Fa#m       Fa#m7
Here am I, lost and found
Remaj7          Si7sus4
Calling out o all

Fa#m   Fa#m7              Remaj7  Si7sus4
        We live a dying dream
 Fa#m  Fa#m7                Remaj7
        If you know what I mean
     Si7sus4               Remaj7
 And I that I’ve ever known
      Mi                  Fa#m
It’s all that I’ve ever known

La                     Mi              Fa#m
Catch the wheel that breaks the butterfly
  Remaj7                             Fa#m
A crying rain that fills the ocean wide
  La                 Mi         Fa#m
I tried to talk with God to no avail
           Remaj7          Mi
Calling up in and out of nowhere
         Remaj7               Sim7         La       Fa#m
Said “if you won’t save me, please don’t waste my time”

A crying rain that fills the ocean wide

I tried to talk with God to no avail

Calling up in and out of nowhere
         Remaj7               Sim7         La       Fa#m
Said “if you won’t save me, please don’t waste my time”
