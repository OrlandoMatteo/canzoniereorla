We the people fight for our existence
   Mimadd9                             La
We don't claim to be perfect but we're free
   Mimadd9                          La
We dream our dreams alone with no resistance
Mimadd9                          La
Fading like the stars we wish to be

on the wrong side of his bed...

and it just don't matter now

True perfection has to be imperfect
  Mimadd9                                La
I know that that sounds foolish but it's true
    Mimadd9                             La
The day has come and now you'll have to accept
    Mimadd9                          La
The life inside your head we give to you
