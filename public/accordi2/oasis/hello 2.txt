Mi                Lam           Famaj7                         Sol
We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away 
          Do          Do/Si     Lam
And it's never gonna be the same 
        Famaj7              Sol
Cos the years are falling by like the rain 
      Do          Do/Si     Lam

till the life I knew comes to my house and says 

    Lam  Famaj7 
Hello!


There ain't no sense in feeling lonely 
They got no faith in you 
But I've got a feeling you still owe me 
So wipe the shit from your shoes 
Nobody ever mentions the weather can make or break your day 
Nobody ever seems to remember life is a game we play 


We live in the shadows and we had the chance and threw it away 
And it's never gonna be the same 
Cos the years are falling by like the rain 
it's never gonna be the same 
till the life I knew comes to my house and says ....
