Mi
 You ever love someone so much you thought

your little heart was gonna break in two?
         Sol   La  Mi
I didn't think so

You ever tried with all your heart and soul

to get you lover back to you?
        Sol  La  Mi
I wanna hope so

You ever pray with all your heart and soul
                             Sol La Mi
just to watch her walk away?

Mi                         Sol La

Mi                         Sol La
 Baby did a bad bad thing,
Mi
 Baby did a bad bad thing,
  Sol  La  Mi7
feel like crying, feel like crying

Mi
 You ever toss and turn your lying awake

and thinking about the one you love?
        Sol   La   Mi
I don't think so

You ever close your eyes your making believe

your holding the one your dreaming of?
            Sol La  Mi
Well if you say so

I hurts so bad when you finally know
                                         Sol La
just how low, low, low, low, low, she'll go

Mi                         Sol La
 Baby did a bad bad thing,
Mi                         Sol La
 Baby did a bad bad thing,
Mi
 Baby did a bad bad thing,
  Sol  La  Mi7
feel like crying, feel like crying

La              Mi
Ohh   Feel like crying, feel like crying
La              Mi
Ohh,  feel like crying, feel like crying
