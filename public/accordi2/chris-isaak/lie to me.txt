       Solm  Fa6  Do9   Solm Fa6

Solm        Fa6   Do9           Solm Fa6
 There is a woman, far over the sea
Solm          Fa6    Do9           Solm Fa6
 Standing and waiting, praying for me
Solm      Fa6       Do9            Solm Fa6
 Here I lie sleeping, a girl by my side
Solm      Fa6    Do9           Solm Fa6
 Who am I hurting, each time I lie?

Solm     Fa6 Do9   Solm Fa
Lie to me,   lie.....
Solm     Fa6 Do9   Solm Fa
Lie to me,   lie.....

Solm         Fa6  Do9                Solm Fa6
 There is a woman, trying hard to be brave
Solm             Fa6    Do9             Solm Fa6
 The way that I hurt her, has made her afraid
Solm          Fa6     Do9                Solm Fa6
 Things that I'm doing, are breaking her heart
Solm            Fa6    Do9                Solm Fa6
 Still she's pretending, that we'll never part

Solm     Fa6 Do9   Solm Fa6
Lie to me,   lie.....
Solm     Fa6 Do9   Solm Fa6
Lie to me,   lie.....

Solm              Fa6
I don't care what people may say,
  Do9            Solm Fa6
I know everybody lies
Solm              Fa6
I'm not trying to hurt my love,
    Do9                Solm Fa6
I'm only trying to get by

       Solm  Fa6  Do9  Solm Fa

       Solm  Fa6  Do9  Solm Fa

Solm        Fa6  Do9            Solm Fa6
 There is a woman, far over the sea
Solm           Fa6   Do9           Solm Fa6
 Standing and waiting, praying for me
Solm          Fa6  Do9           Solm Fa6
 Here I lie guilty, a girl by my side
Solm       Fa6   Do9           Solm Fa6
 Who am I hurting, each time I lie?

Solm     Fa6 Do9   Solm Fa6
Lie to me,   lie.....
Solm     Fa6 Do9   Solm Fa6
Lie to me,   lie.....
Solm     Fa6 Do9   Solm Fa6
Lie to me,   lie.....
Solm     Fa6 Do9   Solm Fa6
Lie to me,   lie.....
