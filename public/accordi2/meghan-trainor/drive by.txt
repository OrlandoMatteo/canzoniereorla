Do#m                                    La
  On the other side of a street I knew Stood a girl that looked like you
Mi                          Si
I guess that's déjà vu But I thought this can't be true
      Do#m                      La
Cause you moved to west L.A or New York or Santa Fe
   Mi                           Si
Or where ever to get away from me


Fa#m                   La
 Oh but that one night Was more than just right
Do#m                Si
 I didn't leave you cause I was all through
Fa#m                  La
 Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Sol#                 Sol#7
 Because I really fell for you


La                Mi                    Si                   Do#m  Si     
 Oh I swear to ya I'll be there for ya This is not a drive by
La              Mi                   Si                    Dodim       
 Just a shy guy looking for a 2-ply Hefty bag to hold my love
La                 Mi                   Si                       Do#m                        
 When you move me everything is groovy They don't like it sue me
             Si     La               Mi                                                    
 The way you do me Oh I swear to ya I'll be there for ya
Fa#m                 Sol#7                                                           
 This is not a drive by


Do#m                                    La
 On the other side of a downward spiral My love for you went viral
Mi                          Si              Do#m
 And I loved you every mile you drove away But now here you are again
   La                 
 So let's skip the "how you been" 
    Mi                                   Si
 And get down to the "more than friends" at last


Fa#m                   La
 Oh but that one night Was still the highlight
Do#m                Si
 I didn't neeed you until I came to
Fa#m                 La
 And I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Sol#                 Sol#7
 Because I really fell for you


La                Mi                    Si                   Do#m  Si
