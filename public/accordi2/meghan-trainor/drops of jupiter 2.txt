        Do  Sol  Fa

    Do
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
     Sol                                   Fa
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey, hey
    Do
She acts like summer and walks like rain
  Sol                                        Fa
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey
Do
Since the return from her stay on the moon
    Sol                                           Fa
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey

Sol                         Lam7 Re
Tell me did you sail across the  sun
                             Fa                            Do
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded

And that heaven is overrated
Sol                             Lam7 Re
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
                        Rem
One without a permanent scar

And did you miss me while you were
Fa                      Do    Sol   Faadd9
looking at yourself out there

    Do
Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Sol                                        Fa
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, hey
    Do
She checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo
  Sol                                   Fa
Reminds me that there's time to grow, hey, hey
    Do
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
     Sol                                 Fa
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane

Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land

Sol                                 Lam7 Re
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your  feet
                                  Fa                         Do
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day

And head back to the Milky Way
Sol                          Lam7 Re
And tell me, did Venus blow your  mind
                                 Rem
Was it everything you wanted to find

And did you miss me while you were
Fa                        Do    Sol   Faadd9
looking for yourself out there

                   Do
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
     Sol                         Faadd9
Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong
                   Do                                Sol
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation
    La#                               Fa
The best soy latte that you ever had . . . and me

Sol                               Lam7  Re
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
                               Fa                          Do
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day

And head back toward the Milky Way
Sol                         Lam7 Re
Tell me did you sail across the  sun
                             Fa                            Do
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded

And that heaven is overrated
Sol                           Lam7   Re
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
                         Rem
One without a permanent scar

And did you miss me while you were
Fa
looking at yourself out there

Do   Sol   Faadd9   Do   Sol   Faadd9

Do   Sol   Faadd9   Do   Sol   La#  Fa
