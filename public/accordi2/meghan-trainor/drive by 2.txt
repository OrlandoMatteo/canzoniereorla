       Do#m

Do#m
On the other side of a street I knew
La
 Stood a girl that looked like you,
Mi
 I guess that's déjà vu
   Si
But  I thought this can't be true 'cause
Do#m
 You moved to west La
 La
Or New York or Santa Fe
  Mi                      Si
Or wherever, to get away from me
Fa#m7                 La
Oh, but that one night, was more than just right
Do#m               Si
 I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Fa#m7                 La
 Oh, I was overwhelmed, and frankly scared as Hell
Sol#7sus4            Sol#7
 Because I really fell for you

La                Mi                     Si
Oh, I swear to you, I'll be there for you
                    Do#m  Si  La
This is not a drive by-y--y-y-y
           Mi
Just a shy guy, looking for a two-ply
Si                   Sol#7      La
Hefty bag to hold my-y-y-y-y-y love
                  Mi
When you move me, everything is groovy
Si                           Do#m          Si
They don't like it sue me, mmh the way you do me
La                Mi                     Fa#m
Oh, I swear to you, I'll be there for you
                    Sol#7    Do#m
This is not a drive by-y-y-y-y

Do#m                             La
On the upside of a downward spiral
                         Mi
My love for you went viral
                         Si
And I loved you every mile you drove away
Do#m
 But now here you are again
  La
So let's skip the 'how you been'
   Mi                            Si
And get down to the 'more than friends' at last
Fa#m7                 La
Oh, but that one night, is still the highlight
Do#m              Si
 I didn't need you until I came to
Fa#m7                 La
 And I was overwhelmed, and frankly scared as Hell
Sol#7sus4            Sol#7
 Because I really fell for you

La                Mi                     Si
Oh, I swear to you, I'll be there for you
                    Do#m  Si  La
This is not a drive by-y--y-y-y
           Mi
Just a shy guy, looking for a two-ply
Si                   Sol#7      La
Hefty bag to hold my-y-y-y-y-y love
                  Mi
When you move me, everything is groovy
Si                           Do#m          Si
They don't like it sue me, mmh the way you do me
La                Mi                   Fa#m
Oh, I swear to you, I'll be there for you
                    Sol#7
This is not a drive by-y-y-y-y

Sol#m7   Do#m       Fa#m   Si  Si/La
Please believe that when I leave
        Sol#7         Fa#m                  Si
There's nothing up my sleeve, but love for you

And a little time to get my head together too

Do#m                                La
On the other side of a street I knew
