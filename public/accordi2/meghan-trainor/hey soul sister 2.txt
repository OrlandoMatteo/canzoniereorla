[<pre>Mi  Si            Do#m  La
 ...Hey, hey, hey...

     Mi             Si
Your lipstick stains
                        Do#m           La
On the front lobe of my left-side brains
                     Mi
I knew I wouldn't forget you
                  Si
And so I went and let you
         Do#m   La Si
Blow my mind
     Mi             Si
Your sweet moonbeam
                          Do#m
The smell of you in every single dream
  La
I dream
                  Mi
I knew when we collided
                        Si
You're the one I have decided
                 Do#m   La Si
Who's one of my kind

La
Hey, soul sister
 Si            Mi
Ain't that Mr. Mister
Si     La
On the radio, stereo?
    Si                 Mi        Si
The way you move ain't fair, you know
La
Hey, soul sister
Si            Mi
I don't wanna miss
  Si     La          Si    Mi
A single thing you do ...tonight
     Si         Do#m  La
Hey, hey, hey...

Mi          Si
Just in time
                       Do#m
I'm so glad you have a one-track mind
      La
Like me
                   Mi
You gave my life direction
                    Si
A game-show love connection
           Do#m   La Si
We can't deny
    Mi           Si
I'm so obsessed
                                Do#m                La
My heart is bound to beat right out of my untrimmed chest
             Mi                           Si
I believe in you, like a virgin, you're Madonna
                     Do#m
And I'm always gonna wanna
           La   Si
Blow your mind

La

The way you move ain't fair, you know

Hey, soul sister
Si            Mi
I don't wanna miss
  Si     La         Si    Mi
A single thing you do...tonight

Way you can cut a rug
Si
Watching you's the only drug
  Do#m
I need

So gangster, I'm so thug
           La/Do#
You're the only one I'm dreaming of
    Mi/Si
You see
                          Si
I can be myself now finally
                                Do#m
In fact there's nothing I can't be
           Si           La
I want the world to see you'll be
Si
With me
