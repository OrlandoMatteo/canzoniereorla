       Faadd9

Do                    Sol/Si
 Forever can never be long enough for me
   Lam7               Do/Sol           Faadd9
To feel like I've had long enough with you
Do                      Sol/Si
  Forget the world now, we won't let them see
Lam7       Do/Sol        Faadd9  Do/Mi
 But there's one thing left to do
                      Faadd9    Do/Mi
Now that the weight has lifted
             Faadd9
Love has surely shifted my way

Do   Sol/Si  Lam7
Marry me
  Do/Sol      Faadd9
Today and every day
Do    Sol/Si
  Marry me
     Lam7         Do/Sol           Faadd9
If I ever get the nerve to say "Hello" in this cafe
         Do/Mi
Say you will
   Faadd9
Mm-hmm
         Do/Mi
Say you will

Do                     Sol/Si
 Together can never be close enough for me
   Lam7           Do/Sol          Faadd9   Do
To feel like I am close enough to you
                   Sol/Si                     Lam7   Do/Sol
You wear white and I'll wear out the words "I love you"
           Faadd9    Do/Mi
And you're beautiful
                    Faadd9   Do/Mi
Now that the wait is over
                    Faadd9
And love has finally shown her my way
