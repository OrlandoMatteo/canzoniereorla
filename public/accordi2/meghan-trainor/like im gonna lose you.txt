[<pre>Do
I found myself dreaming
Mim
In silver and gold
Lam
Like a scene from a movie
     Fa      Mim     Rem    Sol
That every broken heart knows

Do
We were walking on moonlight
Mim
And you pulled me close
Lam
Split second and you disappeared
         Fa     Mim  Rem    Sol
And then I was all alone


Do
I woke up in tears with you by my side
Mim
Breath of relief
            Lam
And I realized
              Fa    Mim     Rem    Sol
No, we're not promised tomorrow


            Do                        Mim
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
          Lam                         Fa   Sol
I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
                Do
Wherever we're standing
                    Mim
I won't take you for granted
                   Lam                              Fa   Sol
'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time

             Do                       Mim
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
             Lam                      Fa     Sol
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lo-se you


Do
In the blink of an eye
Mim
Just a whisper of smoke
Lam
You could lose everything
Fa     Mim     Rem    Sol
The truth is you never know

Do
So I'll kiss you longer baby
Mim
Any chance that I get
Lam
And I'll make the most of the minutes
Fa     Mim     Rem    Sol
And love with no regrets


Do
Let's take our time to say what we want
Mim                                  Lam
Use what we got before it's all gone
                     Fa    Mim   Rem    Sol
'Cause no, we're not promised tomorrow


            Do                        Mim
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
          Lam                         Fa   Sol
I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
                Do
Wherever we're standing
                    Mim
I won't take you for granted
                   Lam                              Fa   Sol
'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time

             Do                       Mim
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
             Lam                      Fa      Sol
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lo-se you
