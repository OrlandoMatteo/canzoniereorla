Rem7           Sol7            Do
   Sunday morning rain is falling
Rem7             Sol7           Do
   Steal some covers share some skin
Rem7           Sol7               Do
   Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
       Rem7               Sol7           Do
   You twist to fit the mold that I am in
        Rem7                 Sol7           Do
   But things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
               Rem7            Sol7              Do
   And I would gladly hit the road get up and go if I knew
        Rem7               Sol7             Do
   That someday it would lead me back to you
        Rem7               Sol7             Do
   That someday it would lead me back to you


            Rem7 Sol7  Do
That may be all I   need
                   Rem7 Sol7  Do
In darkness she is all I   see
                   Rem7    Sol7   Do
Come and rest your bones with  me
                       Rem7
Driving slow on Sunday morning
       Sol7            Do
And I never want to leave


Rem7         Sol7               Do
   Fingers trace your every outline
Rem7         Sol7           Do
   Paint a picture with my hands
Rem7          Sol7                Do
   Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
              Rem7               Sol7           Do
   Change the weather still together when it ends



            Rem7 Sol7  Do
That may be all I   need
                   Rem7 Sol7  Do
In darkness she is all I   see
                   Rem7    Sol7   Do
Come and rest your bones with  me
                       Rem7
Driving slow on Sunday morning
      Sol7            Do
And I never want to leave
