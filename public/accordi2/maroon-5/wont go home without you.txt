[<pre>Do                                     Rem
I asked her to stay--But she wouldn't listen
Sol                                   Do   Do/Si
She left before I had the chance to say Oh
Lam                                             Rem
The words that were mend--the things that were broken
      Fa               Sol                Do
But now it's far too late, she's gone away


Do
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
Lam
Thinking why does this happen to me
Re7/Fa#                                Fa
Why does every moment have to be so hard
Sol
Hard to believe it


Do
It's not over tonight
                      Rem
Just give me one more chance to make it right
                  Fa
I may not make it through the night
  Sol                 Do
I won't go home without you


Lam                                      Rem
The taste of her breath, I'll never get over
        Sol                             Do     Do/Si
And the noises that she made kept me awake, oh
    Lam                               Rem
The weight of things that remained unspoken
   Fa                 Sol                Do
Built up so much it crushed us every day


Do
Every night you cry yourself to sleep

La#         Fa                  Do            Sol
Of all the things I felt I've never really showed
Re#          La#               Fa           
Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go, 
Sol                     Sol
should not ever let you go oh oh oh

I won't go home without you</pre>]
