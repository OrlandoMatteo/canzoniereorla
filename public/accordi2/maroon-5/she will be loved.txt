Lam              Sol
Beauty queen of only eighteen
Lam                   Sol
She had some trouble with herself

She always belonged to someone else

I drove for miles and miles
Lam                   Sol
And wound up at your door

I’ve had you so many times but somehow

Look for the girl with the broken smile

Lam                      Sol
I want to make you feel beautiful
Lam               Sol
I know I tend to get so insecure
Lam                Sol
It doesn’t matter anymore

Lam              Sol
It’s not always rainbows and butterflies
Lam                            Sol
It’s compromise that moves us along
