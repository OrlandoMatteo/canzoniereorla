Mi7/Sol#                   Lam
I was so high I did not recognize
          Rem                             
the fire burning in her eyes, the chaos
        Sidim7
that controlled my mind...
Mi7/Sol#                         Lam
Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane
          Rem                           Sidim7
Never to return again but always in my heart


Lam   Rem      Sol7         Do
This love has taken its toll on me
Lam       Rem         Sol7            Do
She said goodbye too many times before
Lam  Rem        Sol7           Do
Her heart is breaking in front of me
    Lam         Re            Fa              Mi  
and I have no choice, cause I won't say goodbye 
    Mi7/Sol# - Lam - Rem - Sidim7
anymore


Mi7/Sol#                        Lam
I tried my best to feed her appetite
                Rem
Keep her coming every night
                    Sidim7
So hard to keep her satisfied
Mi7/Sol#                         Lam
Kept playing love like it was just a game
              Rem
Pretending to feel the same
                     Sidim7
Then turn around and leave again


Lam   Rem      Sol7         Do
This love has taken its toll on me
Lam       Rem         Sol7            Do
She said goodbye too many times before
Lam  Rem        Sol7           Do
Her heart is breaking in front of me

and I have no choice, cause I won't say goodbye

 Rem
I'll fix these broken things
  Do
Repair your broken wings
Mi7/Sol#                         Lam
And make sure everything's alright
Rem
My pressure on your hips
Do
Sinking my fingertips
Mi7
Into every inch of you
Cause I know that's what you want me to do
