I'm at a payphone trying to call home
          Mim7               Re4  
All of my change I spent on you
               Doadd9                           
Where have the times gone baby
     Sol                        Mim7               Re4
It's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two


      Doadd9                           
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
Sol                          Mim7
  The people we used to be    It's even harder to picture
Re4                             Doadd9
  That you're not here next to me    You say it's too late to make it
Sol                            Mim7
  But is it too late to try?    And in our time that you wasted
Re4                    Doadd9                
All of our bridges burned down


               Sol                         Mim7
I've wasted my nights You turned out the lights
            Re4                     Doadd9                  Sol
Now I'm paralyzed Still stuck in that time when we called it love
             Mim7             Re4
But even the sun sets in paradise

              Doadd9           Sol
If happy ever after did exist
                 Mim7                   Re4
I would still be holding you like this
                   Doadd9                  Sol
And all those fairytales are full of shit
                Mim7                    Re4
One more fucken love song I'll be sick


Doadd9                              Sol
  You turned your back on tomorrow   Cause you forgot yesterday
Mim7                            Re4
  I gave you my love to borrow      But you just gave it away
Doadd9                            Sol
  You can't expect me to be fine   I don't expect you to care
Mim7                         Re4                           Doadd9
  I know I've said it before   But all of our bridges burned down

                           Mim7
while you're sitting round Wondering why it wasn't you who came 
                Re4
up from nothing Made it from the botton Now when you see me I'm stunning
Doadd9 
  And all of my cars start with a push of a button
Sol
Telling me the chances I blew up or whatever you call it
Mim7
Switched the number to my phone So you never could call it
Re4
Don't need my name on my show You can tell it I'm ballin'
Doadd9
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Sol                                               Mim7
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot

So you talk about who you see at the top
   Re4
Or what you could have saw But sad to say it's over for
Doadd9
  Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Sol                                               Mim7
  Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for Now it's me who they want
