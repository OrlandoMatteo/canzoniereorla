I asked her to stay  But she wouldn't listen
    La#                             Re#   La#/Re
She left before I had the chance to say Oh
    Dom7                                         Fam7
The words that were mend  the things that were broken
    Sol#              La#             Re#
But now its far too late she's gone away
      Re#
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
         Dom7
Thinking why does this happen to me
         Lam7b5                     Sol#add9
Why does every moment have to be so hard
La#
  Hard to believe it

Re#
It's not over tonight
                      Fam7
Just give me one more chance to make it right
                  Sol#
I may not make it through the night
  La#              Re#
I won't go home without you

    Dom7                                Fam
The taste of her breath, I'll never get over
    La#                           Re#     La#/Re
The noises that she made kept me awake  Oh
    Dom7                                  Fam7
The weight of the things that remained unspoken
      Sol#           La#             Re#
Built up so much it crushed us everyday
      Re#
Every night you cry yourself to sleep

Do#         Sol#                Re#          La#
 Of all the things I felt I've never really showed
Fa#         Do#             Sol#          La#
 Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go,

should not ever let you go oh oh oh
