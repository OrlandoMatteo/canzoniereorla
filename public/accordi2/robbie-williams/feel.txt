                Rem
Come on hold my hand,
Lam/Do                La/Do#
  I wanna contact the living.
La7               Solm
  Not sure I understand,
Rem/Fa                La
  This role I've been given.

                  Rem
I sit and talk to god
Lam/Do                     La/Do#
  And he just laughs at my plans,
La7                Solm
  My head speaks a language,
Rem/Fa          La
  I don’t understand.

             La#          Fa
I just wanna feel... real love,
                     Do
Feel the home that I live in.
                      La#
’cause I got too much life,
                   Fa              Do
Running through my veins, going to waste.

              Rem
I don’t wanna die,
Lam/Do                       La/Do#
  But I ain’t keen on living either.
La7                Solm
  Before I fall in love,
Rem/Fa             La
  I’m preparing to leave her.

                  Rem
I scare myself to death,
Lam/Do                 La/Do#
  That’s why I keep on running.
La7             Solm
  Before I’ve arrived,
Rem/Fa             La
  I can see myself coming.

             La#          Fa
I just wanna feel... real love,
                     Do
Feel the home that I live in.
                      La#
’cause I got too much life,
                   Fa              Do
Running through my veins, going to waste.

              La#          Fa
And I need to feel... real love
                Do
And a life ever after.
              Rem
I cannot get enough.

There’s a hole in my soul,
                     Fa                    Do
You can see it in my face, it’s a real big place.
