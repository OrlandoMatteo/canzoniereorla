       La#   Solm

La#
I was there to witness

Candice's inner business
    Solm
She wants the boys to notice

Her rainbows, and her ponies
La#
She was educated but could not count to ten
            Solm
Now she got lots of different horses

By lots of different men

And I say
La#
Liberate your sons and daughters
    Solm                               Fa/La
The bush is high but in the hole is water
La#
You can get some, when they give it
Solm                Re#    Fa
Nothing sacred, but it's a living

La#
Hey, ho, here she goes
         Solm7
Either a little too high or a little too low
    Re#
Low self-esteem and vertigo
                                     Fa
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy
La#
Hey, ho, here she goes
         Solm7
Either a little too loud or a little too close
      Re#
Got a hurricane at the back of her throat
                             Fa   La#   Solm
She thinks she's made of candy

La#
Ring a ring of roses

Whoever gets the closest
    Solm
She comes and she goes

As the war of the roses
La#
Mother was a victim

Father beat the system
   Solm
By moving bricks to Brixton

And learning how to fix them
La#
Liberate your sons and daughters
    Solm                                    Fa/La
The bush is high but in the hole there's water
La#
As you will she'll be the whole of the law
          Solm
And if it don't feel good
             Re#      Fa
What are you doing it for

Now tell me

La#
Hey, ho, here she goes
         Solm7
Either a little too high or a little too low
    Re#
Low self-esteem and vertigo
                                     Fa
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy

La#

           Solm
And if you don't feel good

What are you doing it for?
             La#
What are you doing it for?

What are you doing it for?
             Solm
What are you doing it for?

What are you doing it for?
             La#
What are you doing it for?

What are you doing it for?
