[<pre>Mi
I sit and wait 
                     La            Do#m  Si
does an angel contemplate my fate 
            Mi
and do they know
 
the places where we go 
                     La   Do#m Si
when we´re grey and old
               Fa#m
´cos I´ve been told 
           La               Do#m7          La
that salvation lets their wings unfold 
            Re
so when I’m lying in my bed 
         La/Do#   
thoughts running through my head
      Mi                       Re
and I feel that love is dead
           La/Do#        Mi
I’m loving angels instead


                 Si                     Do#m
and through it all she offers me protection 
                    La
a lot of love and affection 
                     Mi
whether I’m right or wrong
                   Si 
and down the waterfall
                 Do#m 
wherever it may take me 
                       La
I know that life wont break me
                Mi/Sol#            Fa#m      Re
when I come to call she wont forsake me 
           La/Do#            Mi
I’m loving angels instead 


Mi         
when I’m feeling weak 
                          La             Do#m Si
and my pain walks down a one way street
         Mi 
I look above 
                         La                Do#m  Si
and I know ill always be blessed with love
     Re     
and as the feeling grows 
              La/Do#
she breathes flesh to my bones
     Mi                 Re
and when love is dead 
           La/Do#       Mi
I’m loving angels instead 


               Si                   Do#m
and through it all she offers me protection 
                    La
a lot of love and affection 
                     Mi
whether I’m right or wrong
                   Si 
and down the waterfall
                 Do#m 
wherever it may take me 
                       La
I know that life wont break me
                Mi/Sol#            Fa#m       Re
when I come to call she wont forsake me 
           La/Do#       Mi
I’m loving angels instead
