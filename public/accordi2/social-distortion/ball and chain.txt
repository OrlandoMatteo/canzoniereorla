       Do#  Sol#  Fa#  Do#

          Do#                  Sol#
Well it's been ten years and a thousand tears
    Fa#                  Do#
And look at the mess I'm in
                    Sol#
A broken nose and a broken heart,
   Fa#            Do#
An empty bottle of gin
                 Sol#
Well I sit and I pray
      Fa#              Do#
In my broken down Chevrolet
                       Sol#
While I'm singin' to myself
        Fa#              Do#
There's got to be another way

      Do#        Sol#
Take away, take away
      Fa#              Do#
Take away this ball and chain
                        Sol#
Well I'm lonely and I'm tired
      Fa#                Do#
And I can't take any more pain
                 Sol#
Take away, take away
      Fa#       Do#
Never to return again
                 Sol#
Take away, take away
      Fa#
Take away
                        Do#  Sol#  Fa#  Do#
Take away this ball and chain

          Do#               Sol#
Well I've searched and I've searched
   Fa#             Do#
To find the perfect life
                      Sol#
A brand new car and a brand new suit
  Fa#                 Do#
I even got me a little wife
                    Sol#
But wherever I have gone
      Fa#                Do#
I was sure to find myself there
                     Sol#
You can run all your life
        Fa#  Do#
But not go anywhere

      Do#        Sol#
Take away, take away
      Fa#              Do#
Take away this ball and chain
                        Sol#
Well I'm lonely and I'm tired
      Fa#                Do#
And I can't take any more pain
                 Sol#
Take away, take away
      Fa#       Do#
Never to return again
                 Sol#
Take away, take away
      Fa#
Take away
                        Do#  Sol#  Fa#  Do#
Take away this ball and chain

Do#  Sol#  Fa#  Do#    Do#  Sol#  Fa#  Do#

          Do#                 Sol#
Well I'll pass the bar on the way
      Fa#        Do#
To my dingy hotel room
               Sol#
I spent all my money
          Fa#                     Do#
I've been drinkin' since half past noon
                            Sol#
Well I'll wake there in the mornin'
   Fa#                 Do#
Or maybe in the county jail
                        Sol#
Times are hard getting harder
            Fa#                 Do#
I'm born to lose and destined to fail

      Do#        Sol#
Take away, take away
      Fa#              Do#
Take away this ball and chain
                        Sol#
Well I'm lonely and I'm tired
      Fa#                Do#
And I can't take any more pain
                 Sol#
Take away, take away
      Fa#       Do#
Never to return again
                 Sol#
Take away, take away
      Fa#
Take away
                        Do#  Sol#  Fa#  Do#
Take away this ball and chain

Do#  Sol#  Fa#  Do#
