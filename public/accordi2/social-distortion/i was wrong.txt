       Re#  La#  Fam  Sol#

    Re#
Oh, when I was young
      La#
I was so full of fear
  Fam                    Sol#
I hid behind anger, held back the tears
       Re#
It was me against the world
      La#
I was sure that I'd win
        Fam
But the world fought back,
            Sol#
punished me for my sins
  Re#
I felt so alone
   La#
So insecure
  Fam                      Sol#
I blamed you instead, made sure I was heard
         Re#
And they tried to warn me
      La#
Of my evil ways
      Fam                     Sol#
But I wouldn't hear what they had to say

      Re#    La#
I was wrong
Fam                Sol#
Self destruction's got me again
      Re#    La#
I was wrong
  Fam              Sol#
I realize now that I was wrong

      Re#
And I think about my loves
           La#
Well, I've had a few
          Fam
Well, I'm sorry that I hurt them
      Sol#
Did I hurt you too?
  Re#
I took what I wanted
       La#
Put my heart on the shelf
    Fam                          Sol#
But how can you love me when you don't love yourself?
       Re#
It was me against the world
      La#
I was sure that I'd win
    Fam                            Sol#
The world fought back, punished me for my sins
         Re#
And they tried to warn me
      La#
Of my evil ways
      Fam                     Sol#

Self destruction's got me again
      Re#    La#
I was wrong
  Fam              Sol#
I realize now that I was wrong
      Re#   La#   Fam  Sol#
I was wrong,  yeah
      Re#   La#  Fam  Sol#
I was wrong

  La#
I grew up fast
      Fam
And I grew up hard
Sol#                          Re#
Something was wrong from the very start
      La#
I was fighting everybody
      Fam
I was fighting everything
        Sol#             Re#
But the only one that I hurt was me
        La#                   Fam
I got society's blood running down my face
Sol#                  Re#
Somebody help me get outta this place
La#                     Fam
How could someone's bad luck last so long?
  Sol#                 La#
Until I realized that I was wrong

Fam                Sol#
Self destruction's got me again
      Re#    La#
I was wrong
    Fam         Sol#
The only moment that I was me
      Re#
I was wrong
