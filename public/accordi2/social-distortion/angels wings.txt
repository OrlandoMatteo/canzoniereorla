How many times have you asked yourself
   Sol                        Mim       Re
Is this the hand of fate that I've been dealt?
       Sol
You're so disillusioned this can't be real
    Sol                     Mim     Re
And you can't stand now the way you feel

I triumphed in the face of adversity
    Sol                      Mim         Re
And I became the man I never thought I'd be
    Sol
And now my biggest challenge, a thing called love
