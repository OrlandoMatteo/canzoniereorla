 Hanging out behind the club at the weekends

 Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends
LA
 I couldn´t wait for the summer and the Warped Tour

 She´s getting kicked out of school
because she´s failing
RE
 I´m kind of nervous

´cause I think all her friends hate me
LA
 She´s the one, she´ll always be there
RE                         MI
 She took my hand and that made it I swear

with the girl at the rock show

She said "What"
      FA#m            RE
and I told her that I didn´t know
LA
She´s so cool

Everything´s better when she´s around
  MI                             RE
