
  MI                           LA
I got no regret right now (I'm feeling this)
    DO#m7                       LA
The air is so cold and low (I'm feeling this)
MI                         LA
Let me go in her room (I'm feeling this)
  DO#m                            LA
I wanna take off her clothes (I'm feeling this)
MI                          LA
Show me the way to bed (I'm feeling this)
DO#m7                         LA
Show me the way you move (I'm feeling this)
MI                             LA
Fuck it, it's such a blur (I'm feeling this)
  DO#m7                           LA
I love all the things you do (I'm feeling this)
MI        SI         DO#m
Fate fell short this time, 
           LA
your smile fades in the summer
MI         SI      DO#m
Place your hand in mine, 
     LA                  MI  
I'll leave when I wanna
MI
Where do we go from here?

Turn all the lights down now
                             LA
Smiling from ear to ear (I'm feeling this)
   DO#m7                           LA
My breathing has got too loud (I'm feeling this)
MI                             LA   
Show me the bedroom floor (I'm feeling this)
DO#m7                            LA
Show me the bathroom mirror (I'm feeling this)
      MI                            LA
We're taking this way too slow (I'm feeling this)
DO#m7                       LA
Take me away from here (I'm feeling this)
MI        SI         DO#m
Fate fell short this time, 
           LA
your smile fades in the summer
MI         SI      DO#m       LA
Place your hand in mine, I'll leave when I wanna
 MI
(Fate fell short this time, 

your smile fades in the summer)

(Place your hand in mine, 

I'll leave when I wanna)

This place was never the same again 

after you came and went

How could you say you meant anything different

To anyone standing alone on the street

With a cigarette on the first night we met
MI                     SI
Look to the past and remember and smile
    DO#m7               LA
And maybe tonight I can breathe for awhile
    MI                           SI
I'm not in the scene I think I'm falling asleep
         DO#m7 
But then all that it means is 
     LA 
I'll always be dreaming of you

MI        SI         DO#m
Fate fell short this time, 
           LA
your smile fades in the summer
MI         SI      DO#m
Place your hand in mine, 
           LA
I'll leave when I wanna
MI        SI         DO#m
Fate fell short this time, 
           LA
your smile fades in the summer
MI         SI      DO#m
Place your hand in mine,

I'll leave when I wanna
MI        SI         DO#m
Fate fell short this time, 
           LA
your smile fades in the summer

your smile fades in the summer

Place your hand in mine, 
           LA
I'll leave when I wanna...
