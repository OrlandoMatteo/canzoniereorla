You're such an inspiration for the ways
          DO#5                    MI5
That I'll never ever choose to be
DO#5                      MI5     
Oh so many ways for me to show you
         DO#5
How your savior has abandoned you
MI5         DO#5
Fuck your God

Your Lord and your Christ
MI5        DO#5
He did this

Took all you had and
MI5           DO#5
Left you this way

Still you pray, you never stray
      MI5          DO#5
Never taste of the fruit

You never thought to question why

     DO#5-        DO#5
It's not like you killed someone
     DO#5-        DO#5
It's not like you drove

a hateful spear into his side
DO#5-      DO#5
Praise the one who left you

Broken down and paralyzed
   DO#
He did it all for you
