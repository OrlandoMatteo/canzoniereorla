Yes, I do, I believe

That one day I will be where I was
                            LA
Right there, right next to you
               
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
                                              
The moon, and the stars are nothing without you
     MI7+                 
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
                                           LA
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
                                         
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
                                    
These tears, they tell their own story
FA#m           LA           DO#m      SI
Told me not to cry when you were gone
        FA#m          LA
But the feeling's overwhelming, 
            MI/SI LA/SI
it's much too  strong

    MI             DO#m7        FA#m7  LAadd9
Can I lay by your side, next to you?   You
    MI                 DO#m7
And make sure you're alright
                  FA#m7   
I'll take care of you
      LA 
And I don't want to be here 
   LA/SI              MI
if I can't be with you tonight

    MI7+ 
I'm reaching out to you
               LAadd9      
Can you hear my call, boy?
     MI7+
This hurt that I've been through
                                
I'm missing you, 
                 LAadd9        LA/SI
I'm missing you like crazy, you

      MI     SI/RE# DO#m7
Can I lay by your   side? 
        FA#m7   LA  
Next to you, to you
    MI              SI/RE# DO#m7
And make sure you're al----right
                  FA#m7
I'll take care of you
      LA
And I don't want to be here 
   LA/SI              
if I can't be with you 


FA#m  LA6  RE7+  SI9
  tonight...
    FA#m   LA6     RE7+  SI9
Oh, lay me down tonight
FA#m   LA6      RE7+  SI9
Lay me by your side
FA#m   LA6 RE7+  SI9
Lay me down   tonight
FA#m   LA6     SI7/4
Lay me by your side


    MI            DO#m7         FA#m7/4
Can I lay by your side? Next to you, 
LAadd9   LA/SI   MI
you...
