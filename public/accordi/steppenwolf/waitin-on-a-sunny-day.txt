DO  LAm  FAadd9  DO SOL

     DO                                     LAm
It's rainin' but there ain't a cloud in the sky
                            FAadd9
Musta been a tear from your eye
                  DO  SOL
Everything'll be okay
 DO                                 LAm
Funny thought I felt a sweet summer breeze
                          FAadd9
Musta been you sighin' so deep
                               DO   SOL
Don't worry we're gonna find a way

    DO                          LAm
I'm waitin', waitin' on a sunny day
                        FAadd9
Gonna chase the clouds away
                   DO   SOL  DO
Waitin' on a sunny day

   DO                                         LAm
Without you I'm workin' with the rain fallin' down
                          FAadd9
Half a party in a one dog town
                               DO   SOL
I need you to chase the blues away
   DO                                            LAm
Without you I'm a drummer girl that can't keep a beat
                                   FAadd9
And ice cream truck on a deserted street
                              DO   SOL
I hope that you're coming to stay

    DO                          LAm
I'm waitin', waitin' on a sunny day
                        FAadd9
Gonna chase the clouds away
                   DO   SOL  
Waitin' on a sunny day


RE  SIm  SOL  RE LA  MI  SOL


DO                                         LAm
Hard times baby, well they come to tell us all
                                        FAadd9
Sure as the tickin' of the clock on the wall
                                       DO  SOL
Sure as the turnin' of the night into day
     DO                                         LAm
Your smile girl, brings the mornin' light to my eyes
                             FAadd9
Lifts away the blues when I rise
                              DO   SOL
I hope that you're coming to stay

    DO                          LAm
I'm waitin', waitin' on a sunny day
                        FAadd9
Gonna chase the clouds away
                   DO   SOL  
Waitin' on a sunny day
