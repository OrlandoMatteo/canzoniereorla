FA   LAm   FA   LAm   

      FA
I was bruised and battered I couldn't

tell what I felt
     LAm
I was  unrecognizable to myself
       FA
saw my  reflection in a window and didn't

know my own face
                 LAm
oh brother are you gonna leave me

wasting like this on the
            SIbadd9      FA/LA   DO
streets of Philadelphia...

SIbadd9  FA/LA  DO

        FA
I walked the avenue 'til my legs

felt like stone
        LAm
I heard  voices of friends

vanished and gone
           FA
At night I  hear the blood

in my veins
       LAm
just as  black and whispery

as the rain
                    SIbadd9     FA/LA  DO
on the streets of Philadelphia....

SIbadd9  FA/LA  DO

SIb                          REm
  Ain't no angel gonna greet me
SIb                         FA
  It's just you and I my friend
LAm                        SIb
  and my clothes don't fit me no more, I walked
DO
  A thousand miles just to slip this skin

FA
  The night is falling, I'm

lying awake
     LAm
I can  feel my self

fading away
     FA
so receive me brother with your

fateless kiss or
       LAm
will we  leave each other

alone like this
                    SIbadd9      FA/LA  DO
on the streets of Philadelphia...

SIbadd9  FA/LA  DO
