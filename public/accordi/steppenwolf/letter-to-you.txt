'Neath a crowd of mongrel trees 

I pulled that bothersome thread
                                       
Got down on my knees, grabbed my pen and bowed my head
         FA#m                           LAadd9
Tried to summon all that my heart finds true

And send it in my letter to you

Things I found out through hard times and good
                               
I wrote ’em all out in ink and blood
         FA#m                          LAadd9
Dug deep in my soul and signed my name true

All my happiness and all my pain
            FA#m7                             LAadd9
The dark evеning stars and the morning sky of blue
