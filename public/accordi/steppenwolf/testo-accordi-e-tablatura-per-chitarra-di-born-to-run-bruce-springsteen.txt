       MI                       
In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a
LA                 SI
runaway American dream
   MI                          
At night we ride through mansions of glory in                 
LA          SI
suicide  machines
LA                   SOL#m
Sprung from cages on Highway 9
       FA#m                        SOL#m
chrome wheeled, fuel injected and, steppin'
             MI   E9
out over the line Ohhh
LA                      SOL#m
Baby this town rips the bones from your back
       FA#m               SOL#m   
it's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
         MI                  DOm#7
we gotta get out while we're young
       LA
'Cause tramps like us

Wendy, let me in, I wanna be your friend,
        LA                    SI
I wanna guard your dreams and visions
     MI
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims,
    LA                         SI
And strap your hands across my engines
        LA            SOL#m
And Together we could break this trap,
      FA#m
We'll run till we drop and
SOL#m             MI
baby we'll never go back
MI9         LA                      SOL#m
Oh will you walk with me out on the wire?
       FA#m                         SOL#m
'cause baby I'm just a scared and a lonely rider
      MI                DO#m7
But I gotta know how it feels,
          LA
I want to know if love is wild, baby,
  SI                      MI    LA/MI  SI/MI

On a last chance power drive
     MI

But there's no place left to hide
  LA                    SOL#m
Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness
     FA#m                  SOL#m         MI
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
MI9  LA                    SOL#m
Oh.. someday girl, I don't know when

         SOL#m        MI
Where we really wanna go

And we'll walk in the sun
              LA
but till then tramps like us
SI                   MI   DO#m7  LA
