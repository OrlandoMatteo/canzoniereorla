MI7         RE LA

MI7                                  RE LA
 I don't know why I love her like I do
MI7                          RE   LA
 All the changes you put me through
MI7                     RE   LA
 Take my money, my cigarettes
MI7                             RE 
 I haven't seen the worst of it yet


LA      DO             SOL   
I want to know that you'll tell me
LA        MIm7
I love to stay


               MI7
Take me to the river, drop me in the water

Take me to the river, dip me in the water

Washing me down, washing me down...

 Think of all the things we could have had

 Love is an ocean that I can't forget
MI7                               RE
 My sweet sixteen I would never regret

Push me to the river, dip me in the water

Washing me down, washing me...
DO#m    LA          DO#m     LA        MIm7
 Hug me, squeeze me, love me, tease me

'Til I can't, 'til I can't, 
 
'til I can't take no more of it
               MI7

 Sixteen candles there on my wall
MI7                                     RE
