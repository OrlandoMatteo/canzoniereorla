We're still struggling

Halfway through this journey

We are not afraid the thrill is on

Speed up without any brakes, oh no
       SIm       MIm      SOL             FA#7/4
'Cause sometimes we still have to hit the wall
       SIm             MIm              SOL  FA#7/4
To see things that are right before our eyes
