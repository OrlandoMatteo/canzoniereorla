Do you remember my friend

When I was frozen and dead inside

A piece of nothing in this world
                 REm
Till I heard she said

        LAm      DO
Three nights of hell
     SOL           REm
Immortality spell (spell)
        LAm   DO
Light up the sky
        SOL               LAm
Make it through the darkness

Can you believe this my friend

I was empty and broken inside

She came to save me from the storm
                 REm     
When I heard she said

       LAm        DO
Three nights of hell
     SOL           REm
Immortality spell (spell)
       LAm     DO
Light up the sky
        SOL              REm
Make it through the darkness
           LAm    DO
Three nights of hell
     SOL           REm
