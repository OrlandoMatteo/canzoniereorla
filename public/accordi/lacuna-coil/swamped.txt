MI5                     
Destiny flying high above
      DO/MI                   MI5
All I know is that you can realize
                  
Destiny who cares As it turns around
      DO/MI                         MI5
And I know that it descends down on me

It's just another day
    RE       MI
The shame is gone
               DO
Hard to believe
          RE        MI
That I've let it go...

MI5             
Destiny can't replace my life
      DO/MI                   MI5
Scary shadows of my past are alive
                     
Destiny who cares as it turns around
      DO/MI                        MI5
And I know that it descends with a smile

The shame is gone

Hard to believe
          RE         MI
That I've let it go away
                  DO
It's just a melody
   RE        MI
It bleeds in me
               DO
Hard to believe
          RE     MI
That I've let it go
