History recalls how great the fall can be
      SOL7
While everybody's sleeping, 
     DO7+
the boats put out to sea
FA7+                    REm6+
 Borne on the wings of time
              MIm                     LAm7
It seemed the answers were so easy to find
    REm7                 SOL  
"To late, " the prophets cry
             DO7+                       SIbadd9/RE
The island's sinking, let's take to the sky
LAm                    REm7/LA
Called the man a fool, striped him of his pride
SOL7                       DO7+
Everyone was laughing up until the day he died
FA7+                       REm6+
 And though the wound went deep
           MIm                    LAm7
Still he's calling us out of our sleep
   REm7                SOL7
My friends, we're not alone
            DO7+                    SIbadd9/RE
He waits in silence to lead us all home

       SOL7/RE          REm  
Well I know, I know, I know
        SOL7/RE                           REm7
And you tell me that you've many seeds to sow
        SOL7/RE        SIb   DO   SOL   FA6
Well I know, I know, I know...

Can you see the parts that I'm playing
 REm

Joker Man, Spider Man, Blue Eyed Meanie"
MIb
