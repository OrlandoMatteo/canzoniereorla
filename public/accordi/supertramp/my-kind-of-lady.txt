FA#m                       SIm7
 I was so down and then as foolish as it seems
    MI6           MI

This time we feel that we belong
           MI9        FA#m
Now we can truly say
           FA#m7             SIm7

           SIm7              
that's the way it's gonna be
    MI6               MI

    MI6         MI
Can make us be apart
