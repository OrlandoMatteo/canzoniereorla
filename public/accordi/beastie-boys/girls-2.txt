FA    REm                   FA     REm
Girls, all I really want is girls
                        FA     REm
And in the morning it's girls
                           FA    
'Cause in the evening it's girls

                         FA    REm
I like the way that they walk
                             FA    REm
And it's chilly to hear them talk
                          FA     REm
And I can always make 'em smile
                         FA
From White Castle to the Nile

            FA   REm
Back in the day
                               FA   REm
There was this girl around the way
                          FA   REm
She liked my home-piece MCA
                              FA    REm
He said he would not give her play
                                  FA   REm
I asked him, please? He said "You may"
                                 FA   REm
Her pants were tight and that's OK
                            FA   REm
If she would dance, I would DJ
                           FA
We took a walk down to the bay

              FA   REm
I hope she'll say
                                FA    REm
"Hey, me and you should hit the hay"
                              FA   REm
I asked her out, she said "No way"
                                   FA   REm
I should of probably guessed their gay
                           FA   REm
So I broke north with no delay
                            FA   REm
I heard she moved real far away
                            FA   REm
That was two years ago this May
                          FA
I seen her just the other day...

                            FA    
Jockin' Mike D to my dismay

FA            
Girls, to do the dishes
      
Girls, to clean up my room
                  
Girls, to do the laundry

Girls, and in the bathroom
FA    REm                          FA    REm 
Girls, that's all I really want is girls
                      FA    REm
Two at a time, I want girls
                              FA    REm
With new wave hairdos, I want girls
 
I ought to whip out my
FA            REm
Girls, girls, girls, girls,
FA            REm
Girls, girls, girls, girls,
FA            REm           FA
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls
