Let me get some action from the back section
SIb                  MIb
We need body rocking not perfection
         SIb                      MIb
Let your back bone flip but don't slip a disc
             SIb               MIb
And let your spine unwind just take a risk
  SIb                          MIb
I wanna do the freak until the break of dawn
SIb                     MIb
Tell me party people is that so wrong
    SIb              MIb
The ship is docking, inter-lockin'
SIb             MIb
And up-rockin' electro-shocking
SIb                   MIb
We're getting down computer action
SIb            MIb
Do the robotic satisfaction
SIb              MIb
All of y'all get off the wall
SIb                
Have a ball and get involved with

 Flame on, I'm gone
SIb                 MIb
I'm so sweet like a nice bon bon
SIb                   MIb
Came out rapping when I was born
SIb                       MIb
Mom said rock it 'til the break of dawn
SIb                               MIb
Puttin' bodies in motion 'cause I got the notion
     SIb                  MIb
Like Roy Cormier with the coconut lotion
    SIb                       MIb
The sound of the music makin' you insane
            SIb
You can't explain 
               MIb
to people this type of mind frame
           SIb
And like a bottle of Chateau Neuf Du Pap

I'm fine like wine when I start to rap

We need body rockin' not perfection

Mike D with the master plan

Oh, my my and thank you ma'am

And when I grab the mic you scream, "Oh, god damn"
    
The creme de la creme is who I am
  SIb     MIb
MCA where have you been
SIb                  MIb
Packed like sardines in the tin
   SIb                         MIb
So kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins
       SIb                           SIb
'Cause when it comes to quarries I'm known to swim
  SIb
Adrock light up the place

And if you pull my card you pull the ace

And if you ask me turn up the bass

And if you play defender I could be your hyper space
