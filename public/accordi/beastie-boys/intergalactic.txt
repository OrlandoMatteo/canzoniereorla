Well, now, don't you tell me to smile
                    
You stick around I'll make it worth your while
   
My number's beyond what you can dial
FA                          SI7
Maybe it's because we're so versatile

Style, profile, I said

It always brings me back when I hear, "ooh, child!"

From The Hudson River out to the Nile
  FA                      SI7
I run the marathon to the very last mile
             MIm
Well, if you battle me I feel reviled

People always sayin' my style is wild

You've got gall, you've got guile
FA               SI7
Step to me I'm a rap-o-phile

If you want to battle you're in denial
MIm

Go ahead, put my rhymes on trial

Cast you off into exile

Jazz and A.W.O.L, that's our team

Step inside the party, disrupt the whole scene

When it comes to beats, well, I'm a fiend

I like my sugar with coffee and cream
        MIm
Well, I gotta keep it going keep it going full steam

Too sweet to be sour to nice to be mean

Well, on the tough-guy style I'm not too keen

Trying to change the world, I'm going to plot and scheme

Kick off your shoes and relax your socks

The rhymes are spread just like a pox

Now when I wrote graffiti my name was Slop

If my rap's soup, my beats is stock

Step from the table when I start to chop

I'm a lumberjack DJ Adrock
  
If you try to knock me you'll get mocked

I'll stir fry you in my wok

Your knees'll start shakin' and your fingers pop

Like a pinch on the neck of Mr. Spock
