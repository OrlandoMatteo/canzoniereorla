An offering of reasons
                   DO/RE  SOL REm
We put them all in play
              DO/RE   SOL 
A covering of treasons
     REm                     DO/RE  SOL SOLm
That one by one we let slip away
           REm     SOLm
A solitary dancer
                 REm    SIb
So lost upon her stage
       DO              REm  DO SIb
I have seen you on the edge of dawn
         DO           REm DO   SIb
Felt you there before you were born
              DO              REm  DO SIb
Balanced your dreams upon the edge of thorns
                               REm   DO/RE  SOL
But I don't think about you anymore

 A study made from winter
                 DO/RE   SOL REm
Of summers long ago
                        DO/RE   SOL
And dreams that used to glitter
REm                     DO/RE   SOL SOLm
Safely now hidden under snow
                  REm     SOLm
And so we end the chapter
                     REm       SIb
And let the stage lights fade
       DO              REm  DO SIb
I have seen you on the edge of dawn
         DO           REm DO   SIb
Felt you there before you were born
              DO              REm  DO SIb
Balanced your dreams upon the edge of thorns
                                 REm
But I don't think about you anymore
