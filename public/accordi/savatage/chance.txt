He was standing all alone
SIm                LA/SI
Trying to find the words to say
     SIm             LA/SI
When every prayer he ever prayed
    SIm    LA/SI
Was gone
        SIm               LA/SI
And the dreams he's never owned
SIm              LA/SI
Are still safely tucked away
  SIm          LA/SI
Until tomorrow he just

RE#5                             DO#5
 See the Devil in the streets at night
RE#5                            DO#5
 See him running in the pouring rain
RE#5                               
 See him grinning 'neath a twisted light
SI5             RE#5
I'll be back again
                             DO#5
See the people standing in a row
RE#5                              DO#5
 See them nodding like a field of grain
RE#5
 No one sees the sickle though
SI5                FA#5
Coming across the plain
                           
And this he knows if nothing more

That waiting in the dark like destiny
          
Are those who kissed the dogs of war
    DO#      SI5
And there is no tomorrow
DO#5
No tomorrow
       RE#5     
Take a chance  ...Take a chance

RE#5                      DO#5
 See the Devil he is so intense
RE#5                             DO#5
 See the Devil go and change his name
RE#5                          
 What's the going price of innocence
SI5               RE#5
It can't be the same
                            DO#5
Is it dark when the moon is down
RE#5                      DO#5
 Is it dark with a single flame
RE#5 
 If there's glass falling all all around
SI5          FA#5
I am not to blame

And this he knows if nothing more

That waiting in the dark like destiny

Are those who kissed the dogs of war
    DO#5     SI5
And there is no tomorrow
DO#5               RE#5
No tomorrow take a chance...

Pictures at an exhibition

Played as he stood his trance

Staring at his inhibitions

All the time believing

That it now came down to nothing

Tell me what you  be--lieve
SOL#m
I believe in nothing

Never really had to

In regards to your life

Rumors that are not true

Who's defending evil

Surely never I

Who would be the witness
                      
Should you chance to die

Father can you hear me

This is not how was meant to be

I am safe and so are you

As for the others destiny...

I believe that situations

All depend on circumstance...

Look away ...Look away
