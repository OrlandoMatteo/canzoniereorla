DO#m               SI/DO#
   It doesn't make any sense
SOL#m/DO#      LA/DO#
   This tragic ending
DO#m               SI/DO#
   In spite of the evidence
        SOL#m/DO#       LA/DO#
There's something still missing
DO#m               SI/DO#
 Heard some of the rumors told
SOL#m       LA/DO#
 A taste of one's wealth
DO#m          SI/DO#
 Did Victoria wound his soul?
SOL#m            LA/DO#
Did she bid him farewell?

         DO#m  SI
One last time
          SOL#m7  LA
We'll lay down  today
         DO#m  SI
One last time
         SOL#m7 LA
Until we fade  away
         DO#m  SI
One last time
          SOL#m7  LA
We'll lay down  today
         DO#m   SI/RE#
One last time
          SOL#m LA      FA#7/4
We slowly fade away... away

LAadd9                    SIadd9
     Here I am inside his  home
LAadd9                          FA#
     It holds the many clues to my suspicions
LAadd9                             SIadd9
     And as I'm standing here right  now
    DOadd9              RE
I'm finally shown what I have always known
LAadd9                    SIadd9
    Coincidence I can't believe
      FA#m             MI          RE     MI
As my childhood dreams slowly come true


SOL                  LA
  Are these her memories
                    SIm
Awakened through my eyes
               SOL#m7/5-             
This house has brought back to life


FA    SOL/FA
      An open door


LAb               SIb/LAb
I walk on through into this outro 
DOm          DOm/SIb
  Feeling as cold as outside
    FAm                     LAb/MIb
The walls disappear to some woman who's screaming
REm7/5-
A man pleads forgiveness
    REb            DOadd9    DOm
His words I cannot hear
