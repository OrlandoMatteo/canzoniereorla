SIbadd9                   
Strange face, with your eyes
MIb     SIbadd9        
 So pale and sincere
                         
Underneath you know well
MIb             SIbadd9
 You have nothing to fear
MIb         SIbadd9      MIb         SIbadd9
 For the dreams that came to you when so young
MIb  SIbadd9        
 Told of a life
LAb/DO  SIbadd9               
 Where spring is sprung
                        
You would seem so frail
MIb        SIbadd9
 In the cold of the night
                    
When the armies of emotion
MIb   SIbadd9     MIb
 Go out to fight
        SIbadd9   MIb            SIbadd9
But while the earth sinks to its grave
MIb     SIbadd9       LAb/DO
 You sail to the sky
                  SIbadd9
On the crest of a wave

      SIbadd9
So forget this cruel world
MIb     SIbadd9
 Where I belong
                       
I'll just sit and wait
MIb     SIbadd9      MIb
  And sing my song
        SIbadd9           MIb           SIbadd9
And if one day you should see me in the crowd
MIb           SIbadd9       LAb/DO
 Lend a hand and lift me
             SIbadd9
To your place in the cloud...
