 I never felt magic crazy as this
MIb                         FAm7
 I never saw moons knew the meaning of the sea
MIb                          FAm7
 I never held emotion in the palm of my hand
MIb                      FAm7
 Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree
        SIb 
But now you're here
            REb  LAb  MIb   FAm7   MIb   FAm7
Brighten my northern sky

MIb                                FAm7
 I've been a long time that I'm waiting
MIb                 FAm7
 Been a long that I'm blown
MIb                              FAm7
 I've been a long time that I've wandered
MIb                        FAm7
 Through the people I have known
       SIb
Oh, if you would and you could
                  REb  LAb MIb   FAm7   MIb   FAm7
Straighten my new mind's eye

MIb              FAm7
 Would you love me for my money
MIb              FAm7
 Would you love me for my head
MIb               FAm7
 Would you love me through the winter
MIb               FAm7
 Would you love me 'til I'm dead
    SIb
Oh, if you would and you could
          REb       LAb  MIb   FAm7   MIb   FAm7
Come blow your horn on high

MIb                 FAm7
