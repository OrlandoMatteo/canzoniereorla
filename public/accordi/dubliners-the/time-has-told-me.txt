You're a rare, rare find
          FA     REm
A troubled cure
             SOL     FA
For a troubled mind

Someday our ocean
     REm7  SOL         MI7
Will find   its shore
                      MIb7
So I'll leave the ways that are making me be
LAb                RE7           SOL
 What I really don't want to be
MI7            MIb7
 Leave the ways that are making me love

You came with the dawn
      FA                 REm
A soul with no footprint
      SOL             FA
A rose with no thorn
          DO             FA
Your tears they tell me
                 DO    DO9
There's really no way
              FA        REm
Of ending your troubles
     REm7  SOL    
With things you can say
FA       DO             FA
 And time will tell you
             DO     DO9
To stay by my side
          FA      REm
To keep on trying
                    SOL       MI7
'Til there's no more to hide
                           MIb7
So leave the ways that are making you be
LAb                   RE7         SOL
 What you really don't want to be
MI7                      MIb7
 Leave the ways that are making you love
