DO   

DOm                     MIb9
 Betty came by on her way
                         LAb
Said she had a word to say
                  DO
About things today
                  DOm
And fallen leaves
                           MIb9
Said she hadn't heard the news
                         LAb
Hadn't had the time to choose
              DO
A way to lose
                  DOm
But she believes
                          MIb9
Going to see the river man
                          LAb
Going to tell him all I can
                DOadd9
About the plan
               DOm9
For lilac time
                        MIb9
If he tells me all he knows
                          LAb
About the way his river flows
                    DO
And all night shows
              DO7/4+
In summertime

LAb    DO    LAb    DO

DOm9                        MIb9
 Betty said she prayed today
                         LAb
For the sky to blow away
               DOadd9
Or maybe stay
                DOm9
She wasn't sure
                                  MIb9
For when she thought of summer rain
                          LAb
Calling for her mind again
                  DOadd9
She lost the pain
                    DOm9
And stayed for more
                         MIb9
Going to see the river man
                          LAb
Going to tell him all I can
               DOadd9
About the ban
                 DOm9
On feeling free
                          MIb9
If he tells me all he knows
                          LAb
About the way his river flows
                DO7/4+
I don't suppose
                 DO9
It's meant for me
DO9                       DOm7/9
Oh, how they come and go
              DOadd9    DO7/4+
Oh, how they come and go
