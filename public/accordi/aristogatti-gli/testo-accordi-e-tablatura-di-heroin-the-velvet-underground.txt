    I..  don't know...
               DO#   FA#   DO#   FA#
just where I'm going
    DO#  FA#     DO#         FA#          DO#
But I'm... gonna try for the kingdom if I can
                FA#             DO#
Cos it makes me feel like I'm a man
             FA#           DO#
When I put a spike into my vein
              FA#                     DO#
And I tell ya things aren't quite the same
         FA#           DO#
When I'm rushing on my run
      FA#                   DO#
And I feel just like Jesus' son

      FA#                     DO#
And I guess that I just don't know
      FA#                     DO#
And I guess that I just don't know...

I...... have made...
        DO#    FA#   DO#   FA#
a big decision
DO#  FA#       DO#  FA#              DO#
I'm....  gonna try.... to nullify my life
             FA#             DO#
Cos when the blood begins to flow
       FA#                     DO#
And it shoots up the dropper's neck
         FA#           DO#
When I'm closing in on death

  You can't help me not you guys
                  FA#                       DO#
Oh, all you sweet girls with all your sweet talk
        FA#           DO#
You can all go take a walk

      FA#                     DO#
And I guess that I just don't know
      FA#                     DO#
And I guess that I just don't know...

  I.... wish that....
                             DO#  FA#  DO#  FA#
I was born a thousand years ago
DO#  FA#    DO#  FA#                        DO#
  I... wish that... I'd sailed the darkened seas
     FA#               DO#
On a great big clipper ship
           FA#               DO#
Going from this land here to that
         FA#               DO#
Oh, in a sailor's suit and cap
 
FA#  DO#  FA#
 
DO#    FA#            DO# 
  Away from the big city
        FA#            DO#
Where a man can not be free
           FA#           DO#
Of all the evils of this town
          FA#             DO#
And of himself and those around

          FA#                     DO#
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know
          FA#                     DO#
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know

Her______ oin....
                      DO#  FA#  DO#  FA#
it'll be the death of me
DO#  FA#   DO#           FA#               DO#
Her______ oin... it's my wife, and it's my life
          FA#            DO#
Because a mainline to my vein
           FA#          DO#
Leads to a center in my head
             FA#           DO#
And then I'm better off as dead
 
FA#  DO#  FA#  DO#

FA#  DO#  FA#  DO#  FA#  DO#  FA#  DO#
 
             FA#             DO#
Cos when the smack begins to flow
      FA#                  DO#
Oh, I really don't care anymore
              FA#              DO#
'Bout all the jim-jims in this town
                FA#                  DO#
And all the politicians making crazy sounds
              FA#                    DO#
And everybody puttin' everybody else down
                 FA#                DO#
And all the dead bodies piled up in Nam

And I really don't care anymore

When that heroin is in my blood
        FA#            DO#
And the blood is in my head
             FA#                     DO#
Then I thank God that I'm as good as dead
               FA#               DO#
And thank your God that I'm not aware
          FA#                   DO#
And thank God that I just don't care
      FA#                     DO#
And I guess that I just don't know
      FA#                     DO#
And I guess that I just don't know
