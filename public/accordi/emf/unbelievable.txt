Oh
      SOL#5    SI5 DO#5 SOL#5
What?
SI5     DO#5
What... was that?

    SOL#5
You burden me with your questions
      DO#5
You'd have me tell no lies
       SOL#5
You're always asking what it's all about
          DO#5
But don't listen to my replies
    SOL#5
You say to me I don't talk enough
    DO#5
But when I do I'm a fool
      SOL#5
These times I've spent, I've realized
             DO#5
I'm going to shoot through and leave you


    SOL#
The things you say
     DO#               RE#
Your purple prose just give you away
    SOL#            DO#
The things you say     You're unbelievable 


SOL#5    SI5 DO5 DO#5    SI5  LA5 
(oh)...
SOL#5    SI5 DO5 DO#5    SI5  LA5

    SOL#5
You burden me with your problems
   DO#5
By telling me more than mine
    SOL#5
I'm always so concerned
         DO#5
With the way you say you always have to stop


   SOL#
To think of us being one
   DO#7             RE#7
Is more than I ever know
SOL#  
But this time, I realize
             DO#7              RE#7           
I'm going to shoot through and leave you

SOL#5
Seemingly lastless, don't mean you can ask us

Pushing down the relative, 

bringing out your higher self

Think of the fine times, 

pushing down the better few

Instead of bringing out the clues 
                      SOL#5
to what the world and everything you answer to
SI5                     DO#5
Brace yourself with the greatest of ease
  SI5                   SOL#5        SI5  DO#5  SI5
I know this world ain't what it seems
    SOL#5
You burden me with your questions
      DO#5
You'd have me tell no lies
