Well my mama she didn't 'low me, 
                                         LA7
just to stay out all night long, oh Lord

Well my mama didn't 'low me, 
                           LA7
just to stay out all night long
         RE7                         
I didn't care what she didn't 'low, I would

Boogie-woogie Anyhow

When I first came to town people, 
                                   
I was walkin' down Hastings Street
                          
Everybody was talkin' about, the Henry Swing Club

I decided I drop in there that night
                          RE7
When I got there, I say, "Yes, people"
                              LA7
They was really havin' a ball!

Yes, I know Boogie Chillun

LA7     RE7    LA7

One night I was layin' down,

I heard mama 'n papa talkin'
   
I heard papa tell mama, let that boy boogie-woogie,

It's in him, and it got to come out
      RE7
And I felt so good,
                               LA7
Went on boogie'n just the same...
