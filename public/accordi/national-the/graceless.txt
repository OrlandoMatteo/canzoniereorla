DO#m      MI  LA
Graceless
          MI           DO#m    MI  LA
Is there a powder to erase this?
      MI            DO#m   MI   LA
Is it dissolvable and tasteless?
           MI          DO#m   MI  
You can't imagine how I hate this
LA        MI
Graceless
    SI                DO#m   MI  LA7+
I'm trying, but I'm graceless
             MI            DO#m   MI   LA7+
Don't have the sunny side to face this
        MI       DO#m    MI   LA7+
I am invisible and weightless
          MI           DO#m  MI  
You can't imagine how I hate this
LA7+      MI
Graceless
    SI               MI
I'm trying, but I'm gone
                        LA7+
Through the glass again
                      MI
Just come and find me
                     LA7+ 
God loves everybody, don't remind me
MI                       LA7+
 I took the medicine and I went missing
MI                           SI
 Just let me hear your voice, just let me listen
DO#m      MI   LA7+
Graceless

          MI           DO#m  MI   LA7+
I figured out how to be faithless
             MI          DO#m    MI   LA7+
But it would be a shame to waste this
           MI          DO#m  MI  
You can't imagine how I hate this
LA7+    MI
Graceless

All of my thoughts of you
LA7+
Bullets through rotten fruit
MI
Come apart at the seams
LA7+
Now I know what dying means
MI
I am not my rosy self
LA7+
Left my roses on my shelf
MI
Take the white ones, they're my favorites
SI
It's the side effects that save us
MI      LA7+

                              MI   LA7+
Put the flowers you find in a vase
                                           MI
If you're dead in the mind it'll brighten the place
LA7+                                   MI
 Don't let them die on the vine, it's a waste
SI

          MI                         LA7+
There's a science to walking through windows
          MI                         LA7+
There's a science to walking through windows
          MI                         LA7+
There's a science to walking through windows
          MI                         SI
There's a science to walking through windows without you
