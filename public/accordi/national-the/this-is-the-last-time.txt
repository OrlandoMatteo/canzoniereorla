SOL   RE   SOL   RE

SOL                 
When I think of you in the city
    RE
The sight of you among the sites
  SOL
I get this sudden sinking feeling
RE
Of a man about to fly
LAm7
Never kept me up before
RE
Now I've been awake for days
LAm7
I can't fight it anymore
    RE
I'm going through an awkward phase
SOL
I am secretly in love with
RE
Everyone that I grew up with
SOL
Do my crying underwater
RE
I can't get down any farther
LAm7
All my drowning friends can see
RE
Now there is no running from it
LAm7
It's become the crux of me
  RE
I wish that I could rise above it

           SOL
But I stay down
        RE
With my demons
       SOL
I stay down
        RE
With my demons

SOL
Passing buzzards in the sky
RE
Alligators in the sewers
SOL
I don't even wonder why
RE
Hide among the under views
LAm7
Huddle with them all night long
    RE
The worried talk to god goes on
LAm7
I sincerely tried to love it
RE
Wish that I could rise above it

           SOL
But I stay down
        RE
With my demons
       SOL
I stay down
        RE
With my demons
       LAm7
I stay down
        RE
With my demons
       LAm7
I stay down
        RE
With my demons

MIm      
Can I stay here? I can sleep
RE
On the floor
MIm
Paint the blood and hang the palms
RE
On the door
MIm                           RE
Do not think I'm going places anymore
MIm                        RE
Wanna see the sun come up above New York
    LAm7     
Oh, everyday I start so great
RE
Then the sunlight dims
LAm7
Less I've learned
                   RE
The more I see the pythons and the limbs
LAm7                      
Do not know what's wrong with me
RE
Sours in the cup
LAm7
When I walk into a room
 RE
I do not light it up  ...Fuck

          MIm
So I stay down
        RE
With my demons
       MIm
I stay down
        RE
With my demons
       LAm7
I stay down
        RE
With my demons
       LAm7
I stay down
        RE        MIm
With my demons
