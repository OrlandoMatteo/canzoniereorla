Mama said that it was quite alright

Our kind of people had a bed for the night
             FA
And it was okay

Mama told us we were good kids
                        REm            SOLm

Remember asking both my mom and dad
             FA/LA         SIb
Why we never travelled to exotic lands
                    SOLm
We only ever really visit friends
           FA/LA         SIb
Nothing to tell when the summer ends
                     SOLm
We never really went buying clothes
MIb                                SIb
Folks were passing on the stuff in plenty loads
                 SOLm
New shoes once a year and then
            FA/LA            SIb
Out to play ball so we could ruin them

Don't get me wrong I didn't have it bad
             FA/LA          SIb
I got enough loving from my mom and dad
                              SOLm
But I don't think they really understood
                    FA/LA           SIb
When I said that I wanted a deal in Hollywood
                           SOLm
I told them I'd be singing on TV
    MIb                          SIb
The other kids were calling me a wannabe
                            SOLm
The older kids they started bugging me
                    FA/LA             SIb
But now they're all standing right in front of me

 I know which place I'm from, I know my home
SOLm         DO7/MI
 When I'm in doubt and struggling
MIb             SIb
 That's where I go

An old friend can give advice

Where new friends only know a half story

I said, I'm OK
