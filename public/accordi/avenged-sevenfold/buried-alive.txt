Take the time just to listen
         FA                   MI
When the voices screaming are much too loud
LAm          SOL/SI DO
 Take a look in the distance
        FA     MI
Try and see it all
LAm         SOL/SI   DO
Chances are that you might find
        FA               MI
That we share a common discomfort now
LAm            SOL/SI DO
 I feel I'm walking a fine line
        FA           MI
Tell me only if it's real
REm       DO    SOL
Still I'm on my way (On and on it goes)

Vacant hope to ta----ke

Hey, I can't live in here for another day
LAm      MI5 FA                MI/SOL#
Darkness has kept the light concealed
MI5  RE5 FA5 MI5
Grim as  e---ver

Hold onto  faith as I dig another grave
LAm       MI5 FA              MI/SOL#  MI
Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel...
              
Real as ever
       MI5   RE5       FA5    MI5 LAm  SOL/SI DO   
And it seems I've been buried a--live

I walked the fields through the fire
       FA                  MI
Taking steps until I found solid ground
LAm              SOL/SI   DO
 Followed dreams reaching higher
            FA       MI
Couldn't survive the fall
LAm              SOL/SI    DO
Much has changed since the last time
      FA                 MI
And I feel a little less certain now
LAm                SOL/SI DO
 You know I jumped at the first sign
        FA           MI
Tell me only if it's real
REm      DO      SOL
Memories seem to fade (On and on it goes)
REm     DO    SOL  MI
Wash my view away...

Real as ever

And I'm chained like a sla---ve

Trapped in the dark

Slammed all the locks

Death calls my name

 Take you down now

Burn it all out

Throw you all around
         SOL5    FA#5  FA5   MI5      
Get your fucking hands off me!

What's it feel like?

Took the wrong route

Watch it fall apart

Now you're knockin' at the wrong gate
MI7/SOL#
 For you to pay the toll
LAm
 A price for you alone
MI7/SOL#
 The only deal you'll find
LAm                       MI5
 I'll gladly take your soul

While it seems sick

Sober up quick psycho lunatic
             SOL5 FA#5     FA5  MI5
Crushing you with hands of fate

Shame to find out when it's too late
             
But you're all the same
                 SOL5 FA#5 FA5 MI7/SOL#
Trapped inside infer--no   a---waits
 
Evil thoughts can hide
LAm
 I'll help release the mind
MI7/SOL#
 I'll peel away the skin
LAm                     MI5      
 Release the dark within

This is   now  your life
       SOL5 FA#5 FA5 MI5
Strike you  from the light
