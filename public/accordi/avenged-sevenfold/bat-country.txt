RE5    LAb5      SOL5  FA5    RE5   LAb5    SOL5    FA5
Caught here in a fiery blaze, won't lose my will to stay
  RE5       LAb5     RE5                   
I tri-i-i-i-i-ied to drive all through the night,
                       LAb5         RE5
the heat stroke ridden weather, the barren empty sights
    LAb5 SOL5    REb5        
No oasis here to see, 
    RE5     MI5     FA5       MI5
the sand is singing deathless words to me

REm                      SOLm        FA         DO
Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone)
                       FA          DO    
Too many doses and I'm starting to get an attraction
REm                       SOLm     FA        DO
 My confidence is leaving me on my own (all alone)
                           FA           DO    
No one can save me and you know I don't want the attention

   RE5       LAb5 RE5           
As I-I-I-I-I-I adjust to my new sights 
                 LAb5        RE5            
the rarely tired lights will take me to new heights
                  LAb5        RE5       
My hand is on the trigger I'm ready to ignite
                   LAb5        RE5             
Tomorrow might not make it but everything's all right
RE5    LAb5    SOL5    REb5   
Mental fiction, follow me 
RE5     MI5       FA5     MI5
show me what it's like to be set free

REm                      SOLm        FA         DO
Can't you help me as I'm startin' to burn (all alone)
                       FA          DO

Soooo sorry you're not here 
MI7       LAm              LAm/SOL       FAadd9
I've been sane too long my vision's so unclear
REm SOL              DO MI7       LAm             
Now take a trip with me but don't be surprised 
     LAm/SOL                 FAadd9
when things aren't what they seem

Sometimes I don't know why we'd rather live than die,
                       LAb5    RE5
we look up towards the sky for answers to our lives
                  LAb5        RE5
We may get some solutions but most just pass us by,
                    LAb5         RE5
don't want your absolution cause I can't make it right

 gets rid of all the pain of being a man
