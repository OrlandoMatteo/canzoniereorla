Hide my face again, harbor in the shadows
                                  
Feel this weight of sin hammering away

Die, with the guilt of a thousand AWOL soldiers

Die, watch the scythe usher me astray
MIb
 I can't go on this way
SOLm
 Not as I am today
RE                      SOLm    FA/LA SIb
 The ugly side of me is strong
MIb
 Take aim, a loaded gun
SOLm
 Pull back on all who run
RE                           MIb

RE5
Lash your tongue of bane

Carry me to nowhere

Mental holocaust

Battle never ends

Lie! Mask the pain

Of a child who's forsaken

Lie! To myself

Praise the new regime
MIb
 I left me long ago
SOLm
 Reasons you'll never know
RE                          SOLm  FA/LA SIb
 No one to miss me when I'm gone
MIb
 With no more words to say
SOLm
 No argument to stay

SOLm
 No home to call my own

No finding someone new
MIb
 No one to break the fall
DO5
 No one to see me through
SOLm
 No name to carry on

No promise for today
MIb
 No one to hear the call
FA
 No tattered flag to raise

RE5
Walk the razor's edge

Cut into the madness

Question all you trust

Buy into the fear

I see the man ripping at my soul now

I, I know the man

I know him all too well
MIb
 There's nothing here for free
SOLm
 Lost who I want to be
RE                              SOLm  FA/LA SIb
 My serpent blood can strike so cold
MIb
 On any given day
SOLm
 I'll take it all away
RE                          MIb
