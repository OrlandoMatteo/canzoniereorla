So I arrived, naked and cold
           MI5
A welcomed change from the abeyance 
     RE#5
of a ghost town catacomb
MI5
 No need for counsel, 
   RE#5                        MI5
I appreciate the time I’m not alone
               RE#5
(Why don’t you get my lawyer on the phone?)
           MI5              RE#5
There were days these child eyes
          MI5                     RE#5
Would overlook the ugliness and fantasize
MI5                             RE#5
 I found my heart for the first time 

and I awakened in me
MI5                   RE#5
 I left myself to navigate… 
                 SI5
and oh I felt control
                DO5      SI5                 DO5
(It seems these sheep have quite an appetite)

Who is the crowd that peers through the cage,
   REm              SI7
As we perform here upon the stage?

As the boy became a man
          MI5
In came a calm sophistication 
      RE#5
I can hardly understand
MI5                     RE#5
 So lost in ego, didn’t notice 
                           MI5
when the time had slipped away
            RE#5
(Yeah, everybody’s got a sob story)
      MI5                RE#5
Jesus Christ was born to die
            MI5                        RE#5
Leave it to man to levitate his own to idolize
MI5                           RE#5
 We’re simply sociopaths with no communication baby
MI5                      RE#5
 I see your angle but we differ 
                   SI5
from our points of view
           DO5 SI5                         DO5
(So tell me,    what’s your cross to bear?)

Tell me a lie in a beautiful way
    REm                    SI7
I believe in answers, just not today

 Hope my wheels don’t abandon me now,
                          FA/LA
Seeing that I’m out here alone
                   RE/FA#    SOLm
I’m running out of fight
                                 MIb/SOL
And the wind speaks a comforting voice,
                  FA/LA
Guiding me to her arms
              RE/FA#
Mother, I’m alright
            SOLm   
It took the birth of sin to snake-rattle the mind
         MIb/SOL
Before a blow to the head by the gavel of time
   FA/LA
To wake up
        RE/FA#
Won’t you wake up?
             SOLm
When did the walking apes decide that nuclear war
        MIb/SOL
Was the only solution for them keeping the score?
     FA/LA
Just wake up
        RE/FA#   
Can’t you wake up?
