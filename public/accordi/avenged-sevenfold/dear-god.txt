FA        DO             REm               LAm
 A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
SIb              FA           DO        
Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find
FA         DO            REm               LAm
 While I recall all the words you spoke to me
      SIb                FA
Can't help but wish that I was there
     DO                        FA
Back where I'd love to be, oh yeah

     DO       REm          DO
Dear God, the only thing I ask of you
      SIb               FA
Is to hold her when I'm not around
         DO                   FA
When I'm much too far away
       DO        REm             DO             
We all need that person who can be true to you
      SIb            FA
But I left her when I found her
    DO
And now I wish I'd stayed
           SIb            DO
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
    LA7          REm   DO SIb
I'm missing you again, oh no...
      FA
Once again

                DO           REm            LAm   
There's nothing here for me, on this barren road
        SIb                   FA
There's no one here while the city sleeps
DO                             FA
And all the shops are closed
               DO           REm                 LAm
Can't help but think of the times I've had with you
SIb               FA            DO
Pictures and some memories will have to help me through, 
      FA
oh yeah

I'm missing you again, oh no...

Once again

REm   LA/DO# SIb              FA
 Some search, never finding a way
REm     LA/DO# SIb           FA
 Before long,    they waste away
REm      LA/DO#  SIb
 I found you, 
                     FA   DO/MI
something told me to stay
REm     LA/DO# SIb         FA   DO/MI
 I gave in,     to selfish ways
SOLm7                      DO
 And how I miss someone to hold
                    FA
When hope begins to fade...
         DO             REm               LAm
A lonely road, crossed another cold state line
