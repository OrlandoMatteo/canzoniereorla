I feel insane every single time

I'm asked to compromise
                        
'Cause I'm afraid and stuck in my ways
                       
And that's the way it stays
                    
So how long did I expect

Love to outweigh ignorance?

By that look on your face

I may have forced the scale to tip

DO#m     SI          LA     MI SOL#7/DO
 I'm not insane, I'm not insane
DO#m       SI        LA   MI    SOL#7/DO#
 I'm not insane, I'm not, not insane

Come back to me, it's almost easy
        DO#m
(Set it off)

Come back again, it's almost easy

Shame pulses through my heart

From the things I've done to you

It's hard to face but the fact remains

That this is nothing new

I left you bound and tied

With suicidal memories

Selfish beneath the skin

But deep inside I'm not insane

DO#m     SI          LA     MI SOL#7/DO
 I'm not insane, I'm not insane
DO#m       SI        LA   MI    SOL#7/DO#
 I'm not insane, I'm not, not insane
 MI

Come back to me, it's almost easy
        DO#m
(Set it off)

Come back again, it's almost easy
                  MI
(You learned your lesson)

Come back to me, it's almost easy
                 DO#m
(It's still your fault)

Come back again, it's almost easy

Now that I've lost you, it kills me to say
 
(Hurts to say)
     SI                         SOL#            LA
I've tried to hold on as you've slowly slipped away

I'm losing the fight, I've treated you so wrong
    SOL#           LA
Now let me make it right
