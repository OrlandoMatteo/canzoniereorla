Nightmare!

(Now your nightmare comes to life)

FA      REm
 Dragged ya down below
FA    REm
 Down to the devil's show
FA     REm
 To be his guest forever

(Peace of mind is less than never)
FA       REm
 Hate to twist your mind
FA       REm
 But God ain't on your side
FA      REm
 An old acquaintance severed

(Burn the world your last endeavor)
FA       REm
  Flesh is burning

You can smell it in the air

'Cause men like you have

Such an easy soul to steal (steal)
FA        REm
  So stand in line while

They ink numbers in your head

You're now a slave

Until the end of time here

Nothing stops the madness,

Turning, haunting, yearning

Pull the trigger

FA        REm
 Can't wake up in sweat
FA        REm
'Cause it ain't over yet
FA        REm
 Still dancing with your demons

(Victim of your own creation)
FA     REm
 Beyond the will to fight
FA     REm
 Where all that's wrong is right
FA       REm
 Where hate don't need a reason

(Loathing self-assassination)
FA       REm
 You've been lied to

Just to rape you of your sight

And now they have the nerve

To tell you how to feel (feel)
FA     REm
 So sedated as they

Medicate your brain

And while you slowly

Go insane they tell ya

"Given with the best intentions

Help you with your complications"

REm              DO

 No one to call
FA            SIb
 Everybody to fear
REm          DO              FA        SIb   LA

SIb                         DO
  And I know you hear their voices
              SIb
Calling from above
                         DO
And I know they may seem real
                 SIb
These signals of love
                          DO
But our life's made up of choices
               SIb
Some without appeal
              SIm7/5-      DO             
They took for granted your soul
         DO#dim      REm
And it's ours now to steal

(As your nightmare comes to life)
