 I must have dreamed a thousand dreams,
                                 REb
been hunted by a million screams
               SI               LAb MIbm
I can hear the marching feet,
                                
they're moving into the street
                                  SOLb LAb
Now did you read the news today?
                                REb
They say the danger's gone away
                  SI                    LAb MIbm
But I can see the fire's still alight
                        
burning into the night

        REb      MIbm          LAb      
There's too many men, too many people
       SOLb     MIbm      SOLb
making too many problems,
    REb                  MIbm    SOLb
and not much love to go around
REb                      SOLb       MIbm     SOLb REb
Can't you see, this is a land of confusion?

MIbm SI          REb      SIbm    MIbm
  So this is the world we live in,
    SI            REb         SIbm   MIbm
and these are the hands we're given
SI           REb         SIbm    MIbm
Use them and let's start trying
   SI        REb         SIbm   LAb   LAbm
to make it a place worth living in

MIbm                              SOLb LAb
 Oh superman, where are you now,
                                      REb
when everything's gone wrong somehow?
                SI        LAb    MIbm
The man of steel, men of power
                                
are losing control by the hour

REb         MIbm  SOLb        LAb
This is the time, this is the place
      REb          MIbm   SOLb 
So we look for the future
            REb                  MIbm   REb       
But there's not much love to go around
        LAb           REb        MIbm     SOLb REb
Tell me why this is a land of confusion?

I remember long ago when the sun was shining,
    FAm7/DO                        
the stars were bright all through the night,
        MIb           SIb/RE    DOm
and the sound of your laughter
     FA       LAb             SI       
as I held you tight, so long ago

 I won't be coming home tonight
                                REb
My generation will put it right

We're not just making promises
                              
that we know we'll never keep
