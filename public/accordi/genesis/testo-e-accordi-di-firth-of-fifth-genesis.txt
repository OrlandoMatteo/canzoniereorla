 The path is clear
          MI/SOL#   SI/FA#
Though no eyes can see
     SOL6           FA#7/4    SI7/4   
The course laid down long  before
MI/SI          FA#m7/MI
 And so with gods and men
     SIm/RE        DO/RE
The sheep remain inside their pen,
       SOL                MI/SOL#          LA#dim  SI
Though many times they've seen the way to leave
            LA6/9
He rides majestic
     MI/SOL#   SI/FA#
Past homes of men
    SOL6        FA#7/4     SI7/4
Who care not or gaze with joy,
MI/SI       FA#m7/MI  
 To see reflected there
    SIm/RE              DO/RE
The trees, the sky, the lily fair,
    SOL               MI/SOL#      LA#dim
The scene of death is lying just below

 
    MI        LA6          MI7+      LA
The mountains cuts off the town from view,
       SIbm     MIbm      SIb7     MIb
Like a cancer growth is removed by skill
       MIb/FA FA/MIb SOL
Let it be     re   vealed
SIb6/DO          DOm7/FA
A waterfall, his madrigal
   MI6/+           SI
An inland sea, his symphony

 MI6/7+  SI  DO#m7/FA# 

 
SI       LA6/9
 Undinal songs
         MI/SOL# SI/FA#
Urge the sailors on
     SOL6     LA4 LA  RE6   MIm7/LA  SI  MI6/9  
Till lured by sirens' cry

 Now as the river dissolves in sea,
   SOL6        FA#7/4          SI7/4  MI/SI
So Neptune has claimed another soul
            FA#m7/MI
And so with gods and men
    SIm/RE         DO/RE
The sheep remain inside their pen,
  SOL              MI/SOL#          LA#dim  SI
Until the Shepherd leads his flock away
             LA6/9      MI/SOL# SI/FA#
The sands of time were eroded  by
    SOL6     FA#7/4    SI7/4
The river of constant change
