REm             SIb      LAm7            FA
 Well I've been waiting, waiting here so long
REm           SIb      LAm7             DO    
 But thinking nothing, nothing could go wrong, 
    SOL
ooh now I know
          SIb            FA
She has a built in ability
   SIb                 FA
To take everything she sees
SIb                            SIb/DO
 And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her

FA4                FA   SIb/FA        DO
 She seems to have an invisible touch yeah
FA4            FA    SIb/RE      DO
 She reaches in, and grabs right hold of your heart

Well I don't really know her, I only know her name
REm             SIb
 But she crawls under your skin, 
LAm7                    FA        SOL
 you're never quite the same, and now I know

She's got something you just can't trust
     SIb             FA    SIb
It's something mysterious
                              SIb/DO
And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her

She don't like losing, to her it's still a game
REm                  SIb
 And though she will mess up your life,
LAm7                       DO       SOL
 You'll want her just the same, and now I know
