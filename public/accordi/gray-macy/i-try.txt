When will they go from here

When will they stop?

I believe that fate has brought us here

And we should be together, babe

But we're not

I try to say goodbye and I choke

Try to walk away and I stumble

My world crumbles when you are not near

 I may appear to be free

But I'm just a prisoner of your love

And I may seem alright and smile when you leave

But my smiles are just a front

Just a front, hey

 Here is my confession
                FA7+
May I be your possession?
                 MIm7
Boy, I need your touch

Your love, kisses, and such
