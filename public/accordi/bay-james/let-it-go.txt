REb SOLb7+  SIbm LAb

REb               SOLb7+            SIbm  LAb6
 From walking home and talking loads
REb             SOLb7+                    SIbm  LAb6
 To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
REb                SOLb7+             SIbm  LAb6
 From nervous touch and getting drunk
REb           SOLb7+               SIbm   LAb
 To staying up and waking up with you
              SIbm               REb/LAb
But now we're sleeping at the edge
                           SOLm7/5-  SOLb7+  
Holding something we don't need
           SIbm               REb/LAb
All this delusion in our heads
                         SOLm7/5-
Is gonna bring us to our knees

                   SOLb7+ REb
So come on, let it go
            SIbm  LAb
Just let it be
                 MIbm7  REb
Why don't you be you
             LAb6
And I'll be me?
                  SOLb7+  REb
Everything that's broke
                SIbm   LAb6
Leave it to the breeze
                 MIbm7  REb
Why don't you be you
            LAb6
And I'll be me?
            REb SOLb7+  SIbm LAb
And I'll be me

REb SOLb7+  SIbm LAb

REb                  SOLb7+            SIbm  LAb6
 From throwing clothes across the floor
REb                SOLb7+                  SIbm  LAb6
 To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
REb            SOLb7+           SIbm  LAb6
 If this is all we're living for
           REb                 SOLb7+         SIbm  LAb6
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore?
          SIbm           REb/LAb 
I used to recognize myself
                           SOLm7/5-  SOLb7+
It's funny how reflections change
             SIbm                REb/LAb
When we're becoming something else
                           SOLm7/5-
I think it's time to walk away

                   SOLb7+ REb
So come on, let it go
            SIbm  LAb
Just let it be
                 MIbm7  REb
Why don't you be you
             LAb6
And I'll be me?
                  SOLb7+  REb
Everything that's broke
                SIbm   LAb6
Leave it to the breeze
                 MIbm7  REb
Why don't you be you
            LAb
And I'll be me?
            REb SOLb7+  SIbm LAb
And I'll be me

REb SOLb7+  SIbm LAb

MIbm7                               REb
 Trying to fit your hand inside of mine

When we know it just don't belong
LAb
 There's no force on earth
                    SIbm
Could make it feel right, no
      MIbm7
Whoa
                                   REb
Trying to push this problem up the hill

When it's just too heavy to hold
LAb                              SIbm
  Think now's the time to let it slide

                   SOLb7+ REb
So come on, let it go
            SIbm  LAb6
Just let it be
                 MIbm7  REb
Why don't you be you
            LAb6
And I'll be me?
                  SOLb7+  REb
Everything that's broke
                SIbm   LAb6
Leave it to the breeze
                 MIbm7  REb
Why don't you be you
            LAb6
And I'll be me?
                   SOLb7+ REb
So come on, let it go
            SIbm  LAb6
Just let it be
                 MIbm7  REb
Why don't you be you
            LAb6
And I'll be me?
            REb SOLb7+  SIbm LAb
And I'll be me

REb SOLb7+  SIbm LAb  REb
