DOm         
Written in these walls are the stories 
                MIb
that I can't explain
  DOm
I leave my heart open 
                                  MIb
but it stays right here empty for days
    DOm
She told me in the morning
          LAb                           MIb
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
   DOm
It seems to me that when I die
      LAb                         MIb
These words will be written on my stone
            LAb   SIb    DOm
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
                      LAb     SIb  DOm
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
                    LAb     SIb    DOm
The way that I been holdin' on too tight
                   SIb
With nothing in between

    MIb
The story of my life, I take her home
  LAb                                  DOm7
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
   LAb MIb
Is fro-zen (the story of, the story of, the story of)
    
The story of my life, I give her hope
  LAb                                DOm7   LAb
I spend her love until she's broke inside
               MIb
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)

DOm     
Written on these walls are
                         MIb
The colors that I can't change
DOm
Leave my heart open
                               MIb
But it stays right here in its cage
  DOm      
I know that in the morning now
  LAb                        MIb
I see us in the light upon a hill
  DOm                    LAb             MIb
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed, still
            LAb   SIb    DOm
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
                    LAb     SIb     DOm
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
                       LAb     SIb   DOm
The way that I've been holdin' on so tight
                   SIb
With nothing in between

    MIb
The story of my life, I take her home

               MIb
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
              FAm7                           SIb
And I've been waiting for this time to come around
           FAm7                                  SIb
But, baby, running after you is like chasing the clouds

    MIb
The story of my life

I take her home
  LAb
I drive all night
                     DOm

Is frozen
