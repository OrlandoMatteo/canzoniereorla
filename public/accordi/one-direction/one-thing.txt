I've tried playin' it cool
             LA         SOL
But when I'm lookin' at you
        LA      SIm7
I can't ever be brave
       SOL         LA    RE
'Cause you make my heart race
        LA         RE
Shot me out of the sky
          LA    SOL
You're my kryptonite

You keep making me weak
      SOL         LA    RE
Yeah, frozen, and can't breathe

And fall into my arms in-stead
         SOL            LA           SIm
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
