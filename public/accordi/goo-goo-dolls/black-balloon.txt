Baby's black balloon makes her fly
                        SOLbadd9
I almost fell into that hole in your life
REb                              SOLbadd9
 And you're not thinking 'bout tomorrow
    SIbm7        LAb/DO  REb

 How could I have been the one?
REb                     SOLbadd9
 I saw the world spin beneath you
    SIbm7        LAb/DO       REb             
And scatter like ice from the spoon 
              LAb4  SOLb

    SIbm7  LAb     SOLb     REb
And angels fall without you there
    SIbm7 LAb   SOLb    REb
And I go  on as you get colder

Or are you someone's prayer?

REb                            SOLbadd9
 You know the lies they always told you
REb                     SOLbadd9
 And the love you never knew
REb                           SOLbadd9
 What's the things they never showed you
     SIbm7       LAb/DO         REb
