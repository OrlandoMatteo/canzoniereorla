And you asked me what I want this year
       SOLadd9
And I try to make this kind and clear
        LA                                  RE
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days

'Cause I don't need boxes wrapped in strings
       SOLadd9
And designer love and empty things
        LA                SOLadd9           RE    
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days
   SOLadd9              LA4
So take these words and sing out loud
       SOLadd9        LA4
'Cause everyone is forgiven now
         SIm7                  SOLadd9       RE
'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again

       RE
I need some place simple where we could live
     SOLadd9
And something only you can give
            LA
And that's faith and trust 
     SOLadd9           RE
and peace while we're alive
        
And the one poor child who saved this world
             SOLadd9
And there's ten million more who probably could
       LA
If we all just stopped 
    SOLadd9           RE
and said a prayer for them
   SOLadd9              LA4
So take these words and sing out loud
       SOLadd9        LA4
'Cause everyone is forgiven now
         SIm7                  SOLadd9       RE
'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again

SOLadd9    SIm7  SOLadd9  RE

       RE
I wish everyone was loved tonight
     SOLadd9
And somehow stop this endless fight
        LA                SOLadd9           RE
Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days
   SOLadd9              LA4
So take these words and sing out loud
       SOLadd9        LA4
'Cause everyone is forgiven now
         SIm7                  SOLadd9       RE
'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again
         SIm7                  SOLadd9       RE
'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again
