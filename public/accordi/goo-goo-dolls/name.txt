LA  LA/SOL#  REadd9  

FA#m7 MI REadd9

    LA              LA/SOL#          REadd9
And even though the moment passed me by
  FA#m7       MI    REadd9
I still can't turn away
    LA                 LA/SOL#             REadd9                
Cuz all the dreams you never thought you'd lose
    FA#m7   MI       REadd9
Got tossed along the way
    LA               LA/SOL#        REadd9
And letters that you never meant to send
    FA#m7   MI      REadd9
Got lost or thrown away

    FA#m7              MI   
And now we're grown up orphans
    REadd9
And never knew their names
   FA#m7              MI
We don't belong to no one
           REadd9
That's a shame
    FA#m7            MI
But you could hide beside me
REadd9
Maybe for a while
    FA#m7        MI       REadd9
And I won't tell no one your name
                          LA  LA/SOL#  REadd9
And I won't tell 'em your name

FA#m7 MI REadd9

    LA             LA/SOL#          REadd9
And scars are souvenirs you never lose
    FA#m7   MI    REadd9
The past is never far
LA               LA/SOL#            REadd9
Did you lose yourself somewhere out there?
        FA#m7  MI   REadd9
Did you get to be a star?
    LA                LA/SOL#          REadd9
And don't it make you sad to know that life
   FA#m7     MI     REadd9
Is more than who we are

   FA#m7           MI
We grew up way too fast
                REadd9
And now there's nothing to believe
    FA#m7        MI             REadd9
And reruns all become our history
  FA#m7            MI           REadd9
A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio
    FA#m7        MI          REadd9
And I won't tell no one your name
                          LA  LA/SOL#  REadd9
And I won't tell 'em your name
FA#m7   MI            REadd9
I won't tell em' your name
LA  LA/SOL#  REadd9
Oooh...
FA#m7   MI            REadd9
I won't tell em' your name

   FA#m7  MI  REadd9     FA#m7  MI  REadd9
Ow!

FA#m7  MI  REadd9     FA#m7  MI  REadd9

LA        LA/SOL#          REadd9
 I think about you all the time
    FA#m7   MI       REadd9
But I don't need the same
     LA               LA/SOL#
It's lonely where you are
          REadd9
Come back down
    FA#m7   MI            REadd9   LA
And I won't tell 'em your name
