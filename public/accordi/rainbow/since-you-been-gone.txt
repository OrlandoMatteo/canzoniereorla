SOL        RE/FA#
 I get the same old dreams, 
MIm        SOL/RE
 same time every night
DO           SOL/SI       LA7    RE
 Fall to the ground and I wake up
SOL       RE/FA#          MIm
 So I get out of bed, put on my shoes, 
    SOL/RE
and in my head
DO            SOL/SI      LA7     RE
 Thoughts fly back to the break-up
MIb                   FA
 These four walls are closing in
MIb                     FA/LA  RE
 Look at the fix you've put me in

SOL               RE MIm               DO
Since you been gone, since you been gone
    SOL            RE    MIm  DO   RE
I'm outta my head, can't take it
SOL             RE    MIm               DO
Could I be wrong, but since you been gone
SOL               RE MIm   DO   RE
You cast a spell, so break it
SOL   RE MIm   DO  SOL   RE MIm DO
Oooohhh...
          RE
Since you been gone

SOL        RE/FA#       MIm
 So in the night I stand beneath 
    SOL/RE
the back street light
DO         SOL/SI          LA7       RE
 I read the words that you sent to me
SOL             RE/FA#
 I can take the afternoon, 
    MIm               SOL/RE
the night-time comes around too soon
DO         SOL/SI        LA7      RE
 You can't know what you mean to me
MIb                       FA
 Your poison letter, your telegram
MIb                          FA/LA  RE
 Just goes to show you don't give a damn

SOL               RE MIm               DO
Since you been gone, since you been gone
    SOL            RE    MIm  DO   RE
I'm outta my head, can't take it
SOL             RE    MIm               DO
Could I be wrong, but since you been gone
SOL               RE MIm   DO   RE
You cast a spell, so break it
SOL   RE MIm   DO  SOL   RE MIm DO
