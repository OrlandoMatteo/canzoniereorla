SOL    SIm  

          SOL
I didn't hear you leave
                        SIm
I wonder how am I still here
                    SOL
And I don't want to move a thing
                 SIm
It might change my memory
     MIm7/9
Oh I am what I am

I'll do what I want
    FA#m7/9
But I can't hide

        SOL
I won't go
        SOL7+
I won't sleep
        RE
I can't breathe
             RE7+
Until you're resting here with me
 SIm
I won't leave I can't hide
         LA4
I cannot be
             LA    
Until you're resting here with me

SOL   SIm 

                SOL 
I don't want to call my friends
                             SIm
They might wake me from this dream
            SOL
And I can't leave this bed
                           SIm
Risk forgetting all that's been
