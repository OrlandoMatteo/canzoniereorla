 Two weeks away it feels 

like the whole world should've changed
        SIadd9
But I'm home now
           
And things still look the same
MIadd9
 I think I'll leave it till tomorrow to unpack
          SIadd9
Try to forget for one more night
                                MIadd9
That I'm back in my flat on the road

Where the cars never stop going through the night
     SIadd9
To a life where I can't watch the sunset
             DO#m7
I don't have time
             SOL#m  FA#
I don't have time

DO#m7                      SI
 I've still got sand in my shoes
            FA#
And I can't shake the thought of you
DO#m7                     SI
 I should get on, forget you
              FA#      DO#m7
But why would I want to
                
I know we said goodbye
SI                     FA#
Anything else would've been confused 
    MIadd9  SI              FA#
but I        wanna see you again

MIadd9
 Tomorrow's back to work and down to sanitation
      SIadd9
Run a bath and then clear up the mess I made 

before I left here
MIadd9
 Try to remind myself that I was happy here
         SIadd9
Before I knew that I could get 

on the plane and fly away
         MIadd9
From the road where the cars 

never stop going through the night
     SIadd9
To a life where I can watch the sunset
            DO#m7
And take my time
             SOL#m  FA#
Take all our time

DO#m7                      SI
 I've still got sand in my shoes
            FA#
And I can't shake the thought of you
DO#m7                     SI
 I should get on, forget you
              FA#      DO#m7
But why would I want to
                
I know we said goodbye
SI                     FA#
Anything else would've been confused 
    MIadd9  SI              FA#
but I        wanna see you again
MIadd9  SI              FA#
I        wanna see you again....

                           SI/DO# 
Two weeks away, all it takes to change 
             FA#/DO#
and turn me around I've fallen
DO#m
 I walked away and never said 
     SOL#m/DO#   FA#/DO       
that I wanted to see you again

DO#m7                      SI
 I've still got sand in my shoes
            FA#
And I can't shake the thought of you
DO#m7                     SI
 I should get on, forget you
              FA#      DO#m7
But why would I want to
                
I know we said goodbye
SI                     FA#
Anything else would've been confused 
    MIadd9  SI              FA#
but I        wanna see you again
MIadd9  SI              FA#
I        wanna see you again....
MIadd9  SI              FA#
I        wanna see you again
