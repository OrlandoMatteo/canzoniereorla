LAm

 
I wanna go to bed
           LAm        MIm
With arms around me
                  REm
But wake up on my own
                       LAm      MIm
Pretend that I'm still sleeping
             REm
Until you go home
                             LAm
Oh, I can't look at you This morning
MIm                       REm
 I should probably have a sign
LAm                           MIm7
 That says leave right now or quicker
                       REm
You've overstayed your time

     REm7             MIm7
If I don't believe in love
             LAm
Nothing will last for me
     REm7/9           MIm7
If I don't believe in love
           LAm
Nothing is safe for me
       REm7             MIm7
When I don't believe in love
           LAm
You're too close to me
                   REm7/9        MIm7  LAm
And that's why you have to leave

 
Maybe I slept peaceful
        LAm9       MIm
On your shoulder
                        REm
Your arm warm around my side
                               LAm9   MIm
But it's different now It's morning
                      REm
And I can't face your smile
                    LAm
The second that I feel
                MIm
Your safe hands
                 REm    REm7/4  LAm9
Reaching out for mine
                MIm7
I slip away and out of sight
                        REm7
You've over stayed your time

     REm7/9           MIm7
If I don't believe in love
           LAm
Nothing is good for me
     REm7/9           MIm7      
If I don't believe in love
             LAm
Nothing will last for me
     REm7/9           MIm7
If I don't believe in love
           LAm
Nothing is new for me
           REm7/9      MIm7
Nothing is warm for me
               LAm
And nothing is real for me

Nothing is new for me

               LAm
And nothing is real for me
     REm7/9           MIm7
If I don't believe in love
           LAm
Why do you care for me?
       REm7/9           MIm7
When I don't believe in love
           LAm
Nothing is real for me
     REm7/9           MIm7
If I don't believe in love
                   LAm
You're getting too close to me
                   REm7/9        MIm7
And that's why you have to leave
                   LAm
And that's why you have to leave

If I don't believe in love
     REm7/9           MIm7
If I don't believe in love
           LAm
Nothing is left for me
     REm7/9           MIm7
If I don't believe in love
           LAm
You're too good for me
