 Like a ghost don't need a key,
         SI/FA#               FA#   
Your best friend I've come to be
SI/FA#                         FA#
 Please don't think of getting up for me
          SI/FA#       FA#
You don't even need to speak
SI/FA#                            FA#
 When I've been here for just one day
            SI/FA#           FA#
You already miss me if I go away
SI/FA#                            FA#
 So close the blinds and shut the door
               SI/FA#            FA#
You won't need other friends anymore
SI DO#          FA#
Oh, don't leave home
SI DO#          SOL#m

If you're alone, just hold on

'Cause I will be your safe-ty
FA#         DO#
Oh, don't leave home

SI/FA#                   FA#
 I arrived when you were weak
              SI/FA#        FA#
I'll make you weaker like a child
SI/FA#                         FA#
 Now all your love you give to me
          SI/FA#            FA#
When your heart is all I'll need

RE#m    DO#              SI7+
 Oh how quiet, quiet the world can be
RE#m       DO#          SOL#m7
 When it's just you and little me
RE#m           DO#             SI7+
 Everything is clear and everything is new
