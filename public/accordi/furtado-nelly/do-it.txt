You're standing at the door
   SOLb
I'm falling to the floor
    SIbm      LAb       SOLb
You look even better than you did before
    SIbm          REb
I'm staring at my feet
 SOLb 
Wondering if I can do this
     MIbm    FAm       SOLb   
It's been a while but I couldn't forget you
SIbm               REb        
Just a little look has got me feeling things
SOLb
Just a little taste has got me seeing things
MIbm7                   FAm7
Just a little touch has got me off the chains
SOLb7+      
Doing things that I don't want to

SIbm           REb      SOLb7+
Do it like you do it to me (I'm burning up)
SIbm           LAb      SOLb7+
Do it like you do it to me (it's not enough)
SIbm           REb      SOLb7+
Do it like you do it to me (just open up)
          MIbm7  FAm7 SOLb7+
Don't you know  how  much I want you

      SIbm         REb
We're sitting real close 
     SOLb7+
and I can feel your breath
  SIbm             LAb    SOLb7+
I wanna touch your hand but I lay back
       SIbm          REb
'cause you know this thing 
     SOLb7+
could spiral in the night
     MIbm7    FAm7       SOLb7+
I've changed my mind I'm ready
