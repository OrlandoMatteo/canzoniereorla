In the day
       MIb
In the night
       REb
Say it right
        SIbm
Say it all
           FAm
You either got it
       MIb
Or you don't
           REb           SIbm
You either stand or you fall
          FAm     MIb
When your will is broken
        REb             SIbm
When it slips from your hand
             FAm         MIb
When there's no time for joking
          REb         SIbm
There's a hole in the plan

   FAm             MIb              REb  SIbm
Oh you don't mean nothing at all to me
   FAm             MIb              REb  SIbm
No you don't mean nothing at all to me
    FAm             MIb             REb   SIbm
But you got what it takes to set me free
   FAm             MIb          REb  SIbm
Oh you could mean everything to me

        FAm          MIb  REb        SIbm
I can't say that I'm not lost and at fault
        FAm        MIb            REb           SIbm
I can't say that I don't love the light and the dark
        FAm        MIb             REb    SIbm
I can't say that I don't know that I am alive
        FAm       MIb          REb
And all of what I feel I could show
       SIbm
You tonight you tonight

   FAm             MIb              REb  SIbm
Oh you don't mean nothing at all to me
   FAm             MIb              REb  SIbm
No you don't mean nothing at all to me
    FAm             MIb             REb   SIbm
But you got what it takes to set me free
   FAm             MIb          REb  SIbm
Oh you could mean everything to me

        FAm            MIb
From my hands I could give you
REb               SIbm
Something that I made
        FAm             MIb
From my mouth I could sing you
         REb           SIbm
Another brick that I laid
        FAm            MIb
From my body I could show you
  REb       SIbm
A place God knows
           FAm               MIb
You should know the space is holy
       REb          SIbm   FAm7  MIb  REb  SIbm
Do you really wanna go?
