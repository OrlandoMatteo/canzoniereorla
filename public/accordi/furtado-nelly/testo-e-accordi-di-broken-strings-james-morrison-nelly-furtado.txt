Let me hold you For the last time
                              SOLbadd9
It's the last chance to feel again
        SIbm7
But you broke me
                    SOLbadd9  MIbm7
Now I can't feel anything
       SIbm7
When I love you It's so untrue
   SOLbadd9
I can't even convince myself
          SIbm7
When I'm speaking
         REb              SOLb  MIbm7
It's the voice of someone else
      SOLb  LAb SIbm
Oh it tears me  up
   SOLb         LAb       FAm
I tried to hold on but it hurts too much
   SOLb        LAb           FAm
I tried to forgive but it's not enough
   SOLb
To make it all okay

REb/FA     MIbm            SIbm
 You can't play on broken strings
          REb     LAb
You can't feel anything
          MIbm                SIbm
That your heart don't want to feel
        REb                           LAb
I can't tell you something that ain’t real
       SOLb             SIbm
Oh the truth hurts And life’s worse
REb                LAb
I can't like it anymore
       MIbm              SIbm        LAb
When I love you a little less than before

        SIbm
Oh what are we doing
       SOLb
We are turning into dust
         SIbm
Playing house in the ruins
    SOLb  MIbm7
of.. us
         SIbm                
Running back through the fire
              SOLb
When there's nothing left to say
           SIbm
It's like chasing
          REb                    SOLb
the very last train when it's too late
     MIbm7      
too late 
      SOLb  LAb SIbm
Oh it tears me  up
   SOLb         LAb       FAm
I tried to hold on but it hurts too much

         REb                FAm7
When we both know it's too late  too late
