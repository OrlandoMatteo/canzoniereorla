LAm FA/LA SOL4 SOL   LAm FA/LA SOL

             LAm      FA6/LA    SOL
I'll sing it one last time for you
        LAm    FA6/LA    SOL
Then we really have to go
                LAm  FA6/LA        SOL
You've been the only thing that's right
            LAm  FA6/LA  SOL
In all I've done
          LAm    FA6/LA   SOL
And I can barely look at you
          LAm    FA6/LA   SOL
But every single time I do
             LAm     FA6/LA SOL
I know we'll make it anywhere
         LAm    FA6/LA SOL
Away from here

DO
 Light up, light up
          SOL
As if you have a choice
                   LAm7
Even if you cannot hear my voice
                          FAadd9
I'll be right beside you dear
DO
 Louder louder
              SOL
And we'll run for our lives
                      LAm7
I can hardly speak I understand
                                   FAadd9
Why you can't raise your voice to say
       
LAm  FA6/LA  SOL

           LAm       FA6/LA     SOL
To think I might not see those eyes
         LAm     FA6/LA   SOL
Makes it so hard not to cry
          LAm     FA6/LA    SOL
And as we say our long goodbye
        LAm  FA6/LA  SOL
I nearly do

DO
 Light up, light up
          SOL
As if you have a choice
                   LAm7
Even if you cannot hear my voice
                          FAadd9
I'll be right beside you dear
DO
 Have heart, my dear
               SOL
We're bound to be afraid
                       LAm7
Even if it's just for a few days
                       FAadd9
Making up for all this mess

DO   SOL   LAm7   FAadd9

DO
 Light up, light up
           SOL
As if you have a choice
                   LAm
Even if you cannot hear my voice
                           FA    DO
I'll be right beside you dear
