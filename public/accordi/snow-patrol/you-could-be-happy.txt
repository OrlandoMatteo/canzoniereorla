You could be happy and I won't know
                          FA    DO6          SIb7+
But you weren't happy the day I watched you go
                          FA      DO6       SIb7+
And all the things that I wished I had not said
                               FA      DO6    SIb7+
Are played in loops 'till it's madness in my head
                    SOLm7/9  LAm7   SIb
Is it too late to remind you how we were
                         SOLm7/9  LAm7       SIb
But not our last days of silence, screaming, blur
                 SOLm7/9 LAm7     SIb
Most of what I remember makes me sure
                               SOLm7/9 LAm7    SIb
I should have stopped you from walking out the door

             FA        DO6      SIb7+
You could be happy, I hope you are
                    FA       DO6      SIb7+
You made me happier than I'd been by far
                    FA    DO6       SIb7+
Somehow everything I own smells of you
                    FA          DO6      SIb7+
And for the tiniest moment it's all not true
                        SOLm7/9 LAm7  SIb
Do the things that you always wanted to
                          SOLm7/9        LAm7        SIb
Without me there to hold you back, don't think, just do
                     SOLm7/9  LAm7     SIb
More than anything I want to see you, girl
                 SOLm7/9        LAm7    SIb
Take a glorious bite out of the whole world
