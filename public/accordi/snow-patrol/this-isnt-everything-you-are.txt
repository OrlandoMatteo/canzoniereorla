FA#   SOL#m7/9   FA#/MI

          FA#
You can't find the phone
           SOL#m7/9
So you can call it off
             FA#/MI
But it might be for the best
          FA#           SOL#m7/9
You can't walk away, anyway
               FA#/MI
Because you've nowhere else to go
            FA#
Is he worth all this?
               SOL#m7/9
Is it a simple yes?
               FA#/MI
Because if you have to think, it's fucked
                  FA#
Feels like you've loved him more
        SOL#m7/9
Than he loved you
        FA#/MI
And you wish you'd never met
           FA#
Don't keel over now
           SOL#m7/9
Don't keel over
           FA#/MI
Don't keel over now

Don't keel over
            FA#
You've been up all night
         SOL#m7/9
And the night before
                FA#/MI
And you've lost counts of drinks and time
         FA#                        SOL#m7/9
And your friends keep calling, worried sick
            FA#/MI
And there's strangers everywhere
           FA#
Don't keel over now
           SOL#m7/9
Don't keel over
           FA#/MI
Don't keel over now

Don't keel over

SI
 And in one little moment
SOL#m7
 It all implodes
FA#                        MI
 This isn't everything you are
SI
 Breathe deeply in the silence
SOL#m7
 No sudden moves
FA#                        MI
 This isn't everything you are
SI
 Just take the hand that's offered
SOL#m7
 And hold on tight
FA#                        MI
 This isn't everything you are
SI
 There's joy not far from here
SOL#m7
 I know there is
FA#                        MI
 This isn't everything you are

FA#   SOL#m7/9   FA#/MI

         FA#
When you took the call
          SOL#m7/9
How could you know
          FA#/MI
That he'd slipped away last night
             FA#                SOL#m7/9
And you wish you went home days ago
              FA#/MI
To say goodbye, or just hello
           FA#
Don't keel over now
           SOL#m7/9
Don't keel over
           FA#/MI
Don't keel over now

Don't keel over

 And in one little moment

 And hold on tight
FA#                        MI
 This isn't everything you are
SI 
 There's joy not far from here, right
SOL#m7
 I know there is
FA#                        MIadd9
