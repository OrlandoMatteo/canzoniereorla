LA   FA#m   RE MI7 LA

         LA             FA#m
When the night has come
         
And the land is dark
        RE          MI7        LA
And the moon is the only light we'll see
                     
No I won't be afraid
    FA#m
No I won't be afraid
        RE          MI7          LA
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

                     LA
And darling, darling stand by me
           FA#m             RE
Oh, now, now, stand by me
           MI7        LA
Stand by me, stand by me

       LA                    FA#m
If the sky that we look upon
 
Should tumble and fall
        RE              MI7            LA
And the mountain should crumble to the sea

I won't cry, I won't cry
     FA#m
No I won't shed a tear
        RE          MI7          LA
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

                     LA
And darling, darling stand by me
   FA#m           RE
Oh,  stand by me
           MI7          LA
Stand by me, stand by me, stand by me

LA   FA#m   RE MI7 LA

LA   FA#m   RE MI7 LA

                                     LA
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me
            FA#m
Oh, now, now, stand by me
          RE       MI7         LA
Oh, stand by me, stand by me, stand by me
                              FA#m
Darling, darling stand by me

Stand by me
   RE           MI7          LA
Oh stand by me, stand by me, stand by me...
