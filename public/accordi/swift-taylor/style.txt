Midnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights
SIm                                        SOL7+
Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise
     SIm
Fade into view, oh,
                                    SOL7+
It's been a while since I have even heard from you

(Heard from you)
MIm7                                        FA#m7
 And I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
                                SOL7+
Know exactly where it leads but I

Watch it go round and round each time

             RE
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
    LA         SOLadd9
And I got that red lip, 

classic thing that you like
    LA         RE
And when we go crashing down, 

we come back every time
          LA       SOLadd9
'Cause we never go out of style, 
    
we never go out of style
       LA       RE
You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
    LA         SOLad9
And I got that good girl faith 

and a tight little skirt
    LA         SIm7
And when we go crashing down, 

we come back every time
          LA       SOLadd9
'Cause we never go out of style, 
                           LA
we never go out of style

SIm                                     SOL7+
So it goes, he can't keep his wild eyes on the road
SIm
Takes me home, lights are off 
            SOL7+
he's taking off his coat (Hm yeah)
       SIm
I say "I've heard that you've been out 
                    SOL7+
and about with some other girl, some other girl"
MIm7                                     FA#m7
 He says "What you've heard is true but I
                                    SOL7+
Can't stop thinking about you" and I

I said "I've been there too a few times"
