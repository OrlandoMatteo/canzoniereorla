DOadd9  SOL  RE  MIm7

DOadd9                   SOL
I remember when we broke up, the first time
RE                             MIm7
Saying, "this is it, I've had enough"
                DOadd9                      SOL
'Cause like, we hadn't seen each other in a month
         RE              MIm7
When you said you needed space (what?)
DOadd9                         SOL
Then you come around again and say
         RE
"Baby, I miss you 
                      MIm7
and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
  DOadd9                       SOL
Remember how that lasted for a day?
          RE
I say, "I hate you, 
                  MIm7
"we break up, you call me, "I love you"
DOadd9    SOL
Ooh, ooh, ooh...
   RE             MIm7
We called it off again last night
    DOadd9    SOL
But ooh, ooh, ooh...
RE             MIm7
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

DOadd9 SOL          RE          MIm7   RE
We are never ever, ever getting back together
DOadd9 SOL          RE          MIm7   RE

    DOadd9 SOL          RE

    RE    MIm7
Like, ever

    DOadd9                        SOL
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
       RE                                 MIm7
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
        DOadd9
And you would hide away 
                       SOL
and find your peace of mind
          RE
With some indie record 
            MIm7
that's much cooler than mine
DOadd9    SOL
Ooh, ooh, ooh...
    RE            MIm7
You called me up again tonight
    DOadd9    SOL
But ooh, ooh, ooh...
RE             MIm7
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

ever getting back together...

DOadd9  SOL  RE  MIm7 RE

DOadd9    SOL        RE        MIm7 
I used to think that we were forever ever, ever
    DOadd9    SOL   RE          MIm7  DOadd9
And I used to say, "never say never"

DOadd9  SOL  RE  MIm7  DOadd9  SOL  RE  MIm7

Parlato:
Ah, so he calls me up 
and he's like, "I still love you"
And I'm like, I'm just, 
I mean this is exhausting, you know?
Like we are never getting back together, 
like, ever
