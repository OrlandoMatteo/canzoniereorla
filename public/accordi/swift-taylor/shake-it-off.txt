REm            SIbadd9     
 I tried to be perfect
                FA
But nothing was worth it
          DO/MI             REm
I don’t believe it makes me real
                   SIbadd9
I thought it’d be easy
              FA
But no one believes me
        DO/MI            SIb
I meant all the things I said
                          FA
If you believe it’s in my soul
        DO/MI                SIb
I’d say all the words that I know
                        FA
Just to see if it would show
           DO/MI            SIb
That I’m trying to let you know
                          REm  SIbadd9  FA  DO/MI
That I’m better off on my own

REm               SIbadd9
 This place is so empty
                   FA
My thoughts are so tempting
             DO/MI         REm
I don’t know how it got so bad
                  SIbadd9
Sometimes it’s so crazy
                 FA
That nothing can save me
             DO/MI             SIb
But it’s the only thing that I have
                          FA
If you believe it’s in my soul
        DO/MI                SIb
I’d say all the words that I know
                        FA
Just to see if it would show
         DO/MI              SIb
That I’m trying to let you know
                          FA  SIb
That I’m better off on my own

FA  SIb

On my own

REm            SIbadd9
 I tried to be perfect
               FA
It just wasn’t worth it
              DO/MI      REm
Nothing could ever be so wrong
               SIbadd9
It’s hard to believe me
              FA
It never gets easy
          DO/MI          SIb
I guess I knew that all along
                          FA
If you believe it’s in my soul
        DO/MI                SIb
I’d say all the words that I know
                        FA
Just to see if it would show
         DO                SIb
That I’m trying to let you know
                          FA
That I’m better off on my own
