You're on the phone with your girlfriend
        DO#                                           SOL#m
She's upset, she's going off about something that you said
                                       SI
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
FA#                                     DO#
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
                                               SOL#m
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
                                      SI
And she'll never know your story like I do
    SOL#m7
But she wears short skirts
SI
I wear T-shirts
FA#
She's cheer captain
    DO#
And I'm on the bleachers
SOL#m7                          SI
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
                DO#
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

             FA#
If you could see

That I'm the one

Who understands you
DO#
Been here all along
                  SOL#m7
So, why can't you see
                SI
You belong with me,

You belong with me

FA#                                            DO#
Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
                                               SOL#m
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
                                        SI
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself,

"Hey, isn't this easy?"
    FA#
And you've got a smile
                                DO#
That could light up this whole town
                       
I haven't seen it in a while
                       SOL#m
Since she brought you down

You say you're fine I know you better than that
    SI
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?
SOL#m7
She wears high heels,
SI
I wear sneakers
FA# 
She's cheer captain,
    DO#
And I'm on the bleachers
SOL#m7                          SI

FA#
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
DO#                                     SOL#m7

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
       SI
In the middle of the night
        FA#
I'm the one who makes you laugh
         DO#
When you know you're 'bout to cry
  SOL#m7
I know your favorite songs,
        SI
And you tell me about your dreams
        FA#
Think I know where you belong,
        DO#
Think I know it's with me
