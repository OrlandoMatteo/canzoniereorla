LAm   SOL FA

LAm                              SOL
 I don't want you to give it all up
                   FA              LAm
And leave your own life collecting dust
                                       SOL
And I don't want you to feel sorry for me
               FA7+           LAm
You never gave us a chance to be
                                 SOL
And I don't need you to be by my side
                FA             LAm
To tell me that everything's alright
                                 SOL
I just wanted you to tell me the truth
                FA            LAm  SI5
You know I'd do that for you

   DO          RE5      FA7+  DO SOL LAm MIm
So why are you running away?
DO          RE5      FA7+   DO SOL LAm
Why are you running away?

LAm                                  SOL
 Cause I did enough to show you that I
               FA            LAm
Was willing to give and sacrifice
                                      SOL
And I was the one who was lifting you up
                      FA            LAm
When you thought your life had had enough
                                SOL
And when I get close, you turn away
                     FA          LAm
There's nothing that I can do or say
                                 SOL
So now I need you to tell me the truth
                FA           LAm SI5
You know I'd do that for you

                    MIm
Is it me, is it you
                       LAm
Nothing that I can do
                        REm9  FA7+ SOL6
To make you change your mind
LAm                   MIm
 Is it me, is it you
                       LAm
Nothing that I can do
                 REm9   FA SOL
Is it a waste of time?
LAm                   MIm
 Is it me, is it you
                       LAm
