MIm             MIm9            REadd9
 I've done everything as you say
                   LA5                  MIm
I've followed your rules without question
                     MIm9               REadd9  LA5          
I thought it'd would help me see things clearly
MIm                     MIm9
 But instead of helping me to see
REadd9                  LA5
 I look around and it's like I'm blinded
MI5                     
 I'm spinning out of control
          DO5  MI5
Out of control
                       
I'm spinning out of control
          FA5
Out of control

MI5
 Where should I go?
DO5
 What should I do?
SOL5          SI5            DO5       RE5 
 I don't understand what you want from me
MI5   
'Cause I don't know
DO5
 If I can trust you
SI5           RE5                       MI5
 I don't understand what you want from me

MIm              MIm9
 I feel like I'm spinning out of control
REadd9            LA5                  MIm
 Try to focus but every thing's twisted
         MIm9                     REadd9   LA5
And all alone I thought you would be there
MIm        MIm9          REadd9
 To let me know I'm not alone
                    LA5           MI5
But in fact that's exactly what I was
                     
I'm spinning out of control
          DO5  MI5
Out of control

 Where should I go?
DO5
 What should I do?
SOL5          SI5            DO5       RE5 
 I don't understand what you want from me
MI5   
'Cause I don't know
DO5
 If I can trust you
SI5           RE5                   MI5
 All of the things you've said to me

          DO5            SOL5
And I may never know the answer
        SI5             MI5
To this endless mystery

Where should I go?
DO5               SI5
 What should I do?
             RE5                       MI5
I don't understand what you want from me
            DO5 MI5    FA5 MI5
It's in a myste-ry
            DO5 MI5    FA5
