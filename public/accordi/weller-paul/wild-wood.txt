SIm        SIm7/9 
High tide, mid afternoon
  LA7/4       SOLm/SIb SIm
People fly by,  in the traffics boom
                    SIm7/9
Knowing, just where you are blowing
LA7/4          SOLm/SIb        SIm
Getting to where you should be going

SIm           SIm7/9
Don't let them get you down
LA7/4         SOLm/SIb SIm
Making you feel        guilty about
                         SIm7/9
Golden rain, will bring you riches
LA7/4             SOLm/SIb SIm
All the good things       you deserve and now

SIm  SIm7/9  LA7/4 SOLm/SIb SIm

SIm            SIm7/9
Climbing, forever trying
LA7/4          SOLm/SIb  SIm
Find your way out of the wild, wild wood
              SIm7/9
Now there's no justice
  LA7/4     SOLm/SIb       SIm
Only yourself that you can trust in
                      SIm7/9
And I said high tide, mid afternoon
LA7/4        SOLm/SIb SIm
People fly by, in the traffics boom
                     SIm7/9
Knowing, just where you are blowing
LA7/4          SOLm/SIb        SIm
Getting to where you should be going

SIm   SIm7/9   LA7/4 SOLm/SIb SIm

SIm             SIm7/9
Day by day your world fades away
LA7/4         SOLm/SIb  SIm
Waiting to feel all the dreams that say
                        SIm7/9
Golden rain will bring you riches
LA7/4            SOLm/SIb SIm 
All the good things      you deserve now
                          SIm7/9
And I say, climbing, forever trying
LA7/4          SOLm/SIb   SIm
Find you way out   of the wild, wild wood
             LA7/4               SOLm/SIb
Said you are gonna find you way 
           SIm
out of the wild, wild wood

Wild wild wood
