Is happiness real?
           LAm7   LAb
Or am I so jaded
        DO         DO/SIb            LAm7    LAb
I can't see or feel, like a man been tainted
DO                     MIb/SIb  
Numbed by the effect, aware of the muse
       FA/LA                LAb
Too in touch with myself, I light the fuse

        DO         DO/SIb     LAm7           LAb
I'm the changingman, built on shifting sands
        DO         DO/SIb    LAm7       
I'm the changingman, waiting for the bang
     LAb
As I light a bitter fuse

DO  DO/SIb  LAm7  LAb

    DO             DO/SIb         LAm7    LAb
Our time is on loan, only ours to borrow
       DO            DO/SIb       LAm7    LAb
What I can't be today, I can be tomorrow
        DO              MIb/SIb
And the more I see, the more I know
    FA/LA            LAb
The more I know, the less I understand

        DO         DO/SIb     LAm7           LAb
I'm the changingman, built on shifting sands
        DO         DO/SIb    LAm7       
I'm the changingman, waiting for the bang
     LAb

It's a bigger part
         SIb       DO   LAm LAb
When our instincts act
  DO               LAm
A shot in the dark
  SIb         DO     LAm LAb
A movement in black
        DO              MIb/SIb
And the more I see, the more I know
    FA/LA            LAb
The more I know, the less I understand

I'm the changingman, built on shifting sands...
        DO         DO/SIb    LAm7       
I'm the changingman, waiting for the bang
     LAb
As I light a bitter fuse...
        DO         DO/SIb     LAm7           LAb
I'm the changingman, built on shifting sands
        DO         DO/SIb    LAm7       
I'm the changingman, waiting for the bang
     LAb                   DO
As I light a bitter fuse
