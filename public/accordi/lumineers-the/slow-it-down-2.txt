REb6/9   REb   

REb6/9                   REb   LAb/DO
 I feel her filth in my bones
SOLb                              REb/FA
 Wash off my hands 'til it's gone
SIbm
 The walls they're closing in
REb/LAb              REb6/9   REb
 With velvet curtains
REb6/9                      REb    REb/DO
 Some love was made for the lights
SOLb                                 REb/FA
 Some kiss your cheek and goodnight
SIbm
 Lift up a red high heel
REb/LAb                       REb6/9   REb
 Lock up your doors with steel
REb6/9                      REb    REb/DO
 They're makin' noise in my street
SOLb                              REb/FA
 My blinds are drawn I can't see
SIbm
 Smashed in my car window
REb/LAb                 REb6/9   REb
 Didn't touch the stereo

SOLb    SIbm        LAb          REb
Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
SOLb      SIbm      LAb       REb6/9   REb
Rest your arms, and rest your legs

REb6/9   REb

REb6/9                       REb   LAb/DO
 Act like you've been here before
SOLb                              REb/FA
 Smile less and dress up some more
SIbm
 Tie up your scarf real tight
REb/LAb                          REb6/9  REb
 These boys are out for blood tonight

SOLb    SIbm        LAb          REb
Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
SOLb      SIbm      LAb       REb6/9   REb
Rest your arms, and rest your legs

REb6/9   REb   SOLb   SIbm   REb6/9   REb

SOLb                            REb  REb/DO
 And when she stood, she stood tall
SOLb                           REb/FA
 She'll make a fool of you all
SIbm
 Don't ask for cigarettes
REb/LAb                          REb6/9   REb
 She ain't got nothin' left for you
REb6/9                                REb  REb/DO
 I never, she never, we never looked back
SOLb                              REb/FA
 That wasn't what we were good at
SIbm
 And when it came to love
REb/LAb                     REb6/9   REb
 We were not good enough uh huh

SOLb    SIbm        LAb          REb
Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
SOLb      SIbm      LAb       REb6/9   REb
Rest your arms, and rest your legs
SOLb      SIbm              LAb          REb
Don't you frown when you're feelin' like that
SOLb SIbm             LAb    REb
Only love can dig you out of this
