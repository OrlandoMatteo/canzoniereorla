
FA  DO      LAm                  FA     
 A falling star fell from your heart 
      DO         LAm    FA
and landed in my eyes
         DO     LAm                    FA
I screamed aloud, as it tore through them, 
      DO           LAm      FA
and now it's left me blind
         DO       LAm                          FA
The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
       DO          LAm     FA
You left me in the dark
       DO      LAm                          FA
No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight
            DO      LAm       FA
In the shadow of your heart
      DO     LAm                       FA
And in the dark, I can hear your heartbeat
       DO           LAm    FA
I tried to find the sound
        DO       LAm                       FA
But then it stopped, and I was in the darkness,
     DO         LAm    FA
So darkness I became
         DO        LAm                         FA
The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
       DO        LAm      FA
You left me in the dark
       DO     LAm                         FA
No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight
      DO              LAm    FA  DO  LAm
In the shadow of your heart

FA  DO  LAm    
 
MIm          FA                     SOL            LAm
 I took the stars from my eyes, and then I made a map
    MIm           FA          SOL         LAm
And knew that somehow I could find my way back
       MIm              FA    
Then I heard your heart beating, 
                SOL        LAm
you were in the darkness too
    MIm            FA            LAm
So I stayed in the darkness with you

FA        DO        LAm                         FA
 The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
       DO        LAm       FA
You left me in the dark
       DO     LAm                        FA
No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight
     DO               LAm     FA  DO  LAm
In the shadow of your heart

FA  DO  LAm      FA  DO  LAm     FA  DO  LAm

FA  DO  LAm      FA  DO  LAm
