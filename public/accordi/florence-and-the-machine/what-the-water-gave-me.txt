Time it took us
   DOm        MIb
To where the water was
LAb7+           SOLm  DOm
That's what the water gave me
    MIb          LAb7+ SOLm
And time goes quicker
   DOm      MIb
Between the two of us
LAb7+        SOLm     DOm
Oh, my love, don't forsake me
MIb                 FAadd9
Take what the water gave me

       FA5  DOm
Lay me do----wn
        MIb  SIb
Let the only sound
       LAb DOm
Be the overflow
        MIb     SIb
Pockets full of stones
       FA5  DOm
Lay me do-----wn
        MIb  SIb
Let the only sound
       LAb DOm MIb   MIb/SOL
Be the o---ver-flow

DOm  

    MIb      LAb7+ SOLm
And oh, poor Atlas
              DOm           MIb
The world's a beast of a burden
            LAb7+    SOLm DOm
You've been holding on a long time
    MIb      LAb7+   SOLm
And all this longing
        DOm        MIb
And the ships are left to rust
LAb7+           SOLm  FAadd9
That's what the water gave us

       FA5  DOm
Lay me do----wn
        MIb  SIb
Let the only sound
       LAb DOm
Be the overflow
        MIb     SIb
Pockets full of stones
       FA5  DOm
Lay me do-----wn
        MIb  SIb
Let the only sound
       LAb DOm MIb   MIb/SOL
Be the o---ver-flow

                      SIb
'Cause they took your loved ones
                       FAm9
But returned them in exchange for you
                          LAb       SIb
But would you have it any other way?
          FA5         LAb
Would you have it any other way?
          SIb         FA5       DOm
You could have it any other way
               MIb   LAb     SOLm
'Cause she's a cruel mistress
        DOm     MIb   
And the bargain must be made
    LAb    SOLm        DOm
But oh, my love, don't forget me
     MIb             LAb   SOLm FAadd9
When I let the water take me

       FA5  DOm
Lay me do----wn
        MIb  SIb
Let the only sound
       LAb DOm
Be the overflow
        MIb     SIb
Pockets full of stones
       FA5  DOm
Lay me do-----wn
        MIb  SIb
Let the only sound
       LAb DOm LAb7+  SIb
Be the o---ver-flow...
