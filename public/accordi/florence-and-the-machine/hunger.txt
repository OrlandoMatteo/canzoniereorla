At seventeen, I started to starve myself
  SOLm                               DO       
I thought that love was a kind of emptiness

And at least I understood then, the hunger I felt
      SOLm                       DO
And I didn't have to call it loneliness

 Tell me what you need, oh, you look so free

The way you use your body, baby,

come on and work it for me

you're the best thing I've seen

 I thought that love was in the drugs

But the more I took, the more it took away

You don't have to be afraid
REm                                   LAm/DO
And then it tries to find a home with people, 

or when I'm alone
SOL/SI               SIb                  REm/LA
Picking it apart and staring at your phone
