
        LAb                      REb        LAb
You can lie to yourself, you can lie to the world
        LAb                MIb       LAb
You can lie to the one you call your girl
        LAb                    REb             LAb
You can humble yourself to the hearts that you stole
          LAb                       MIb      LAb
Wondering who's gonna love you when you grow old 

       FAm                      REb
With a fistful of courage and a heart full of rage
  LAb                   MIb
I realized I'd locked myself in a cage
            FAm                        REb
I'll be the one standing there with my watery eyes
            LAb                MIb
I'll be the fool in the mirror asking you why
          LAb
...asking why,

       LAb                  REb       LAb
When I got to the end of my dirty rainbow
      LAb                  MIb       LAb
and I found that there was no pot of gold
  LAb                          REb          LAb
I learned that I was empty and not quite as strong
          LAb                 MIb        LAb
for I had robbed my heart and cheated my soul 

FAm                       REb
Look for the one with the watery eyes
            LAb                MIb
I'll be the fool in the mirror asking you why
        FAm              REb
Cursing lovers in a warm tender embrace
LAb                           MIb
Scoffing at the world and the whole human race 

        FAm          REb
You can run, you can hide
        LAb               MIb
You can feed your foolish pride
        FAm     REb
You can use and abuse
       LAb               MIb
In the end you'll always lose...at the game 

FAm    REb   LAb   MIb

FAm    REb   LAb   MIb

        FAm          REb
You can run, you can hide
        LAb               MIb
You can feed your foolish pride
         FAm             REb
with the hearts that you stole
       LAb          MIb
and an empty pot of gold
        FAm            REb
and the lover's warm embrace
        LAb                MIb
and the whole damned human race
        FAm     REb
You can use and abuse
       LAb               MIb           LAb
in the end you'll always lose...at the game 

      LAb               REb  LAb
For I cheated myself at soli-taire
