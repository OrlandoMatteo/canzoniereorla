Woah, oh, oh, oh
SIb             MIb        
For the longest time
SIb   MIb LAb
Woah, oh, oh
SIb               
For the longest

MIb SIb/RE DOm7 SIb LAb         MIb
If  you    said goodbye to me tonight
      SIb/RE DOm7  SIb LAm7/5- FA7     SIb
There would  still be  music   left to write
SOL7             DOm
 What else could I do
SIb7/RE   MIb    MIb7
 I'm so inspired by you
LAb          FAm7             SIb7    MIb
 That hasn't happened for the longest time

MIb  SIb/RE DOm7    SIb LAb           MIb
Once I      thought my  innocence was gone
    SIb/RE DOm7 SIb  LAm7/5- FA7       SIb
Now I      know that happi---ness goes on
SOL7              DOm
 That's where you found me
SIb7/RE           MIb    MIb7
When you put your arms around me
LAb        FAm7               SIb7    MIb
 I haven't been there for the longest time

MIb   SIb MIb LAb
Woah, oh, oh, oh
SIb             MIb        
For the longest time
SIb   MIb LAb
Woah, oh, oh
SIb               
For the longest

MIb SIb/RE DOm7  SIb    LAb            MIb
I'm that   voice you're hearing in the hall
    SIb/RE DOm7 SIb  LAm7/5- FA7   SIb
And the    grea-test mira----cle of  all
SOL7      DOm
 Is how I need you
SIb7/RE      MIb       MIb7
 And how you needed me too
LAb          FAm7             SIb7    MIb
 That hasn't happened for the longest time


SIb              DOm     
Maybe this won't last very long
    RE7         
But you feel so right
    MIb
And I could be wrong
SOLm            DOm
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
    FA7 
But I've gone this far
         SIb         SIb7
And it's more than I hoped for


MIb SIb/RE DOm7 SIb  LAb              MIb
Who knows  how  much further we'll go on
   SIb/RE DOm7 SIb LAm7/5- FA7         SIb
Maybe     I'll be  sorry   when you're gone
SOL7          DOm
 I'll take my chances
SIb7/RE      MIb    MIb7
I forgot how nice romance is
LAb        FAm7               SIb7    MIb    
 I haven't been there for the longest time


SIb          DOm
I had second thoughts at the start
  RE7
I said to myself
     MIb
Hold on to your heart
SOLm           DOm           
Now I know the woman that you are
       FA7
You're wonderful so far
         SIb         SIb7
And it's more than I hoped for


MIb SIb/RE DOm7 SIb  LAb            MIb
I   don't  care what consequence it brings
  SIb/RE DOm7 SIb LAm7/5-  FA7    SIb
I have   been a   fool for lesser things
SOL7        DOm
 I want you so bad
SIb7/RE      MIb      MIb7
 I think you ought to know
     LAb         FAm7             SIb7    MIb
That I intend to hold you for the longest time

MIb   SIb MIb LAb
Woah, oh, oh, oh
SIb             MIb        
For the longest time
SIb   MIb LAb
Woah, oh, oh
SIb             MIb        
For the longest time
SIb   MIb LAb
Woah, oh, oh
SIb             MIb        
For the longest time
SIb   MIb LAb
Woah, oh, oh...
