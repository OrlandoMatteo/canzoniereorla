Well I'm on the Downeaster Alexa
        DO               SOL          FA
And I'm cruisin' through Block Island Sound
                 DO            REm
I have charted a course to the vineyard
      DO         SOL       FA
But tonight I am Nantucket bound
           SOL            DO/MI         FA
We took on diesel back in Mantauk yesterday
              SOL
And left this morning 
         LAm                SOL/SI  FA
from the bell in Gardiner's Bay
             SOL              DO/MI          FA
Like all the locals here I've had to sell my home
             SOL              LAm            SOL/SI
Too proud to leave, I work my fingers to the bone

           DO          SOL    LAm
So I could own my Downeaster Alexa
      DO           SOL      FA
And I go where the ocean is deep
                     DO           REm
There are giants out there in the canyons
      DO           SOL         FA
And a good captain can't fall asleep

FA     SOL              DO/MI             FA
 I got bills to pay and children who need clothes
               SOL                LAm
I know there's fish out there but where, 
         SOL/SI   FA
God only knows
               SOL
They say these waters aren't 
DO/MI             FA
what they used to be
             SOL            FA/LA

             SOL/SI
who count on me

          DO          SOL    LAm
So if you see my Downeaster Alexa
           DO            SOL         FA
And if you work with the rod and the reel
                  DO        REm
Tell my wife I am trawling Atlantis
      DO            SOL          FA
And I still have my hands on the wheel...

LAm         MIm         LAm

      DO           SOL     LAm
Now I drive my Downeaster Alexa
         DO              SOL         FA
More and more miles from shore every year
                     DO            REm
Since they told me I can't sell no stripers
            DO         SOL          FA
And there's no luck in swordfishing here
        SOL            DO/MI        FA
I was a Bayman like my father was before
             SOL         FA/LA     SOL/SI
Can't make a living as a Bayman anymore
FA                SOL
 There ain't much future 
      DO/MI             FA
for a man who works the sea
                   SOL
But there ain't no island left 
    FA/LA          SOL/SI
for Islanders like me...

DO  SOL  LAm       DO  SOL  LAm

DO  SOL  LAm       DO  SOL  LAm
