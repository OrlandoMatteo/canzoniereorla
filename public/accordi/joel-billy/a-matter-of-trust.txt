RE                   SIm
 Some love is just a lie of the heart
RE                          SIm
 The cold remains of what began 
                  FA#m7
with a passionate start
                            LA
And they may not want it to end
                                     RE
But it will it's just a question of when
                 SIm
I've lived long enough to have learned
RE                         SIm
 The closer you get to the fire 
                  FA#m7
the more you get burned
                          LA
But that won't happen to us
                                      RE  SIm
Because it's always been a matter of trust

RE   SIm

RE                 SIm
 I know you're an emotional girl
RE                        SIm
 It took a lot for you to not lose 
                   FA#m7
your faith in this world
                  LA
I can't offer you proof
                                     RE
But you're going to face a moment of truth
                      SIm           RE
It's hard when you're always afraid
                       SIm                FA#m7
You just recover when another belief is betrayed
                         LA
So break my heart of you must
 
It's a matter of trust
 
    SOL6
You can't go the distance
     RE/FA#
With too much resistance
  MIm7          LA
I know you have doubts
    RE7+                         SOL  LA
But for god's sake don't shut me out

RE                    SIm
 This time you've got nothing to lose
RE                        SIm
 You can take it, you can leave it
             FA#m7
Whatever you choose
                     LA
I won't hold back anything
                                 RE
And I'll walk a way a fool or a king
                    SIm
Some love is just a lie of the mind
RE                            SIm
 It's make believe until it's only 
            FA#m7
a matter of time
                                 LA
And some might have learned to adjust
                                     RE   SIm
But then it never was a matter of trust

RE   SIm   FA#m7      LA

    SOL6
I'm sure you're aware love
      RE/FA#
We've both had our share of
  MIm7        LA
Believing too long
         RE7+                SOL   LA
When the whole situation was wrong

RE                   SIm
 Some love is just a lie of the soul

A constant battle 
RE           SIm              FA#m7
 for the ultimate state of control
                            LA
After you've heard lie upon lie
                                   RE
There can hardly be a question of why
                    SIm
Some love is just a lie of the heart
RE                          SIm
 The cold remains of what began 
                  FA#m7
with a passionate start
                         LA
But that can't happen to us
                                     RE   SIm
Because it's always been a matter of trust...
