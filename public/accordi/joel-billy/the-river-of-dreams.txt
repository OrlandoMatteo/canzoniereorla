SOL    DO7+  RE6  

SOL    DO  RE

                     SOL
In the middle of the night

I go walking in my sleep
                      DO
From the mountains of faith
              RE
To a river so deep
                      SOL
I must be looking for something
            DO/SOL SOL
Something sacred I lost
        SOL7     DO
But the river is wide
                     RE
And it's too hard to cross
MIm                         RE6
 And even though I know the river is wide
       DO7+                     SIm7
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
DO7+                     SIm7
 And try to cross to the opposite side
         LA7
So I can finally find out
               RE         RE7
what I've been looking for

                     SOL
In the middle of the night
     DO/SOL      SOL
I go walking in my sleep
            SOL7      DO
Through the valley of fear
              RE
To a river so deep
                  DO/RE    SOL
And I've been searching for something
       DO/SOL   SOL
Taken out of my soul
            SOL7        DO
Something I would never lose
                   RE
Something somebody stole
MIm                    RE6
 I don't know why I go walking at night
            DO7+
But now I'm tired 
                    SIm7          DO7+
and I don't want to walk anymore
                           SIm7
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
        LA7
Until I find what it is 
               RE           RE7
that I've been looking for
                     SOL
In the middle of the night

I go walking in my sleep
            SOL7      DO
Through the jungle of doubt
              RE
To a river so deep
                         SOL
I know I'm searching for something

Something so undefined
            SOL7    DO
That it can only be seen
                   RE
By the eyes of the blind
                     SOL     DO   RE7 
In the middle of the night

SOL      SOL7 DO   RE7

MIm                   RE6
 I'm not sure about a life after this
    DO7+
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
DO7+             SIm7                  LA7
 Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
                 RE           RE7
That runs to the promised land

                     SOL
In the middle of the night
    
I go walking in my sleep
            SOL7      DO
Through the desert of truth
                RE
To the river so deep
                  SOL
We all end in the ocean
                
We all start in the streams
          SOL7     DO
We're all carried along
                RE
By the river of dreams
                     SOL    DO  RE
In the middle of the night...

SOL      DO   RE
