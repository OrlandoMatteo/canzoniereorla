          LA          SOL
I used to hate you so easily
SIm                     FA#m
 Look into your eyes so eagerly
LA                  SOL   SIm
And where there was cold
           FA#m      
I wouldn't walk away
       LA                          SOL    SIm
'Cause where there's money love is blind

It's so blind
LA          SOL
But after a time
     SIm                   LA

Loving ourselves comes so easily

 Forgiveness was like the biggest sin to me
LA                  SOL    SIm7
And where there was war
           FA#m
I wouldn't walk away
