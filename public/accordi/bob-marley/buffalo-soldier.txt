      Ooh,  He - ey, oh
DOm7/5-               SI7+              SIb6-
What we're living in,    let me tell ya

       MIbm7          LAb7       
It's a wonder man can eat at all
     REb9                SOLb7+
When things are big that should be small
DOm7/5-           SI7+
Who can tell what magic spells 
SIb6-         MIbm7
Will be doing for us?
        MIbm7         LAb7       
And I'm giving all my love to this world
REb9       SOLb7+
   Only to be told
DOm7/5-      SI7+
I can't see, I can't breathe, 
SIb6-           MIbm7   SOLb7+
no more will we be
    LAb7                          REb9           
And nothing's going to change the way we live
     SOLb7+                 DOm7/5-      
Cos' we can always take but never give
    SI7+                        SIb6-
An' now that things're changing for the worse, see. 
MIbm7 
    Woah,       
LAb7              REb9       
     It's a crazy world we're living in
SOLb7+                DOm7/5-
     And I just can't see that 
        SI7+           SIb6-         SIb7    REm7/5-
Half of us immersed in sin is all we have to give these

SI7+    REm7/5- MIbm7   SOLb7+  LAb7   SIb7    
Futures made of virtu - al    insani - ty now
SI7+   REm7/5-    MIbm7    SOLb7+  LAb7    SIb7        
Always seem to be governed by this love we have for
SI7+     REm7/5-  MIbm7  SOLb7+   LAb7   SIb7   
Useless, twisting of the new  techno - logy
    SI7+            REm7/5-       MIbm7    SOLb7+ LAb7
Oh, now there is no sound, for we all live under- ground

SIb7    MIbm7           LAb7     
And I'm thinking what a mess we're in
REb9               SOLb7+
Hard to know where to begin
   DOm7/5-          SI7+
If I could slip the sickly ties 
     SIb6-   REm7/5- MIbm7   SOLb7+
That earthly man has made
    LAb7      REb9   SOLb7+           DOm7/5- 
And now every mother can choose the colour
SI7+          SIb6-      REm7/5-  MIbm7   SOLb7+
Of her child, that's not nature's way
     LAb7                        REb9            
Well that's what they said yesterday
        SOLb7+                 DOm7/5-   
There's nothing left to do but pray
  SI7+                       SIb6-    REm7/5-  MIbm7   SOLb7+
I think it's time I found  a new    religion,  wo  - ah,
     LAb7         REb9        SOLb7+
it's so insane to synthesize another strain
        DOm7/5-            SI7+            SIb6-    REm7
There's something in these futures that we have  to be told

SI7+    REm7/5- MIbm7   SOLb7+  LAb7   SIb7    
Futures made of virtu - al    insani - ty now
SI7+   REm7/5-    MIbm7    SOLb7+  LAb7    SIb7

Oh, now there is no sound, for we all live under- ground

SI7+         REm7/5-   MIbm7 SOLb7+   LAb7 SIb7  
Now there is no sound, if we all live underground
SI7+                  REm7/5-    
    And now it's virtual insanity
MIbm7         SOLb7+    LAb7  SIb7
  Forget your virtual real - ity
SI7+                     REm7/5-  MIbm7  SOLb7+  LAb7  SIb7    
     Oh, there's nothing so bad.
SI7+    REm7/5-    MIbm7   SOLb7+   LAb7  SIb7    
                 I know    yeah
