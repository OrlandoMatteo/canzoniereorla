                      SIm  SOL MIm
The world is a vampire
        LA  SIm  SOL MIm
sent to drain
          LA     SIm  SOL MIm
Secret destroyers
         LA        SIm  SOL MIm
hold you up to the flames
    LA          SIm  SOL MIm
And what do I get
       LA   SIm  SOL MIm
for my pain?
           LA   SIm  SOL MIm
Betrayed desires
      LA           SIm  MIm SOL
and a piece of the game
LA   SIm    MIm SOL
Even though I know
LA   SIm  MIm  SOL
I suppose I'll show
LA     SIm  MIm SOL
All my cool and cold
LA       SIm SOL LA
like old job

   SI5     LA5 SOL5      RE5
Despite all my rage I am still
       LA5      MI5   SOL5
just a rat in a cage
SI5        LA5 SOL5      RE5
Despite all my rage I am still
       LA5      MI5   SOL5
just a rat in a cage
     SI5      LA5 SOL5        RE5
Then someone will say what is lost
    LA5      MI5   SOL5
can never be saved
SI5        LA5 SOL5      RE5
Despite all my rage I am still
       LA5      MI5   SOL5  MI5 LA5
just a rat in a cage

              SIm  SOL MIm
Now I'm naked
        LA        SIm  SOL MIm
nothing but an animal
            LA     SIm  SOL MIm
But can you fake it
         LA       SIm   SOL MIm
for just one more show?
         LA       SIm  SOL MIm
And what do you want?
          LA     SIm  SOL MIm
I want to change
              LA     SIm  SOL MIm
And what have you got
         LA       SIm  MIm SOL 
when you feel the same?
LA   SIm    MIm SOL
Even though I know
LA   SIm  MIm  SOL
I suppose I'll show
LA     SIm  MIm SOL
All my cool and cold
LA       SIm SOL LA
like old job
