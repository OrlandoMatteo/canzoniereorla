 Right from the start I    knew we could never part
          SOL#m7           SI       FA#
Something magic in the way that you move
DO#m7          RE#m7 MI7+
 Oh what a shame we  could never feel the pain
         SOL#m7            SI     FA# 
That our past tried to put in our view
                   DO#m7    RE#m7 MI7+
This feeling it surrounds me,    ohh
            SOL#m7            SI FA#
Turning me around 'til I lose control

This feeling it surrounds me,  ohh
              SOL#m7            SI   FA#

SOL#m7       SI   FA#
Same walk, new pace

Go on tie your shoe lace

Ain't got a lotta money,    but got a lotta time
         SOL#m7                 SI
