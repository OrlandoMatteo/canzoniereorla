
Intro:
FA  SIb  FA  SIb

FA  SIb  FA  SIb

          FA               SIb
Well I've heard those city singers 
         FA                SIb
singin' 'bout how they can love,
FA              SIb
Deeper than the oceans, 
       FA              SIb
higher than the stars above
      FA              SIb
Well, I come from the country, 
      FA           DO      SIb
and I know I ain't seen it all
      FA                 SIb
But I heard that ocean's salty, 
        FA          SIb       FA
and the stars, they sometimes fall
    SOLm  
And that would not do justice 
       LAm
to the way I feel for you
     SIb              FA/LA
So I had to sing this song 
      SOLm7            DO7
about all the things I knew
 
           FA              SIb
My love is deeper than the holler
FA                SIb
Stronger than the river
REm             SOLm7
Higher than the pine trees 
        SIb           DO7
growin' tall upon the hill
           FA             SIb
My love is purer than the snowflakes,
     FA      DO/MI  REm
That fall in late December
    SOLm7       FA/LA
And honest as a Robin 
     SIb
on a springtime window sill
    SOLm            DO7               FA   REm  SOLm7  DO7
And longer than the song of a whippoorwill

         FA                SIb
From the back roads to the Broadway 
             FA               SIb
shows with a million miles between,
          FA
There's a least a million 
 SIb            FA     SIb     FA
love songs that people love to sing
    SOLm
And every one is different, 
    LAm
and every one's the same
    SIb           FA/LA
And this is just another way 
   SOLm7           DO7
of sayin' the same thing

           FA              SIb
My love is deeper than the holler
FA                SIb
Stronger than the river
REm             SOLm7
Higher than the pine trees 
        SIb           DO7
growin' tall upon the hill
           FA             SIb
My love is purer than the snowflakes,
     FA      DO/MI  REm
That fall in late December
    SOLm7       FA/LA
And honest as a Robin 
     SIb
on a springtime window sill
    SOLm            DO7                FA  REm  SOLm7  DO7
And longer than the song of a whippoorwill

FA  REm  SOLm7  DO

           FA              SIb
My love is deeper than the holler
FA                SIb
Stronger than the river
REm             SOLm7
Higher than the pine trees 
        SIb           DO7
growin' tall upon the hill
           FA             SIb
My love is purer than the snowflakes,
     FA      DO/MI  REm
That fall in late December
    SOLm7       FA/LA
And honest as a Robin 
     SIb
on a springtime window sill
    SOLm            DO7                FA  REm  SOLm7  DO7
And longer than the song of a whippoorwill
           FA  REm  SOLm7  DO7  FA
A Whippoorwill
