It's hard for girls like us
              SOLb
We don't know who we trust
             REb
Not even the ones we love
                    LAb
'Cause they don't know

SIbm
Stuck here
                    SOLb
Stuck here in these waters
              REb
So sick to my stomach
           LAb      
Is anybody there?
SIbm
Red lights
                  SOLb
Red lights in the darkness
              REb
Everyone's so heartless
             LAb
Does anybody care?
        SIbm
It's so hard to explain
          SOLb
With your heart in a cage
     REb                   LAb
Only whisper but you wanna shout
           SIbm
'Cause the second you wake
         SOLb
Too much pressure to take
      REb                      LAb
Every part of you wants to cry out

Not even the ones we love
                    LAb
'Cause they don't know
       SIbm
Try to numb this pain
                          SOLb
'Cause we don't wanna get hurt again
               REb
Left alone out in the rain
             LAb
They don't know

SIbm                  SOLb
Mirror, mirror on the wall
                  REb
I don't see beautiful
                 LAb
Staring back at me
SIbm                        SOLb
Watching, watching my heart bleed out
              REb       LAb
Trying not to freak out

So, oh
        
And the worst part is
          LAb
When they smile like this
                  SIbm
And it hits me hard
          FAm  SOLb
Hits me hard...

Tryna play it cool
      LAb
But inside I'm bruised
                   SIbm
And it breaks my heart
            LAb
Breaks my heart...
