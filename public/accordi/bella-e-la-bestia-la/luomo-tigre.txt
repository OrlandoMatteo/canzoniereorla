RE#7
 Day by day night after night

Blinded by the neon lights

Hurry here hustling there

No one's got the time to spare

Money's tight nothing free

Won't somebody come and rescue me

I am stranded

Caught in the crossfire

Stranded

Caught in the crossfire

RE#7
 Tooth for tooth eye for an eye

Sell your soul just to buy, buy, buy

Begging a dollar stealing a dime

Come on can't you see that I

I'm stranded

Caught in the crossfire

I'm stranded

Caught in the crossfire

FA#7        SOL#7 
 I need some kind of kindness
FA#7               SOL#7
 Some kind of sympathy oh no
      RE#7
We're stranded

Caught in the crossfire...

RE#7
 Save the strong lose the weak

Never turning the other cheek

Trust nobody don't be no fool

Whatever happened to the golden rule

We got stranded

Caught in the crossfire

We got stranded

Caught in the crossfire

We got stranded

Caught in the crossfire

Stranded

Caught in the crossfire

Help me...
