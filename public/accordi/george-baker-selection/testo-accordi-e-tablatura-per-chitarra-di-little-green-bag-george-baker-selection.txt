SIb  DOm
  in this proud land we grew up strong
SIb     MIb            
we were wanted all along
      SIb
I was taught to fight, taught to win
        DOm                  SIb/DO
I never thought I could fail
DOm                 
no fight left or so it seems
       SIb       MIb               LAb MIb
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted
               SIb
I've changed my face, I've changed my name
           DOm             
but no one wants you when you lose

FAm7/4 MIbadd9/SOL
 don't give up
         LAbadd9
'cos you have friends
FAm7/4 MIbadd9/SOL
 don't give up
           LAb7+

FAm7/4 MIbadd9/SOL
 don't give up
  LAb          SIb
I know you can make it good

DOm
though I saw it all around
      SIb     MIb          MIb4 MIb
never thought I could be affected
             SIb
thought that we'd be the last to go
         DOm             SIb/DO DOm     
it is so strange the way things turn
                  SIb/DO  DOm  
drove the night toward my home
                     MIb          MIb4 MIb   
the place that I was born, on the lakeside
            SIb 
as daylight broke, I saw the earth
              DOm
the trees had burned down to the ground

FAm7/4  MIbadd9/SOL
  don't give up
    LAbadd9
you still have us
FAm7/4  MIbadd9/SOL
  don't give up
         LAb7+
we don't need much of anything
FAm7/4  MIbadd9/SOL
  don't give up
       LAb                 SIb
'cause somewhere there's a place
           MIb
where we belong

          SIb
rest your head
            MIb
you worry too much
                   SIb
it's going to be alright
     MIb
when times get rough
             LAb     MIb
you can fall back on us
               SIb
don't give up
         MIb
please don't give up

'got to walk out of here
      SIb
I can't take anymore
         MIb
going to stand on that bridge
        LAb
keep my eyes down below
   MIb
whatever may come
       SIb
and whatever may go
          MIb        SIb
that river's flowing
          MIb
that river's flowing

DOm
moved on to another town
              MIb        
tried hard to settle down
          SIb
for every job, so many men
        DOm         
so many men no-one needs

FAm7/4  MIbadd9/SOL

FAm7/4  MIbadd9/SOL

           LAb             SIb4
'cause I believe there's a place

there's a place where we belong
