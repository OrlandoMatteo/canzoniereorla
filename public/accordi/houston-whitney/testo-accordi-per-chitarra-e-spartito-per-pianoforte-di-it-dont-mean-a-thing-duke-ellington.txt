 Winter's city-side
          
Crystal bits of snowflakes 
DO#5                        LA#5          
all around my head and in the wind
RE#5              SI5        
 I had no illusions
                     DO#5
That I'd ever find a glimpse 
                           LA#5
of summer's heat-waves in your eyes
RE#m     SI              DO#add9
 You did what you did to me, 
         LA#5      SI
now it's history I see
          SOL#5           LA#5
Here's my comeback on the road again
RE#m         SI                DO#add9
 Things will happen while they can
       LA#5             SI
I will wait here for my man tonight, 
     SOL#5            LA#5
it's easy when you're big in Japan

Big in Japan, it's easy to be

RE#5           SI5
 Neon on my skin
                       DO#5
Passing silhouettes of strange 
                LA#5        
illuminated mannequins
RE#5                      SI5
 Shall I stay here at the zoo
                            DO#5  
Or shall I go and change my point of view 
             LA#5
for other ugly scenes
RE#m     SI              DO#add9
 You did what you did to me,
