If you see me walking down the street
    RE         LAm7 RE            LAm7
And I start to cry  each time we meet


RE      SOLm7  LAm7      SOLm7
Walk on by,      walk on by
LAm7        
Make believe

That you don't see the tears
     LAm7
Just let me grieve

In private 'cause each time I see you
                 FA7+  SIbadd9
I break down and cry
            FA7+      SIbadd9
And walk on by (don't stop)
            FA7+      SIbadd9

The tears and the sadness you gave me
                  FA7+  SIbadd9
When you said goodbye
