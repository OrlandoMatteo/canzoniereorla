MI
 I got to say it and it's hard for me
DO#m7           
 You got me crying like I thought I would never be
FA#m7
 Love is believing, but you let me down
                           SI                    
How can I love you when you ain't around
     MI
And I get to the morning and you never call
 DO#m7
Love should be everything or not at all
FA#m7
 And it don't matter whatever you do
                    SI
I made a life out of loving you
SOL#m7   DO#m     SOL#m7       DO#m     SOL#m7
Only to find any dream that I follow is dying
    FA#m7  SI     SOL#m7
I'm crying in the rain
            DO#m         SOL#m7      DO#m    SOL#m7 
I could be searching my world for a love everlasting

MI                      FA#m7  SI
 Why do you have to be a  heartbreaker
SOL#m7                LA     SI
 Is it a lesson that I never knew
SOL#m7      DO#m       SOL#m7         DO#m
Got to get out of the spell that I'm under
LA            SOL#m7   SI
  My love for you
MI                      FA#m7  SI
 Why do you have to be a  heartbreaker
SOL#m7                     LA         SI
 When I was being what you want me to be
SOL#m7     DO#m       SOL#m7 DO#m
Suddenly, everything I ever wanted
LA              SOL#m7
  Has passed me by
               FA#m7  
This world may end
            MI
Not you and I

MI
 My love is stronger than the universe
 DO#m7
My soul is crying for you and that cannot be reversed
FA#m7
 You made the rules and you could not see
                      SI           
You made a life out of hurting me
SOL#m7     DO#m       SOL#m7      DO#m    SOL#m7
Out of my mind, I am held by the power of you, love
        LA7+
Tell me when do we try
          LAm
Or should we say goodbye
