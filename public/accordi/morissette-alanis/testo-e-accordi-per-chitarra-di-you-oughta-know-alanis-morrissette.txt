I want you to know that I'm happy for you.
FA#m7                  SI/FA#
I wish nothing but the best for you both.

Another version of me Is she preverted like me?
             SI/FA#
Would she go down on you in a theatre?
               FA#m7
Does she speak eloquently?

And would she have your baby?
               SI/FA#
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother.

           FA#m7
'Cause the love that you gave that we made

wasn't able to make it enough for you
      SI/FA#
to be open wide. No,
    FA#m7
and everytime you speak her name
                            
does she know how you told me you'd hold me
  SI/FA#
until you died?

'Til you died, but you're still alive.

       LA                     SI

         FA#       MI
It's not fair to deny me
       LA                    SI
of the cross I bare that you gave to me.
SI    
You, you, you oughta know.

You seem very well. 
SI/FA#
Things look peaceful.
FA#m7
I'm not quite as well. 
SI/FA#
I thought you should know.

           FA#m7
Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity?
          SI/FA#
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner.
         FA#m7
It was a slap in the face

how quickly I was replaced,
            SI/FA#
and are you thinking of me when you fuck her?

           FA#m7
'Cause the love that you gave that we made

in the bed that was me,

    FA#m7
