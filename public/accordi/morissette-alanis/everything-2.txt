SIb                        SIb4+
I can be an asshole of the grandest kind
SIb                           SIb4+
I can withhold like it's going out of style
SIb                    SIb4+
I can be the moodiest baby, 
     
and you've never met anyone
SIb            SIb4+
 As negative I am sometimes
SIb                     DO7/SOL
I am the wisest woman you've ever met
SIb                                    DO7/SOL
I am the kindest soul with whom you've connected
SIbadd9                            DO7/SOL
I have the bravest heart that you've

Ever seen, and you've never met anyone
SIb/FA       DO7/MI
 As positive as I am sometimes

           SIb
You see everything
           MIbadd9
You see every part
            SIb
You see all my light
             MIbadd9
And you love my dark
           SIb
You dig everything
             MIbadd9
Of which I'm ashamed
             SIb
There's not anything
                   MIbadd9
To which you can't relate
                   SIb
And you're still here

SIb                           DO7/SOL
I blame everyone else, not my own partaking
SIb                            DO7/SOL:
My passive aggressiveness can be devastating
SIb                 DO7/SOL
I'm terrified and mistrusting, 

and you've never met anyone
SIb/FA                 DO7/MI
 As close to down as I am sometimes

           SIb

To which you can't relate
                   SIb
And you're still here

     FA           MIb
What I resist, persists,
           FA           MIb
And speaks louder than I know
    FA            MIb
But I resist, you love,
          FA              MIb
No matter how low or high I go

SIb                                DO7/SOL
I'm the funniest woman that you've ever known
SIb                               DO7/SOL
I'm the dullest woman that you've ever known
SIb                                  
I'm the most gorgeous woman that you've
DO7/SOL                   
Ever known, and you've never met anyone
SIb/FA              DO7/MI
 As everything as I am sometimes
