This world can hurt you
   DOm                        SIb
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
FA/LA        SOLm                                                        
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
                          
And nothing breaks like a heart

  SOLm
I heard you on the phone last night
   FA
We live and die by pretty lies
    SOLm
You know it, oh, we both know it

These silver bullet cigarettes
     FA 
This burning house, there's nothing left
     SOLm
It's smoking, we both know it
   
We got all night to fall in love
    FA
But just like that we fall apart
      SOLm
We're broken, we're broken

Mmm, well nothing, nothing, nothing gon' save us now

              MIb
Well, there's broken silence
   DOm                     SOLm
By thunder crashing in the dark (crash in the dark)
         MIb
And this broken record
     DOm                    SOLm
Spin endless circles in the bar (spin 'round in the bar)
     MIb
This world can hurt you

It cuts you deep and leaves a scar

Mhmm, and nothing breaks like a heart

      SOLm
We'll leave each other cold as ice
    FA 
And high and dry, the desert wind
   SOLm
Is blowin', is blowin'

Remember what you said to me?
        FA
We were drunk in love in Tennessee
      SOLm
And I hold it, we both know it

Mmm, nothing, nothing, nothing gon' save us now

Nothing, nothing, nothing gon' save us now
