   REm                    FA
We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain
   DO              SOLm
We jumped never asking why
   REm              FA
We kissed, I fell under your spell
  DO                  SOLm
A love no one could deny

               REm          SIb
I never hit so hard in love
                    FA               DO
All I wanted was to break your walls

I put you high up in the sky
     DO                SOLm
And now, you're not coming down
   REm                FA
It slowly turned, you let me burn
    DO                   SOLm
And now, we're ashes on the ground
SIb                REm

Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
                      FA          DO
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
