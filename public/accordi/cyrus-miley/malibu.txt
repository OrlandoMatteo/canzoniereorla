I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
DOm                REb             DOm
I never sat by the shore under the sun
                  REb
 with my feet in the sand
                 LAb            LAb4         LAb
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
       LAb4      LAb             LAb4      LAb    LAb4
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind
LAb                               LAb4  LAb   LAb4
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
  DOm
I never went boatin', 
      REb 
don't get how they are floatin'
    DOm                REb
And sometimes I get so scared
                   FAm     SIbm7
Of what I can't understand
           LAb  DOm7
But here I am
        FAm  SIbm7
Next to you
           LAb       DOm7
The sky's more blue
    FAm    SIbm7
In Malibu
         LAb  DOm7
Next to you
    FAm    SIbm7
In Malibu
         LAb DOm7
Next to you, baby

LAb                        LAb4       LAb     LAb4
We watched the sun go down as we were walking
LAb                          LAb4
I'd spend the rest of my life 
                   LAb       LAb4
just standing here talking
LAb4                          LAb4     LAb    LAb4
You would explain the current as I just smile
DOm                     REb
Hoping that you'll stay the same 
                 DOm
and nothing will change
          REb              LAb
And it'll be us just for a while
        LAb4 LAb
Do they even exist?
            LAb4   LAb
That's when I make the wish
                            LAb4
To swim away with the fish
   LAb                        LAb4    LAb     LAb4
Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
DOm              REb
I never would've believed you
               DOm
If three years ago you told me
    REb                 FAm   SIbm7
I'd be here writing this song
           LAb  DOm7
But here I am
        FAm   SIbm7
Next to you
          LAb     DOm7
The sky's so blue
    FAm    SIbm7
In Malibu
        LAb  DOm7
Next to you
    FAm   SIbm7
In Malibu
        LAb  DOm7
Next to you, baby

FAm  SIbm7  LAb  DOm7

Next to you
          LAb     DOm7
The sky's so blue

In Malibu, baby
        LAb  DOm7
Next to you

LAb                            LAb4        LAb     LAb4
We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
LAb                         LAb4
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning 
                    LAb
and you're there to save me
             LAb4                  LAb       
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
       LAb4   LAb
It's a brand new start
   LAb4   LAb
A dream come true
LAb4 LAb    LAb4 LAb
In Malibu
