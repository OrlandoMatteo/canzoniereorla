
  MI
I probably shouldn't say this
       MI/RE#
But at times I get so scared
       DO#m7
When I think about the previous
  SI4
Relationship we've shared
       LAadd9
It was awesome

But we lost it
         SI4
It's not possible
              DO#m7
For me not to care
    SI        LAadd9
And now we're standing in the rain
              SI4
But nothing's ever gonna change
          DO#m7/4
Until you hear   ...My dear

                          MI  MI/RE# DO#m7
The 7 things I hate about you
    SI                 LAadd9     SI4
The 7 things I hate about you (oh you)
MI              SI/RE#                DO#m7
 You're vain, your games, you're insecure
             SI 
You love me, you like her
    LAadd9  
You make me laugh, you make me cry
  SI    
I don't know which side to buy
MI                    MI/RE#  
 Your friends they're jerks
                  DO#m7  
When you act like them
             SI4
Just know it hurts
  LAadd9                  SI
I wanna be with the one I know
        MI/SOL#     LAadd9                 SI4
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do
                 MI
You make me love you

     MI
It's awkward and silent
     MI/RE#
As I wait for you to say
    DO#m7
But what I need to hear now
        SI4
Is your sincere apology
         LAadd9
When you mean it  I'll believe it
       SI4
If you text it I'll delete it
         DO#m7/9
Let's be clear
           LAadd9
Oh I'm not coming back
       SI4          DO#m7/9
You're taking 7 steps here

                          MI  
The 7 things I hate about you
               SI/RE#                DO#m7
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
             SI 
You love me, you like her
    LAadd9  
You make me laugh, you make me cry
  SI    
I don't know which side to buy
MI                    MI/RE#  
 Your friends they're jerks
                  DO#m7  
When you act like them
             SI4
Just know it hurts
  LAadd9                  SI
I wanna be with the one I know
        MI/SOL#     LAadd9                 SI4
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do
                 MI
You make me love you

    MI
And compared to all the great things
           SI/RE#
That would take too long to write
  DO#m7
I probably should mention
    SI4
The 7 that I like

                          MI
The 7 things I like about you
              MI/RE#              DO#m7
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
                 SI4
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
    LAadd9
You make me laugh, you make me cry
      SI
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy
MI          MI/RE#
 Your hand in mine
                 DO#m7
When we're intertwined
               SI4
Everything's alright
  LAadd9                    SI              
I want to be with the one I know
        MI/SOL#     LAadd9                 SI
And the 7th thing I like the most that you do
                 MI   
You make me love you
          LAadd9  SI4  DO#m7   
You do...

LAadd9  SI4  DO#m11
