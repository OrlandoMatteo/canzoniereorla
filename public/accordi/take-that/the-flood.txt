Standing
                 SOL
On the edge of forever
                   SIm
At the start of whatever

Shouting love at the world

Back then
            SOL
We were like cavemen
                  SIm
But we mapped the moon and the stars
           FA#m
Then we forgave them
MIm              SOL
 We will meet you  where the lights are
SIm           FA#m
 The defenders  of the faith we are
MIm         
When the thunder turns around
        SOL                                SIm
They'll run so hard we'll tear the ground away

You know no one   dies

In these love-drowned eyes
            SOL6         SI
Through our love-drowned eyes

We'll watch you sleep tonight

SOL                  RE
Although no one understood,

we were holding back the flood
                        FA#m
Learning how to dance the rain

They said we'd never dance again

RE
Bleeding
              SOL
But none of us leaving
             SIm
Watch your mouth, son
                        FA#m
Or you'll find yourself floating home
MIm              SOL
 Here we come now  on a dark star
SIm           FA#m
 Seeing demons,  not what we are
MIm
Tiny minds and eager hands
     SOL                              SIm
Will try to strike but now will end today

There's progress now

Where there once was none

Where there once was, ah

Then everything came along
