Coming to you

And I can find a faith
   REb
In days I've wasted

Been around enough to feel alive

And when the world is broken,
REb
Hard and cold,
    SIbm                         LAb
And no one ever knows the reason why
        SOLb
For the ones we may become
        REb
For the battles we have won
        SIbm

What a day to belong to a face in the crowd
LAb                  SOLb
And the beat of your heart
REb               SIbm
