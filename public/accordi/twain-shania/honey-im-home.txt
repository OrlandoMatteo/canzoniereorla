MI5

    MI5
The car won't start

It's falling apart

I was late for work and the boss got smart

My panty line shows

Got a run in my hose

My hair went flat

Man, I hate that (Hate that)
         MI5
Oh, just when I thought things couldn't get worse

I realized I forgot my purse

With all this stress

I must confess

This could be worse than PMS
LA
 This job ain't worth the pay

Can't wait 'til the end of the day
SI
 Hey honey, I'm on my way

Hey (Hey) Hey (Hey) Hey, hey, hey

MI           
Honey, I'm home and I had a hard day
                    
Pour me a cold one and oh, by the way
SI
Rub my feet
                
Give me something to eat

Fix me up my favorite treat
MI
Honey, I'm back, my head's killing me

I need to relax and watch TV
    SI
Get off the phone

Give the dog a bone
                      MI
Hey (Hey) Hey Honey, I'm home

I broke a nail

Opening the mail

I cursed out loud 'cause it hurt like hell

This job's a pain it's so mundane

It sure don't stimulate my brain
