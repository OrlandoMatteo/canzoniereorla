             MIb      SOLm7  FA
I'm not always strong
        SIb/RE     MIb    SOLm  FA
And sometimes I'm even wrong
      REm7       MIb
But I win when I choose
                     FA
And I can't stand to lose
               MIbadd9  SOLm7  FA
But I can't always be
    SIb/RE     MIbadd9  SOLm7  FA
The rock that you see
         SIb/RE         MIb
When the nights get too long
                    FA
And I just can't go on

    SIb DOm7 SIb/RE MIbadd9
The wo--man  in     me
            SIb
Needs you to be
              SOLm
The man in my arms
              FA   SIb/FA FA
To hold tenderly
             SIb FA  SIb MIbadd9
'Cause I'm a wo--man in  love
                SOLm
And it's you I run to
          DOm7  MIb  FA
Yeah, the woman   in me
                 SIb  SIb/RE FA
Needs the man in you

                       MIbadd9  SOLm  FA
When the world wants too much
             SIb/RE      MIb     SOLm  FA
And it feels cold and out of touch
       REm7      MIb
It's a beautiful place
                 FA
When you kiss my face

    SIb DOm7 SIb/RE MIbadd9
The wo--man  in     me
            SIb
Needs you to be
              SOLm
The man in my arms
              FA   SIb/FA FA
To hold tenderly
             SIb FA  SIb MIbadd9
'Cause I'm a wo--man in  love
                SOLm
And it's you I run to
          DOm7  MIb  FA
Yeah, the woman   in me
                   SIb  SIb/RE FA
Needs the man in you...
