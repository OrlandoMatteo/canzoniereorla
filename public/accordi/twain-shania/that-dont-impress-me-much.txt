I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart
    SIbm             SOLb  REb        LAb
But you've got being right down to an art
    SIbm           SOLb                REb     LAb
You think you're a genius, you drive me up the wall
         SIbm     SOLb      REb      LAb
You're a regular original, a know-it-all


MIb   SIb     LAb
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're special
MIb   SIb                  LAb
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're something else
                      
OK, so you're a rocket scientist


             SOLb     REb  LAb SIbm
That don't impress me much
      SOLb     REb              LAb       SIbm
So you got the brain but have you got the touch?
          SOLb    REb           LAb            SIbm
Now don't get me wrong, yeah, I think you're alright
    SOLb               REb         LAb  
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night

I never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket
      SIbm        SOLb   REb      LAb
And a comb up his sleeve  just in case
             SIbm       SOLb        REb          LAb
And all that extra-hold gel in your hair oughtta lock it
   SIbm          SOLb          REb        LAb
'Cause Heaven forbid it should fall outta place


MIb   SIb     LAb
Oh-oo-oh, you think you're special
MIb   SIb                  LAb

You're one of those guys who likes to shine his machine
            SIbm        SOLb             REb        LAb
You make me take off my shoes before you let me get in
SIbm      SOLb               REb       LAb
I can't believe you kiss your car good night
     SIbm         SOLb     REb          LAb
