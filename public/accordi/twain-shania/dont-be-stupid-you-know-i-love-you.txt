RE                
You're so complicated, 
                   
you hang over my shoulder
 
When I read my mail
         
I don't appreciate it
             
When I talk to other guys

You think they're on my tail
SOL RE
 I  get so aggravated when I get off the phone

And I get the third degree

I'm really feelin' frustrated

Why don't you take a pill

And put a little trust in me
           RE  SOL
And you'll see
                                   RE   SOL
Don't freak out until you know the facts
  LA
Relax

RE

SOL  RE
    Stop overreacting

You even get suspicious 

when I paint my nails

It's definitely distracting

The way you dramatize 
                         RE  SOL  RE         
every little small detail
                                        SOL
Don't freak out until you know the facts
   LA
Relax, Max
