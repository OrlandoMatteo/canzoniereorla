  REb                REb/DO SIbm7                LAb4
A farmer and a teacher,   a hooker and a preacher,
SOLb                     REb           LAb
Ridin' on a midnight bus bound for Mexico
       REb               REb/DO    SIbm7
One's headed for vacation, one for higher education,
    SOLb             LAb              REb
An' two of them were searchin' for lost souls
     MIbm7                     LAb
That driver never ever saw the stop sign
    MIbm7                              LAb4 LAb
An' eighteen wheelers can't stop on a dime

         REb           REb/DO
There are three wooden crosses 
       SIbm7             REb/LAb  SOLb
on the right side of the highway,
                              REb         LAb
Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows
            REb           REb/DO
I guess it's not what you take 
         SIbm7              LAb4
when you leave this world behind you,
     SOLb             LAb                REb
It's what you leave behind you when you go

     REb                  REb/DO
That farmer left a harvest, 
  SIbm7     
a home and eighty acres,
    SOLb                 
The faith an' love for growin' things 
REb                LAb
in his young son's heart
         REb                    REb/DO
An' that teacher left her wisdom 
       SIbm7                    
in the minds of lots of children:
        SOLb              LAb          REb
Did her best to give 'em all a better start
         MIbm7
An' that preacher whispered: 
                   LAb
"Can't you see the Promised Land?"
               MIbm7                               
As he laid his blood-stained bible 
                 LAb4  LAb
in that hooker's hand

         REb           REb/DO

                              REb         LAb

            REb           REb/DO
I guess it's not what you take 
         SIbm7              LAb4
when you leave this world behind you,
     SOLb             LAb                REb
It's what you leave behind you when you go

           SIbm            LAb            SOLb
That's the story that our preacher told last Sunday
      REb
As he held that blood-stained bible up,
    LAb
For all of us to see
                    SIbm
He said: "Bless the farmer, 
        LAb              SOLb
and the teacher, an' the preacher
               MIbm7
"Who gave this Bible to my mamma,
     LAb
"Who read it to me"

I guess it's not what you take 
         SIbm7              LAb4
when you leave this world behind you,
     SOLb             LAb                REb
