 There was a time
        LA5
Looking through myself
MI5          FA#5
Wanted to pretend

If I escaped
        LA5
I could feel myself
MI5               FA#5
I don't think you can

Been far and wide
         LA5
But that hole inside
MI5          FA#5
Never really leaves

I went away
      LA5 
But I really lost
MI5             SI5 LA5 RE5 DO#5 MI5
Left behind was me

Install in me

Clear me on      my       way  
           FA#5
Ohhhhhhhh...

        LA5

FA#5
 Each passing day
      LA5
Every passing face
MI5               FA#5
Seems like such a gloom

I long to be
     LA5
Home silently
MI5           FA#5
Lying next to her

Just to get back
       LA5
By her side is all,
MI5           FA#5
All I need to be I went away
       LA5
What I really lost
MI5             SI5 LA5 RE5 DO#5 MI5
Left behind was me

I need to be
        SI5 LA5 RE5 DO#5 MI5
Getting on      my       way
            FA#5
