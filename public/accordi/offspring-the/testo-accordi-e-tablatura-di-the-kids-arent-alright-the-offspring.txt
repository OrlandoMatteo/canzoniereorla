 When we were young the future was so bright (whoa)
                                    REb
The old neighborhood was so alive (whoa)
                                         LAb
And every kid on the whole damn street (whoa)

was gonna make it big in every beat.

 Now the neighborhood's cracked and torn (whoa)
                                                REb
The kids are grown up but their lives are worn(whoa)

How can one little street
LAb
Swallow so many lives?

Fragile lives, shattered dreams

Go!
