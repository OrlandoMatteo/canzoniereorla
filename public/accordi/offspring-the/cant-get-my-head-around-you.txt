
Intro:
FA5

FA5              LAb             MIb5
Deep inside your soul, there's a hole
          SIb5
You don't want to see
FA5          LAb           MIb5
Every single day, what you say
         SIb5
Makes no sense to me
FA5           LAb5
Even though I try
  MIb5         SIb5        FA5  LAb5  MIb5  SIb5
I can't get my head around you
FA5              LAb5             MIb5
Somewhere in the night, there's a light
   SIb5
In front of me
FA5        LAb5         MIb5
Heaven up above, with a shove
 SIb5
Abandons me
    FA5           LAb5
And even though I try
  MIb5        SIb5     FA5  LAb5
I fall in the river of you
    MIb5      SIb5          REb5
You manage to bring me down too

REb5            FA5
All your faking
REb                 MIb5  DO5
Shows you're aching

FA5          LAb5          MIb5
Every single day, what you say
         SIb5
Makes no sense to me
FA5           LAb5       MIb5
Letting you inside isn't right
              SIb5
'Cause you'll mess with me
  FA5          LAb5
I never really know
       MIb5       SIb5     FA5  LAb5     
What's really going inside you
  REb5         SIb5        FA5  LAb5  MIb5  SIb5
I can't get my head around you

FA5  LAb5  MIb5  SIb5  FA5  LAb5  MIb5  SIb5

FA5  LAb5  MIb5  SIb5  FA5

REb5              FA5   
All your feeding...
REb5                   MIb5  DO5
Shows you're bleeding...

FA5              LAb5            MIb5
Deep inside your soul, there's a hole
          SIb5
You don't want to see
       FA5         LAb5       MIb5
You're covering it up, like a cut
         SIb5
With the likes of me
    FA5              LAb5
You know I've really tried
  MIb5        SIb5       FA5
I can't do anymore about you

FA5  LAb5
Yeah...
    MIb5          SIb5
The cut's getting deeper
FA5  LAb5
Yeah...
    MIb5           SIb5
The hill's getting steeper
  FA5              LAb5
I guess I'll never know
       MIb5         SIb5      FA5  LAb5 
What's really going on inside you
  REb5         SIb5        FA5  LAb5
I can't get my head around you
  MIb5         SIb5        FA5  LAb5
I can't get my head around you
  MIb5         SIb5        FA5  LAb5
I can't get my head around you
  MIb5         SIb5        FA5  
I can't get my head around you
