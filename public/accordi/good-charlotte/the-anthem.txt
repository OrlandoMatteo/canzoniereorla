       REb
It's a new day
       LAb
But it all feels old
       REb
It's a good life
       SOLb
That's what I'm told
    REb            LAb                SOLb
But everything, it all just feels the same
   REb
At my high school
        LAb
It felt more to me
       REb
Like a jail cell
      SOLb
A penitentiary
   REb                 LAb           SOLb
My time spent there, it only made me see
     SIbm               SOLb
That I don't ever wanna be like you
REb               
I don't wanna do the things you do
    SIbm                 SOLb
I'm never gonna hear the words you say
    LAb
And I don't ever wanna

                      REb LAb SOLb
I don't ever wanna be yo--u
LAb            REb       LAb SOLb

Throw all your hands up yo--u
               REb    LAb    SOLb    LAb
Don't wanna be you

      REb
Go to college
      LAb
Or university
      REb
Get a real job
                 SOLb
That's what they said to me
    REb           LAb               SOLb
But I could never live the way they want
          REb
I'm gonna get by
         LAb
And just do my time
      REb
Outta step while
         SOLb
They all get in line
    REb          LAb               SOLb
I'm just a minor threat, so pay no mind
SIbm                SOLb
Do you really wanna be like them?
       REb
Do you really wanna be another trend?
SIbm                 SOLb
Do you wanna be part of that crowd?
       LAb
'Cause I don't ever wanna

You shake it once, that's fine
             LAb
You shake it twice, that's okay
SIbm          REb
 You shake it three times
       LAb                    REb LAb REb SOLb
