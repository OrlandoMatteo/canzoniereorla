Hope so much your race will be all run
SIb6              REm
 Then you find you jumped the gun
SIb6            REm
 Have to go back where you began

 When the game's been fought
                  SOL/SI            SIb6
You speed the ball across the court
                        REm
Lost much sooner than you would have thought
SIb6     SIb7    LA7/4      LA7
 Now the game's been fought

 When the party's through
             SOL/SI        SIb6
Seems so very sad for you
                  REm                 SIb7
Didn't do the things you meant to do
                    REm
Now there's no time to start anew
SIb6     LA7/4 LA7 REm
 Now the party's   through

When the day is done
               SOL/SI            SIb6
Down to earth then sinks the sun
                      REm
Along with everything that was lost and won

  When the day    is done
