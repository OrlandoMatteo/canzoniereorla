 Say my name, say my name
              FAm
If no one is around you
           LAb/SIb
Say baby I love you
   SOL7/SI           DOm
If you ain't runnin' game
                    LAb
Say my name, say my name
                 FAm7
You actin' kinda shady
                 SIb11
Ain't callin' me baby
SOL7/SI        DOm
Why the sudden change
                    LAb
Say my name, say my name
              FAm

                 SIb11
Ain't callin' me baby
SOL7/SI       DOm
Better say my name

DOm
Any other day
        LAb
I would call and you would say
FAm
Baby how's your day
      LAb/SIb           SOL7/SI
But today, it ain't the same
DOm
Every other word
       LAb
Is "uh-huh" yeah "okay"
FAm7
Could it be that you
           LAb/SIb             SOL7/SI
Are at the crib with another lady
DOm
If you took it there
         LAb
First of all, let me say
FAm7
I am not the one
        LAb/SIb       SOL7/SI
To sit around, and be played
   DOm
So prove yourself to me
         LAb
I am the girl that you claim
    FAm
Why don't you say the thangs
         LAb/SIb          SOL7/SI
That you said to me yesterday
  DOm                       
I know you say that I am assuming things
LAb          
Something's going down that's the way it seems
FAm                       
Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange
   LAb/SIb              SOL7/SI
If nobody's holding you back from me
       DOm
'Cause I know how you usually do
         LAb
When you say everything to me times two
FAm7
Why can't you just tell the truth
   LAb/SIb               SOL7/SI
If somebody's there then tell me who

DOm                  LAb
 Say my name, say my name
              FAm
If no one is around you
           LAb/SIb
Say baby I love you
   SOL7/SI           DOm
If you ain't runnin' game
                    LAb
Say my name, say my name
                 FAm7
You actin' kinda shady
                 SIb11
Ain't callin' me baby
SOL7/SI        DOm
Why the sudden change
                    LAb
Say my name, say my name
              FAm

DOm
What is up with this
         LAb
Tell the truth, who you with
    FAm
How would you like it if
       LAb/SIb      SOL7/SI
I came over with my clique
      DOm
Don't try to change it now
    LAb
See you gotta bounce
     FAm
When two seconds ago
         LAb/SIb             SOL7/SI
You said you just got in the house
     DOm
It's hard to believe that you
       LAb
Are at home, by yourself
     FAm
When I just heard the voice
          LAb/SIb          SOL7/SI
Heard the voice of someone else
DOm
Just this question why
       LAb
Do you feel you gotta lie
        FAm
Gettin' caught up in your game
         LAb/SIb        SOL7/SI
When you can not say my name
  DOm
I know you say that I am assuming things
LAb
Something's going down that's the way it seems
FAm
Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange
   LAb/SIb              SOL7/SI
If nobody's holding you back from me
