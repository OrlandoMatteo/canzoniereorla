 Uh huh  ...It's Iggy Iggs
                                 
I got one more problem with you girl

(One less, one less problem)

SOLb7+                       LAb
 Hey baby even though I hate ya
        REb
I wanna love ya (I want you)
SOLb7+                           LAb
 And even though I can't forgive you
         SIbm
I really want ya (I want you)
SOLb7+            LAb
Tell me, tell me baby
REb
 Why can't you leave me?
SOLb7+                              LAb
 Cause even though I shouldn't want it
        SIbm
I gotta have it (I want you)
SOLb7+
Head in the clouds
LAb     REb
 Got no weight on my shoulders
SOLb7+        LAb
I should be wiser
    SIbm
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya

I got one less problem without ya

I got one less problem without ya

I got one less, one less problem
SIbm
One less problem without ya

I got one less problem without ya

I got one less problem without ya

I got one less, one less problem

SOLb7+                          LAb
 I know you're never gonna wake up
        REb
I gotta give up (But it's you)
SOLb7+                        LAb
 I know I shouldn't ever call back
           SIbm
Or let you come back (But it's you)
SOLb7+             LAb
Every time you touch me
REb 
 And say you love me
SOLb7+                    LAb
 I get a little bit breathless
            SIbm
I shouldn't want it (But it's you)
SOLb7+
Head in the clouds
LAb    REb
Got no weight on my shoulders
SOLb7+        LAb
I should be wiser
    SIbm
And realize that I've got

One less problem without ya

I got one less problem without ya

I got one less problem without ya

I got one less, one less problem
SIbm
One less problem without ya

I got one less problem without ya 

I got one less problem without ya 

I got one less, one less problem
SIbm             
 It's Iggy Iggs  ...Uh, what you got?

Smart money bettin'

I'll be better off without you

In no time, I'll be forgettin' all about you

You saying that you know

But I really, really doubt you

Understand my life is easy when I ain't around you
SIbm
 Iggy Iggy

To biggie to be here stressin'

I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you

More than I love your presence

And the best thing now is probably for you to exit

I let you go, let you back

I finally learned my lesson

No half-steppin'

Either you want it, or you just playin'

I'm listening to you knowin'

I can't believe what you're sayin'

There's a million you's baby boo, so don't be dumb

I got 99 problems, but you won't be one
       SOLb7+    LAb REb
Like what
                          SOLb7+   LAb 
One less, one less problem
SIbm
One less, one less problem

SOLb7+ 
Head in the clouds
LAb    REb
Got no weight on my shoulders
SOLb7+        LAb
I should be wiser
    SIbm
And realize that I've got (I've got)

One less problem without ya

I got one less problem without ya

I got one less problem without ya

I got one less, one less problem
SIbm
One less problem without ya

I got one less problem without ya

I got one less problem without ya

I got one less, one less problem

One less problem without ya

I got one less problem without ya

I got one less problem without ya

I got one less, one less problem
