Take my message to your brother and tell him twice
                        
Spread the word and try to teach the man
      SIm7       MI            FA#

Sing out loud

Touch a hand and sing a sound so pure,

Every breath you take

Is someone's death in another place

Every healthy smile

Is hunger and strife to another child
        
But the stars do shine
 
In promising salvation, is near this time

Can you feel it now

So brothers and sisters

Show we know how ...Now tell me
