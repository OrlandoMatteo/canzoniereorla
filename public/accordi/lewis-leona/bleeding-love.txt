
FA                                        REm7
 Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
                                            SIb7+
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
                            
Time starts to pass, before you know it, 
       DO          FA
you're frozen, ooh
          
But something happened 
                               REm7
for the very first time with you

My heart melts into the ground, 
                  SIb
found something true

And everyone's looking 'round, 
                    DO
thinking I'm going crazy, oh

FA
 But I don't care what they say
                    REm7
I'm in love with you

They try to pull me away, 
                             SIb
but they don't know the truth

My heart's crippled by the vein 
               DO
that I keep on closing
                     FA
You cut me open and I
                                    REm7
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
                                        SIb
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
                                    DO
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
               FA
You cut me open   ...Oh yeah

FA                                           REm7
 Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud

Their piercing sounds fill my ears, 
                      SIb7+
try to fill me with doubt

Yet I know that their goal 
                    DO
is to keep me from falling, hey, oh
FA
 But nothing's greater than the rush 
                         REm7
that comes with your embrace
                                            SIbadd9
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
                                             DO
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy

Maybe, maybe

FA
 But I don't care what they say
                   REm7
I'm in love with you

They try to pull me away, 
                           SIb
but they don't know the truth

My heart's crippled by the vein 
                DO
that I keep on closing
                     FA
You cut me open and I
                                    REm7
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
                                        SIb
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
                                    DO
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
                REm
You cut me open

                          SIb
And it's draining all of me
                               FA/DO
Though they find it hard to believe
                                DO
I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see
REm
 I don't care what they say
                   SIb
I'm in love with you
                    
They try to pull me away, 
                         DO
but they don't know the truth

My heart's crippled by the vein 
               
that I keep on closing
                         REm
Oh, you cut me open and I
                                     SIbadd9
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love

Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
