We're so glad to see so many of you lovely
people here tonight and we would especially
like to welcome all the representatives of
Illinois law enforcement community who have
chosen to join us here in the Palace Hotel
ballroom at this time. We do sincerely
hope you'll all enjoy the show and please
remember people, that no matter who you are
and what you do to live, thrive and survive,
there're still some things that make
us all the same.
You, me, them, everybody, everybody!

You know people when you do find that somebody
Hold that woman, hold that man
Love him, hold him, squeeze her
please her, hold her
Squeeze and please that person
give em all your love
Signify your feelings
with every gentle caress
Because its so important
to have that special somebody
To hold, kiss, miss, squeeze and please
