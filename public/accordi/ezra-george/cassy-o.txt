Yeah, I'd better change my ways

Oh, maybe I'm wasting

Maybe I'm chasing time

Oh, come on, let's face it
    SOL       LA      RE
I'm only ever lost in mine
        SOL            LA
Well, I got my tracing paper
        SOL              LA
So that I could trace my clock

I was ripping out the battery

I received myself a shock
       SOL           LA
And to add insult to injury

I could still hear tick & tock

And I traveled there by train
     SOL                   LA    
This something might sound strange to you
           RE
But on the way I gained a day

And I wrote to tell my family
      SOL              LA
And I wrote to tell my friends

Inspector, fix me, my Cassy O's burnt out

We're losing memories that I can't replace

She says she's tired of me running in circles

She says it's time that we took a break
