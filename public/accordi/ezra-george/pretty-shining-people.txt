REb
                                            
Me and Sam in the car, talking 'bout America
SIbm
Heading to the wishing well, 
      LAb 
we've reached our last resort
REb
 I turned to him said: "Man help me out
  SIbm                        LAb 
I fear I'm on an island in an ocean full of change
      SIbm
Can't bring myself to dive 
         LAb
in to an ocean full of change
     REb
Am I losing touch?
     LAb               
Am I losing touch now?"
        REb               SIbm                 LAb
He said: "Why why, what a terrible time to be alive
                                    REb
If you're prone to over thinking and
                SIbm                 LAb
Why why, what a terrible time to be alive
                                   
If you're prone to second guessing"

REb                 LAb           SOLb
Hey pretty smiling people, we're alright together
                  
We're alright together
REb                 LAb           SOLb
Hey pretty shining people, we're alright together
                           REb
We're alright together, he-ey

REb                                         
 Took it in turns to dream about the lottery
    SIbm
And what we might have done
          LAb 
If we had entered and had won
REb
 We're each convinced 
                          
that nothing would have changed
    SIbm
But if this were the case
            LAb
Why is it a conversation anyways?
       REb
Are we losing touch?
       LAb           
Are we losing touch now?
        REb               SIbm                 LAb
