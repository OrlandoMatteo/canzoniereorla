 And you said, call me back at eight
LAb      FAm            LAb/DO            REb
 I don't care, that you left me there for hours

LAb             FAm 
 Too proud for love, he tells me

 Too hurt to give it one more shot
                FAm            DOm
Don't drawl me in, he warns me

But now it's too late to give up
         FAm         LAb/DO                 REb
So don't say, you'll leave your keys on the counter
