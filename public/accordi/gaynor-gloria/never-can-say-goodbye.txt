FA7+                 SOL7/4
 I never can say goodbye
              FA7+
No, no, no, I
                     SOL7/4  SOL
I never can say goodbye
      DO7+                  
Every time I think I've had enough
          DOm7
And start heading for the door
          DO7+
There's a very strange vibration
         DOm7
Piercing me right to the core
          DO7+
It says, "Turn around, you fool
             DOm7              DO9
You know you love him more and more"
        FA7+   MIm7 REm7   FA6/SOL
Tell me why is it  so?
                    DO
Don't wanna let you go!

                         DOm7         DOm6+       
Hey, I never can say goodbye boy, ooh baby
  LAb/DO            DO                
I never can say goodbye, no, no, no... hey
                         DOm7         DOm6+       
Hey, I never can say goodbye boy, ooh baby

       DO7+
I keep thinking that our problems
         DOm7
Soon are all gonna work out
                 DO7+
But there's that same unhappy feeling
                 DOm7
And there's that anguish, there's that doubt
          DO7+
It's that same old dizzy hang-up
           DOm7           DO9
I can't do with you or without
        FA7+   MIm7 REm7
Tell me why is it  so?
  FA6/SOL              DO
