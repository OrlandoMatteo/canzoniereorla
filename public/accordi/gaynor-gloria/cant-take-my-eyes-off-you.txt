You're just too good to be true
              SIb7+
Can't take my eyes off of you
              SIb7
You'd be like heaven to touch
        MIb
I wanna hold you so much
             MIbm
At long last love has arrived
            SIb
And I thank God I'm alive
                DO/SIb           DOm/SIb
You're just too good to be true
              SIb
Can't take my eyes off of you

Pardon the way that I stare
                SIb7+
There's nothing else to compare
                 SIb7
The sight of you leaves me weak
             MIb    
There are no words left to speak
          MIbm
So if you feel like I feel
              SIb
Please let me know that it's real

You're just too good to be true
              SIb
Can't take my eyes off of you
