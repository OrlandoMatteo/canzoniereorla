Putting my defenses up
       FAm                   SIbm7/9
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
   LAb
If I ever did that, 

I think I'd have a heart attack

REb                LAb          MIb
 Never put my love out on the line
               FAm            REb
Never said yes to the right guy
                  LAb             MIb
Never had trouble getting what I want
                              FAm          REb
But when it comes to you, I'm never good enough
       LAb    MIb                 FAm         REb
When I don't care, I can play 'em like a Ken doll
           LAb  MIb
Won't wash my hair, 
                     FAm           REb
then make 'em bounce like a basketball
                LAb              MIb  
But you make me wanna act like a girl
               FAm           REb
Paint my nails and wear high heels
                 LAb
Yes, you make me so nervous 
       MIb
that I just can't hold your hand

            REb   LAb  MIb
You make me glo----------w
                FAm          REb   LAb  MIb
But I cover up, won't let it sho---------w
       REb                  DOm

Never break a sweat for the other guys
                        FAm       REb
When you come around, I get paralyzed
                     LAb      MIb
And every time I try to be myself
                   FAm            REb
It comes out wrong like a cry for help
          LAb  MIb
It's just not fair; 
                    FAm          REb
pain's more trouble than love is worth
       LAb  MIb              
I gasp for air; it feels so good, 
FAm             REb
but you know it hurts
                LAb              MIb
But you make me wanna act like a girl
             FAm           REb
Paint my nails and wear perfume for you
     LAb                  DO7
Make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand

                 REb
The feelings got lost in my lungs

They're burning; 
    LAb     
I'd rather be numb (rather be numb)
            MIb            FAm
And there's no one else to blame 

(no one else to blame)
                  REb
So scared, I take off, and I run
               LAb
I'm flying too close to the sun
                 DO7
And I burst into fla-fla-flames

            REb   LAb  MIb
