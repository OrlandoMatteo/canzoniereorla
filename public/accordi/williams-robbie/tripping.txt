 First they ignore you
     LAm                       REm
Then laugh at you and hate you
LAm
 Then they flight you
REm      LAm     REm LAm
Then you win
                   REm
When the truth dies
LAm                   REm LAm
Very bad things happen
                       REm       
They're being heartless
 LAm     REm
Again

 I know, its gonna, there's gonna be violence

 I've taken as much as I'm willing to take

 Why do you think we should suffer in silence

 When a hearth is broken there's nothing to break

 You've been mixing
REm        LAm             REm LAm
 With some very heavy faces
        
They boys have done
  REm    LAm    REm LAm
A bit of bird
                         REm
They don't kill their own 
         LAm                 REm LAm
And they all love their mothers
                                
But you're out of your depth son
REm    LAm
Have a word

When you think we're lost, we're exploring

What you think is work because I'm adoring

You don't want the truth, truth is boring

I've got this fever need to

Leave the house leave the car

Leave the bad men where they are

I'll leave a few shells in my gun
                            FA
And stop me starring at the sun...
