SIb   DOm7          SIb/RE   
 Well there's three versions 
                       MIb
of this story mine and yours
    SIb/RE DOm7
And then the truth
SIb  DOm7   SIb/RE 
 Now we can put it down to circumstance, 
    MIb  SIb/RE     DO7
our childhood, then our youth
FA7                      SOLm
 Out of some sentimental gain 
                        MIb
I wanted you to feel my pain,
                           SIb DOm7 SIb/RE
But it came back return to sender
FA7                            SOLm
 I read your mind and tried to call,
                               MIb
My tears could fill the Albert Hall,
                             FA
Is this the sound of sweet surrender?

                SIb   DOm7    MIbadd9
What a shame we never listened
  FA                   SIb DOm7 MIbadd9            
I told you through the television
    FA             SIb         DOm7     MIbadd9
And all that went away was the price we paid
FA             SOLm          DO7
People spend a lifetime this way
          FA7
Oh what a shame

SIb DOm7  SIb/RE
 So I got busy throwing everybody 
MIb   SIb/RE   DOm7
underneath the bus, oh
SIb  DOm7      SIb/RE
 And with your poster 30 foot high 
       MIb     SIb/RE DO7
at the back of Toys-R-Us
FA7                     SOLm
 I wrote a letter in my mind,
                        MIb
But the words were so unkind,
                      SIb DOm7 SIb/RE
About a man I can't remember
FA7                         SOLm
 I don't recall the reasons why,
                              MIb
I must have meant them at the time
                             FA
Is this the sound of sweet surrender?

                SIb   DOm7    MIbadd9
What a shame we never listened
  FA                   SIb DOm7 MIbadd9            
I told you through the television
    FA             SIb         DOm7     MIbadd9
And all that went away was the price we paid
FA             SOLm          DO7
People spend a lifetime this way
    SOLm            DO7
And that's how they stay
          FA7
Oh what a shame

SIb   SOL7 DO7
Words come easy
DOm7 FA7     SIb
When they're true
      SOL7 DO7
Words come easy
DOm7 FA7     SIb
When they're true
SIb       DOm7          MIbadd9   FA             SIb
 So I got busy throwing everybody underneath the bus
              DOm7      MIbadd9 
And with your poster 30 foot high 
       FA             SIb
at the back of Toys-R-Us
           DOm7           MIbadd9

               SOLm          DO7
People spend a lifetime this way
          FA7
Oh what a shame
       SIb DOm7 SIb/RE
What a shame
MIb SIb/RE DO7
Ooh...
DOm7                SIb
Such a shame what a shame

Beautiful shame, real shame, 

and stuff double shame (shame, shame shame)
