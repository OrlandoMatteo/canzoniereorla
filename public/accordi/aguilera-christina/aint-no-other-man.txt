 Do your thang honey!
                               SIb FAm
I could feel it from the start
                           SIb FAm
Couldn't stand to be apart
                                  SIb FAm
Something about you caught my eye
                                 REb7 DO7
Something moved me deep inside!
                                               SIb FAm
I don't know what you did, boy, but you had it

And I've been hooked ever since
                                             
Told my mother, my brother, 
                 SIb     FAm
my sister and my friends
                                                 
Told the others, my lovers, 
                      SIb   FAm
both past and present tense

Alright
                                              SIb  FAm
Every time I see you everything starts making sense

Do your thang honey!
FAm                                     SIb FAm
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
                                               SIb FAm
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do

(what you do)
                                            SIb FAm
You're the kinda guy a girl finds in a blue moon

You got soul, you got class
                        REb7  DO7
You got style, you're badass

Ain't no other man it's true

Alright
SIb      FAm
Ain't no other man but you

FAm
 Never thought I'd be all right
SIb     FAm
No, no, no!
                                  SIb FAm
'Til you came and changed my life
                             SIb FAm
What was cloudy now is clear!
                               REb7 DO7
You're the light that I needed
                                         SIb FAm
You got what I want, boy, and I want it!

So keep on givin' it up!

              FAm
So, tell your mother, your brother, 
                      SIb     FAm
your sister, and your friends

And the others, your lovers, 
                      SIb    FAm
better not be present tense

'Cause I want everyone to know 
                      SIb    FAm
that you are mine and no one else's!

FAm                                     SIb  FAm
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you

Ain't no other man on the planet 
              SIb   FAm
does what you do (what you do)

Ain't no other man but you

Break it down now!
FAm
 Ain't no other, ain't, ain't no other-other

Ain't no other, ain't, ain't no other lover!

Ain't no other, I, I, I need no other!
                                  REb7 DO7
Ain't no other man but you, boy!
                               REb7 DO7       
You are there when I'm a mess
                               REb7 DO7
Talk me down from every ledge
                                       REb7 DO7
Give me strength, boy, you're the best
                                            SIb  FAm
