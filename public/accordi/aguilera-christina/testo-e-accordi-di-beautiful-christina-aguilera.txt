         FA
I'm down a one way street
       SOL/FA
With a one night stand
       FA
With a one track mind
       SOL/FA
Out in no man's land
MI4                                
 The punishment sometimes
           MIm
Don't seem to fit the crime
               FA
Yeah there's a hole in my soul
     SOL/FA
But one thing I've learned
          FA
For every love letter written
         SOL/FA             MI4
There's another one burned
                              MIm
