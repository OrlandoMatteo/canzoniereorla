I am done, smoking gun
      FA               DO           MI7
We've lost it all, the love is gone
LAm              MIm
She has won, now it's no fun
      FA               DO           
We've lost it all, the love is gone
                 SOL/SI
And we had magic
                  MI7
And this is tragic
                       FA
You couldn't keep your hands to yourself

DO     MI7                      FA   FAm
 I feel like our world's been infected
DO        MI7              FA    FAm
 And somehow you left me neglected
DO       MI7             LAm     FAm/LAb
 We've found our lives been changed
FA     FAm         DO
Babe,  ...you lost me

LAm             MIm           
And we tried, oh how we cried
   FA                  DO            MI7
We lost ourselves, the love has died
 LAm                    MIm
And though we tried you can't deny
      FA                 DO       
We're left as shells, we lost the fight
               SOL
And we had magic
                 MI7/SOL#
And this is tragic
                       FA            
You couldn't keep your hands to yourself

DO     MI7                      FA   FAm
 I feel like our world's been infected
DO        MI7              FA    FAm
 And somehow you left me neglected
DO       MI7             LAm     FAm/LAb
 We've found our lives been changed
FA    FAm            LAm
Babe,  ...you lost me
                     RE7             LAm
Now I know you're sorry and we were sweet
                   RE7                SOL
But you chose lust when you deceived me
                   MI7/SOL#         FA
And you'll regret it, but it's too late
                            DO
How can I ever trust you again?

I feel like our world's been infected
DO        MI7              FA    FAm
 And somehow you left me neglected
DO       MI7             LAm     FAm/LAb
 We've found our lives been changed
FA     FAm            DO
Babe,  ...you lost me
