You know it's not the norm
                                             
'Cause I'm doing things that I normally won't do

And if you don't like it, fuck you
                           
The music's on and I'm dancing (Hey)
                              
I'm normally in the corner just standing (Hey)
  
I'm feeling unusual
                            
I don't care 'cause this my night

I'm not myself tonight
                             
Tonight I'm not the same girl, same girl

I'm taking shots and I'm feeling fine
                         
I'm kissing all the boys and the girls

Someone call the doctor 'cause I lost my mind

The old me's gone, I feel brand new

And if you don't like it, fuck you
