SOL
 Young girl, don't cry I'll be right here

you'll soon be free to fly,  ooh
            MIm           RE/DO
When you're safe inside your room,
DO        SOLadd9/SI RE
you tend to     dream
     MIm                 RE/DO DO     SOL   RE
Of a place where nothing's harder than it seems
       MIm         RE/DO DO      SOLadd9/SI RE
No one ever wants or  bothers to explain
       MIm             RE/DO    DO   
Of the heartache life can  bring 
          LAm    RE4  RE
and what it means

             SOL    SOL5+      SOL6      SOL7

Ooh, whoa yeah
SOL
 Young girl, just hold tight
                               DOadd9   RE4
Soon you're gonna see your brighter day, oh

Now in a world where innocence 
           SOLadd9/SI  RE4 RE
is quickly claimed
        MIm              RE/DO
It's so hard to stand your ground 
     DO     SOL    RE
when you're  so afraid
  MIm                RE/DO 
No one reaches out a hand  
DO         SOLadd9/SI  RE
for you to hold
         MIm                RE/DO DO
