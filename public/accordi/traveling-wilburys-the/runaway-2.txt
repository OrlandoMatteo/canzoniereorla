LAm
 As I walk along
  SOL    
I wonder what went wrong
     FA                           MI7
With our love, a love that was so strong
LAm
 And as I still walk on
  SOL                              FA
I think of the things we've done together
                       MI7
Awhile our hearts were young


LA
 I'm a-walkin' in the rain
FA#m
 Tears are fallin' and I feel the pain
LA
 Wishin' you were here by me
FA#m
 To end this misery
         LAadd9
And I wonder
                  FA#m7
I wah-wah-wah-wah-wonder
LAadd9
Why
                    FA#m7
Why, why, why, why, why she ran away
      RE
And I wonder
               MI7
Where she will stay
          LA
My little runaway
RE                  LA      MI7
Run, run, run, run, runaway
