Hands are sweaty

My heart beats heavy
        SIb5
There's something out there

But I swear, I'm not ready
    SOL5           LA5                   REm   LA5
And I don't really know where to go from here
    REm
The sounds getting louder

The floor starts shaking
SIb5
Everybody's feeling it
                      SOL5
Why can't I feel it? No
LA5                     REm
Why can't I just let it go?
                             REm  SIb5 LA5   SIb5 LA5
Cause all I can feel is vertigo....
REm       SIb5 LA5 SOL5 LA5
All I can feel is  ver--ti---go

REm
Gotta get outta my head

Do something that I'll regret
                      SIb
He's dancing now with someone he met

I'm losing my sanity

Get rid of my vanity
SOLm             LA       
All I can feel is, feel is
REm               SOL5 LA5 REm
All I can feel is ver--ti--go

      REm
Their faces seem deadly

It just got messy
    SIb
His eyes bloodshot

But he's going in steady
    SOLm           LA                 REm   LA
And I don't really know why I'm still here
       REm
And my head keeps pounding

My feet still hurting
  SIb
I think I lost sight of

Where I was going
    SOLm           LA                    REm
And I don't really know where to go from here

 Caught inside of a dark night out
SIb      SOLm7    REm  DO
 Left me standing by myself
