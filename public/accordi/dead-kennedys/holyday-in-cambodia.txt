So you been to school

For a year or two

And you know you've seen it all

Play ethnicky jazz
     RE
To parade your snazz
        SOL            RE
On your five-grand stereo
SOL
Braggin' that you know
        RE
How the niggers feel cold

And the slums got so much soul

You're a star-belly sneetch

You suck like a leech

You want everyone to act like you

Kiss ass while you bitch

Well you'll work harder

With a gun in your back
