LAm
 Where have all the good men gone
    SOL
And where are all the gods?
FA                                 MI7
Where's the streetwise Hercules to fight the rising odds?
LAm                          MIm
 Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?
REm
 Late at night I toss and I turn
      MI7
And I dream of what I need

         LAm
I need a hero
                      MIm
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night
     FA
He's gotta be strong

And he's gotta be fast
         DO                      SOL
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
         LAm
I need a hero
                      MIm
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light
     FA
He's gotta be sure

And it's gotta be soon
         DO                   SOL
And he's gotta be larger than life!
       LAm       SOL  FA  MI7/4 MI7
Larger than life

LAm
 Somewhere after midnight
      SOL
In my wildest fantasy
FA
Somewhere just beyond my reach
        MI7
There's someone reaching back for me
LAm                        MIm
 Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat
REm                            MI7
 It's gonna take a superman to sweep me off my feet

                                             FA
Up where the mountains meet the heavens above
                                       REm
Out where the lightning splits the sea
                       MI7
I could swear there is someone, somewhere
LAm
Watching me
                                             FA
Through the wind, and the chill, and the rain
                              REm
And the storm, and the flood
                        MI7               LAm    
I can feel his approach like a fire in my blood
