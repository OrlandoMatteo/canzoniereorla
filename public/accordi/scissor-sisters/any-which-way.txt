FA#   DO#   RE#m   SI

FA#                DO#
 The world spit me out 
                    RE#m
and I was spinning around
                   SI
Lost in a free fall
FA#            DO#
 Forever going down
                          RE#m
And breakin' through the ground
            
When I thought I reached the end
SI
 I start to fall again
    FA#   DO#       RE#m7   SI
But I was taught to never surrender
          FA#         DO#
When it's hard to get up
      RE#m7            SI
Gonna fight till I can stand and say...

FA#                 DO#
Oh, you can turn me down, 
                  RE#m7
you can throw me now
                    SI                      
The harder out, the harder I come back around
FA#               DO#
 You can break my heart 
                          RE#m7
but you can't scratch my name
                SI       
I can take the hit, 'cause I'm a boomerang
FA#    DO#      RE#m     SI
Oh, whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa
                
I'm a boomerang...
FA#    DO#      RE#m     SI
Oh, whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa
 
I'm a boomerang...

FA#               DO#
 Now I'm 10 feet tall, 
                         RE#m
all my problems feel so small
                     SI
Nothing in my way to make me change
FA#                DO#
 No ceiling to my sky, 
                    RE#m
just open space to fly
                  
Every time I'm feeling down, 
SI
 I turn it back around
    FA#   DO#       RE#m7   SI
But I was taught to never surrender
          FA#         DO#
When it's hard to get up
      RE#m7            SI
Gonna fight till I can stand and say...

FA#                 DO#
Oh, you can turn me down, 
                  RE#m7
you can throw me now
                    SI                      
The harder out, the harder I come back around
FA#               DO#
 You can break my heart 
                          RE#m7
but you can't scratch my name
                SI       
I can take the hit, 'cause I'm a boomerang
FA#    DO#      RE#m     SI
Oh, whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa
                
I'm a boomerang...
FA#    DO#      RE#m     SI
Oh, whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa
 
I'm a boomerang... 

SOL#5            SI5
 Even though I'm flying high, 
    RE#5               DO#5
the sky can change one day
SOL#5             SI5
 I could hit some turbulence, 
          FA#5              DO#5    
but who I am is never gonna change, 
                    FA#  DO#  RE#m7  SIadd9
'cause I'm a boomerang
                    FA#  DO#  RE#m7  SIadd9
'Cause I'm a boomerang...

'Cause I'm a boomerang...

FA#                 DO#
Oh, you can turn me down, 
                  RE#m7
you can throw me now
                    SI                      
The harder out, the harder I come back around
FA#               DO#
 You can break my heart 
                          RE#m7
but you can't scratch my name
                SI       
I can take the hit, 'cause I'm a boomerang
FA#    DO#      RE#m     SI
Oh, whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa
                
I'm a boomerang...
FA#    DO#      RE#m     SI
Oh, whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa
 
I'm a boomerang...
