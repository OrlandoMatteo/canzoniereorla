I'm young and I'm strong
              FAm          REb          LAb
I've got this God forsaken world by the balls!
           MIb     REb       LAb
I've got a one-way ticket to freedom
LAb                   MIb                 LAb
  Ain't got no one now gonna take it from me
        LAb      REb        LAb
I was a soldier, age twenty-one
     FAm         REb                      LAb
In a war I'm not sure what I was fighting for
          MIb           REb      LAb
And yet I turned from a boy to a man there
LAb                   MIb             LAb
  Goodbye to innocence and a sweet sixteen

FAm        REb    LAb         MIb
  My whole life I could not arrange
FAm         REb    LAb         MIb
  My wicked ways I could never change
      FAm        REb    MIb      LAb
Don't try, don't try now to understand
    LAb               MIb          LAb
For this is the ballad of a lonely man

         LAb  REb       LAb
Close to me   is a photograph
     FAm         REb        LAb
Of a family left far, far behind
          MIb  REb              LAb
At once I had  love it slipped away from
             LAb     MIb        LAb
I searched a lifetime but could not find

     LAb      REb                LAb
In a hospital bed, I'm violently ill
              FAm           REb      LAb
Just one more drink nurse I swear to God!
            MIb      REb       LAb
I've got my St. Anthony and my whiskey
LAb               MIb         LAb
 Yes I'm a veteran of three foreign wars!

FAm        REb    LAb         MIb
  My whole life I could not arrange
FAm         REb    LAb         MIb
  My wicked ways I could never change
      FAm        REb    MIb      LAb
Don't try, don't try now to understand
    LAb               MIb          LAb
For this is the ballad of a lonely man
LAb               MIb          LAb
This is the ballad of a lonely man
LAb               MIb          LAb
This is the ballad of a lonely man
