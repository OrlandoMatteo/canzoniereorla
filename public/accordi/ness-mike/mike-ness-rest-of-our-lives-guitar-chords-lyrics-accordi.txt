Eighteen years in a traveling band

Seen a lot of one night stands
    FA                                 DO
And still I found myself so very much alone

And it took those years to find myself

Wasn't lookin' for no one else
    FA
And then I found you girl
                        DO
But you were there all along
          SOL                          FA
And we'll spend each day like it's the last day
                    DO
for the rest of our lives

DO
I'll be the king you'll be my wife

Gonna make it thru this thing called life
      FA
Gonna raise these kids on our own
                 DO
The very best we can

And sixteen hours is a long, long time

When you gotta love that's on your mind
        FA
Can you tell that I'm not right?
                DO
I'm a little distraught

          SOL                          FA
And we'll spend each day like it's the last day
                    DO
for the rest of our lives
     SOL                                  FA
Everyday we'll fall in love just a little more
                    DO
For the rest of our lives

DO   FA   DO

Sittin' here in the county jail

Ain't no one to go my bail
  FA
I shoulda been there with you
                      DO
For some sympathy and tea

And eighteen years in a traveling band
