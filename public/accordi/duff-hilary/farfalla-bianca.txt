Where did we come from?
RE/FA#
Why are we here?
SOL                    RE  RE/DO#
Where do we go when we die?
SIm
What lies beyond
    SIm/LA
And what lay before?
   MI                  LA
Is anything certain in life?
          RE
They say, life is too short
    RE/FA#
The here and the now
    SOL                   RE   RE/DO#
And you're only given one shot
    SIm
But could there be more
     SIm/LA
Have I lived before
   MI                           LA4  LA
Or could this be all that we've got?
SOL        LA
If I die tomorrow
           RE
I'd be all right
  RE/DO#    SIm
Because I believe

I used to be frightened of dying
  SOL                         RE  RE/DO#
I used to think death was the end

But that was before

I'm not scared anymore

I know that my soul will transcend

I may never find all the answers

I may never understand why

I may never prove

What I know to be true

But I know that I still have to try

If I die tomorrow
         RE
I'd be alright
  RE/DO#    SIm
Because I believe

Move on, be brave

Don't weep at my grave

Safe in the light that surrounds me

Free of the fear and the pain

The meaning in my life again
