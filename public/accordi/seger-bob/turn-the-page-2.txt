On a long and lonesome highway

East of Omaha
        RE
You can listen to the engine

Moanin' out his one note song
        LA
You can think about the woman
                                 MIm
Or the girl you knew the night before

But your thoughts will soon be wandering
       
The way they always do
            RE
When you're ridin' sixteen hours

And there's nothin' much to do
        LA
And you don't feel much like ridin'
                                  MIm
You just wish the trip was through

           RE
See here I am
       MIm
On the road again
        RE
There I am
          MIm
Up on the stage
       RE
Here I go
        LA
Playin' star again
        DO  RE
There I go

Well you walk into a restaurant

Strung out from the road
        RE
And you feel the eyes upon you
       
As you're shakin' off the cold
       LA
You pretend it doesn't bother you
                            MIm
But you just want to explode
                         
Most times you can't hear 'em talk
           
Other times you can
        RE
All the same old cliches

"Is that a woman or a man?"
        LA
And you always seem outnumbered
                           MIm
You don't dare make a stand

Out there in the spotlight

You're a million miles away
RE
Every ounce of energy
  
You try to give away
       LA
As the sweat pours out your body
                            MIm
Like the music that you play

Later in the evening

As you lie awake in bed
         RE
With the echoes from the amplifiers

Ringin' in your head
    LA
You smoke the day's last cigarette
                          MIm
Rememberin' what she said

       RE
Here I am
