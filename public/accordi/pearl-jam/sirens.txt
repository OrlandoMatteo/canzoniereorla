MIb
 Hear the sirens
DOm          
 Hear the sirens
MIb
 Hear the sirens,
                     DOm DO4 DOm DO4
Hear the circus so profound
 MIb
I  hear the sirens
                       DOm    DO4 DOm DO4
More and more in this here town
       SIb
Let me catch my breath to breathe
           MIb       SOLm  SIb
And reach across the bed

Just to know we're safe
      MIb       DOm   
I am a grateful man
    SIb
The slightest bit of light
          MIb     SOLm
And I can see you clear

DOm
Oh, have to take your hand
    MIb       SIb
And feel your breath for fear 
     FAm7               DOm
this someday will be over
           MIb               SIb     
I pull you close, so much to lose knowing 
        FAm7             MIb/SOL LAb
that nothing lasts forever
         MIb                  SIb
I didn't care before you were here
                     FAm7            MIb/SOL LAb
I danced in laughter with the everafter
               MIb
But all things change
           SIb      MIb   DOm   
Let this remain

MIb
 Hear the sirens
                       DOm    DO4 DOm DO4
Covering distance in the night
    MIb
The sound echoing closer
                        DOm    DO4 DOm DO4
Will they come for me next time?
    SIb
For every choice, mistake I've made
     MIb    SOLm
it's not my plan
SIb                          MIb    DOm
 To send you in the arms of another man
    SIb
And if you choose to stay I'll wait
     MIb   SOLm
I'll understand
DOm7             
 Oh, it's a fragile thing
     MIb     SIb
This life we lead
               FAm7
If I think too much
              DOm             MIb
I can get over-whelmed by the grace
            SIb
By which we live our lives
     FAm7
with death over our shoulders
MIb/SOL LAb          MIb                SIb          
         Want you to know that should I go
                     FAm7
I always loved you, held you high above, true
MIb/SOL LAb             MIb
           I study your face
                   FAm   MIb  DOm
and the fear goes away

 It's a fragile thing
     MIb     SIb
This life we lead
               FAm7
If I think too much
              DOm             MIb
I can get over-whelmed by the grace

I always loved you, held you high above, true
MIb/SOL LAb             MIb
           I study your face
                   SIb
and the fear goes away,
               FAm7
The fear goes away,
           MIb/SOL LAb   MIb
The fear goes     away,
               SIb
The fear goes away
           FAm7
Ah-ah, oh-oh
          MIb/SOL LAb   MIb   SIb   FAm7
Ah-ah, oh-oh...
