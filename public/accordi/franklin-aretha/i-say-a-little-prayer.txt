FA#m          SIm7
 The moment I wake up
             MI    LA7+
Before I put on my makeup
  RE                       DO#7
I say a little prayer for you
FA#m              SIm7
 While combing my hair, now,
                   MI       LA7+
And wondering what dress to wear, now,
  RE                      DO#7
I say a little prayer for you

  RE         MI          DO#m        FA#m
Forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart
           LA7
And I will love you
  RE        MI       DO#m       FA#m
Forever, forever, we never will part
             LA7
Oh, how I'll love you
  RE        MI             DO#m         FA#m
Together, together, that's how it must be
           LA7
To live without you
      RE                     DO#7
Would only be heartbreak for me

FA#m           SIm7
 I run for the bus, dear,
               MI       LA7+
While riding I think of us, dear,
  RE                      DO#7
I say a little prayer for you
FA#m            SIm7
 At work I just take time
                   MI     LA7+
And all through my coffee break-time,
  RE                      DO#7
I say a little prayer for you

  RE       MI            DO#m        FA#m
Forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart
           LA7
And I will love you
  RE       MI       DO#m        FA#m
Forever, forever we never will part
             LA
Oh, how I'll love you
