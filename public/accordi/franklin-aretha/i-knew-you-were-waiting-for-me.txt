MIm                    MIm/RE#
 Give me the flammable light
              MIm/RE          DO#m7/5-
I'm cold as a match, ready to strike
    DO7+   LA9
So, here I go
MIm                  MIm/RE#
 Here lies a city on fire
         MIm/RE
Singing along
             DO#m7/5-
The arsonist choir
     DO7+ MIm LA9
Now, here I   go

MIm FA#m SOL RE LA/DO#

           LA          MIm FA#m SOL RE
It started with a spark
LA/DO#       LA
 And burning to the dark
     DO   MIm LA
Now, here I   go

MIm                     MIm/RE#
 There is a river I've found
          MIm/RE
Into the wild
           DO#m7/5-
Under the ground
    DO7+ MIm LA9
So, here I   go

MIm FA#m SOL RE LA/DO#

         LA         MIm FA#m SOL RE
A button on a string
LA/DO#       LA
 And I heard everything
    DO7+ MIm LA7
Now here I   go

MIm    FA#m SOL MIm    FA#m SOL 

MIm    FA#m SOL MIm    FA#m SOL 

    MIm                FA#m SOL  
Oh, sweet ignition, be my fuse
    MIm                      FA#m SOL 
You have no choice, you have to   choose
MIm               FA#m SOL 
Bid farewell to yesterday
MIm                  FA#m SOL    DO MIm LA7            
Say goodbye, I'm on my   way
                   DO MIm LA7
But in the end, we all
             
Come from what's come before
    DO   MIm LA7
So, here I   go...

MIm    FA#m SOL MIm    FA#m SOL 

MIm    FA#m SOL MIm    FA#m SOL 

    MIm                FA#m SOL  
Oh, sweet ignition, be my fuse
    MIm                      FA#m SOL 
You have no choice, you have to   choose
MIm               FA#m SOL 
Bid farewell to yesterday
MIm                  FA#m SOL             
Say goodbye, I'm on my   way   
  MIm                 FA#m SOL
I threw it all away because
 MIm                FA#m SOL
I had to be what never was
MIm               FA#m  SOL
Been so hungry I could lie
MIm                  FA#m SOL
Took my word, I took your wine
    MIm                MIm/DO# MIm/RE 
And held you in my bloody     hands
      MIm                  MIm/DO# MIm/RE
These rattled bones and rubber bands
MIm                      MIm/DO# MIm/RE
Washed them in the muddy water
MIm                            MIm/DO# MIm/RE
Looking for a dime and found a quarter
    MIm                       MIm/DO# MIm/RE
But you can't make me change my     name
MIm                          MIm/DO# MIm/RE
You'll never make me change my      name
MIm                     MIm/DO# MIm/RE
Pay no mind, now, ain't that   something?
MIm                 MIm/DO# MIm/RE
Fuck it all, I came from   nothing

 From nothing
