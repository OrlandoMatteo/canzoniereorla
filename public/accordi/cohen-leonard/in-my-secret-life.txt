 I saw you this morning
                   REm
You were moving so fast
              SIb
Can't seem to loosen my grip
       DO    
On the past
      FA
And I miss you so much
                  REm
There's no one in sight
          SIb          DO    
And we're still making love

REm      DO/MI FA
 In my secret life
REm      DO/MI FA
 In my secret life

  FA
I smile when I'm angry
              REm
I cheat and I lie
          SIb
I do what I have to do
       DO
To get by
      FA
But I know what is wrong
                   REm
And I know what is right
        SIb         DO   
And I'd die for the truth

REm      DO/MI FA
 In my secret life
REm      DO/MI FA
 In my secret life

     REm      DO     SIb
Hold on, hold on, my brother
   REm     DO      SIb
My sister, hold on tight
  REm      DO    SIb    
I finally got my orders
        SOLm7               
I'll be marching through the morning
LAm7
Marching through the night
SIb          
Moving cross the borders
      DO
Of my secret life

FA
  I bite my lip
                REm 
I buy what I'm told
SIb
 From the latest hit
                 DO
To the wisdom of old
        FA
But I'm always alone
                     REm
And my heart is like ice
         SIb         DO
And it's crowded and cold

REm      DO/MI FA
 In my secret life
REm      DO/MI FA
 In my secret life
REm      DO/MI FA
 In my secret life
REm      DO/MI FA
 In my secret life...
