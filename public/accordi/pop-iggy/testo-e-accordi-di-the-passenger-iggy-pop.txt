Though I've tried before to tell her
        DOm7           SIb/RE
Of the feelings I have for her
    LAbadd9  SIb  DOm7  SIb7/RE
in my  heart
      LAbadd9          SIb
Every time that I come near her
       DOm7                  SIb7/RE       MIb
I just lose my nerve as I've done from the start

             SIb               MIb
Every little thing she does is magic
               SIb               MIb
Everything she do just turns me on
               SIb             MIb
Even though my life before was tragic
              SIb               SI
Now I know my love for her goes on

     LAbadd9          SIb
Do I have to tell the story
     DOm7           SIb7/RE
Of a thousand rainy days
            LAbadd9 SIb  DOm7  SIb7/RE
since we first   met
       LAbadd9      SIb
It's a big enough umbrella
         DOm7           SIb/RE          MIb
But it's always me that ends up getting wet

             SIb               MIb
Every little thing she does is magic
               SIb               MIb
Everything she do just turns me on
               SIb             MIb
Even though my life before was tragic
              SIb               SI
Now I know my love for her goes on

 I resolved to call her up
LAbm7               SIbm7
 A thousand times a day
LAbm7                  SIbm7
 And ask her if she'll marry me
SI                      SIbm7
 In some old fashioned way
       SI                REbadd9
But my silent fears have gripped me
       SI                REbadd9
Long before I reach the phone
        SI                 REbadd9
Long before my tongue has tripped me
       SI     REbadd9  MIb
Must I always be      alone?

Everything she do just turns me on

Even though my life before was tragic
              SIb               MIb
Now I know my love for her goes on
