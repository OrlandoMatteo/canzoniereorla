MI      
 Well it's been building up inside of me
  LA           SI 
For oh I don't know how long
MI
 I don't know why
           
But I keep thinking
 LA                 SI
Something's bound to go wrong
FA#m           SI
 But she looks in my eyes
SOL#m         DO#7
 And makes me realize


     FA#                   SOL#m7
And she says "don't worry, baby"
             DO#7
Don't worry, baby
                     FA#
Everything will turn out alright
             SOL#m7
Don't worry, baby
             DO#7    MI/SI SI7
Don't worry, baby


MI
 I guess I should've kept my mouth shut
      LA                SI
When I started to brag about my car
MI
 But I can't back down now because
 LA                SI
I pushed the other guys too far
FA#m          SI
 She makes me come alive
SOL#m         DO#7
 And makes me wanna drive


     FA#                   SOL#m7
And she says "don't worry, baby"
             DO#7
Don't worry, baby
                     FA#
Everything will turn out alright
             SOL#m7
Don't worry, baby
             DO#7    MI/SI SI7
Don't worry, baby

 She told me "Baby, when you race today
    LA            SI
Just take along my love with you
MI
 And if you knew how much I loved you
    LA                SI
Baby, nothing could go wrong with you"
FA#m         SI
 Oh what she does to me
SOL#m           DO#7
 When she makes love to me

Don't worry, baby
             DO#7    
Don't worry, baby
