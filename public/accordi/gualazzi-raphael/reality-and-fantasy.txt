Someone, upon that wall
              MIbm7                        LAbm
Is just gonna spend the night with my girl
                             MIbm7
That’s what I’m talkin’ about

That’s why
                    LAbm
I’m gonna play this shout

The wall between
                    MIbm7
Reality and fantasy

Is Sometimes so small
            LAbm
And not so tall

The wall between
                    MIbm7
Reality and fantasy

Is Sometimes so small
            LAbm   MIbm7   LAbm     
And not so tall

     LAbm  
I’ve looked into your eyes
                     MIbm7                   LAbm              
And it should make me feel so bright, satisfied
                         MIbm7
The only thing I’ve learned
                               LAbm
Is just to fall, and fall, and fall!

The wall between
                  MIbm7
Reality and fantasy

Is Sometimes so small
            LAbm
And not so tall

The wall between
                  MIbm7
Reality and fantasy

Is Sometimes so small
            LAbm   MIbm7   LAbm   
And not so tall

REbm     MIbm          LAbm     MIbm
Have you ever seen the shame in life,
REbm     MIbm           LAbm    MIb    LAbm
Smell of deadly colours in your sigh

    LAbm
Sometimes our life is strange
                 MIbm7
And it seems you gotta do it all by yourself
          LAbm
To arrange
                     MIbm7
Sensations never felt
                              LAbm
that’s why my soul I’ll never sell

The wall between
                  MIbm7
Reality and fantasy

Is Sometimes so small
            LAbm
And not so tall

The wall between
                  MIbm7
Reality and fantasy

Is Sometimes so small
            LAbm   MIbm7   LAbm   MIbm7
And not so tall
