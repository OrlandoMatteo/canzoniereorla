              RE          SOL      RE
I'm a rollin' stone, all alone and lost
                                   LA
For a life of sin, I have paid the cost
            SOL                RE
When I pass by, all the people say
                        LA7      RE
Just another guy on the lost highway
                            SOL    RE
Just a deck of cards, and a jug of wine
                                     LA
And a woman's lies makes a life like mine
               SOL          RE
Oh, the day we met, I went astray
                            LA7    RE
I started rolling down that lost highway

             RE          SOL RE
I was just a lad, nearly 2---2
                                      LA
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
            SOL               RE
And now I'm lost, too late to pray
                            LA7      RE
Lord, I take a cost, oh the lost highway
                        SOL      RE
Now boys don't start to ramblin' round
                                    LA
On this road of sin, are you sorrow-bound?
          SOL                      RE
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
                              LA7      RE
You started rollin' down that lost highway
