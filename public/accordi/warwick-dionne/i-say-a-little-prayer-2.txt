 The moment I wake up 
             RE9   SOL7+
Before I put on my makeup 
  FA#m7                   SI7
I say a little prayer for you 
MIm7              LAm7
 While combing my hair, now 
                   RE9      SOL7+
And wondering what dress to wear, now 
  FA#m7                   SI7
I say a little prayer for you 

  DO7+     RE/DO         SIm7
Forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart 
    SOL    SOL7/4
And I will love you 
  DO7+     RE/DO     SIm7
Forever, forever, we never will part 
    SOL7/4
Oh, how I'll love you 
  DO7+      RE/DO   SIm7
Together, together, that's how it must be 
   SOL    SOL7/4
To live without you 
      DO7+    RE/DO          SI7
Would only be heartbreak for me 

MIm7           LAm7
 I run for the bus, dear 
               RE9      SOL7+
While riding I think of us, dear 
  FA#m7                   SI7
I say a little prayer for you 
MIm7             LAm7
 At work, I just take time 
                   RE9    SOL7+
And all through my coffee break-time 
  FA#m7                   SI7 
I say a little prayer for you 

  DO7+     RE/DO         SIm7
Forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart 
    SOL    SOL7/4
And I will love you 
  DO7+     RE/DO     SIm7
Forever, forever, we never will part 
    SOL7/4
Oh, how I'll love you 
  DO7+      RE/DO   SIm7
Together, together, that's how it must be 
   SOL    SOL7/4
To live without you 
      DO7+    RE/DO          SI7
Would only be heartbreak for me  

MIm7  LAm7    RE9  SOL7+  FA#m7  SI7 

MIm7  LAm7    RE9  SOL7+  FA#m7  SI7     

  DO7+     RE/DO         SIm7
Forever, forever, you'll stay in my heart 
    SOL    SOL7/4
And I will love you 
  DO7+     RE/DO     SIm7
Forever, forever, we never will part 
    SOL7/4
Oh, how I'll love you 
  DO7+      RE/DO   SIm7
Together, together, that's how it must be 
   SOL7/4
To live without you 
      DO7+    RE/DO          SI7
Would only be heartbreak for me  

MIm7           LAm7      RE11         
 My darling, believe me   

For me there is no one
   SOL7+    RE11   SOL7+       RE11
But  you    Please love me too
                 SOL7+  RE11        SOL7+           
I’m in love with you      answer my prayer
RE11             SOL7+    RE11             
   Say you love me too            
                        SOL7+   RE11           
Why don’t you answer my prayer      You know
                        SOL7+   RE11           
Everyday I say a little prayer      I said
                      SOL7+    RE11           
I say, I say a little prayer
                             SOL7+    
Why don’t you just answer my prayer...
