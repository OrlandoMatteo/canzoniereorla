RE  LA  SOL  RE

     RE                      SOL
When dreaming I'm guided to another world
               RE     SOL
Time and time again
   RE                       SOL
At sunrise I fight to stay asleep
                                 RE              SOL
'Cause I don't want to leave the comfort of this place
                 RE                     SOL
'Cause there's a hunger, a longing to escape
                          RE     SOL
From the life I live when I'm awake
         FA#m
So let's go there
      SOL
Let's make our escape
               FA#m
Come on, let's go there
      SOL
Let's ask can we stay?

RE       LA/DO#  SOL    RE
 Can you take me Higher?
     LA/DO#      SOL       RE   
To a place where blind men see
        LA/DO#  SOL    RE
Can you take me Higher?
     LA/DO#     SOL    RE
To a place with golden streets

   RE                              SOL
Although I would like our world to change
                 RE
It helps me to appreciate
                       SOL
Those nights and those dreams
     RE                       SOL
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
                    RE                      SOL
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same
    RE              SOL
The only difference is
              RE            SOL
To let love replace all our hate
         FA#m
So let's go there
      SOL
Let's make our escape
               FA#m
Come on, let's go there
      SOL
Let's ask can we stay?

RE       LA/DO#  SOL    RE
 Can you take me Higher?
     LA/DO#      SOL       RE   
To a place where blind men see
        LA/DO#  SOL    RE
Can you take me Higher?
     LA/DO#     SOL    RE
To a place with golden streets

        FA#m           SOL
So lets go there, lets go there,
              FA#m
Come on, lets go there
     SOL
Lets ask can we stay?

RE         LA             SOL          RE
 Up high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time
                LA               SOL
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams
    RE
And make them mine

                LA               SOL
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams
    RE
And make them mine

To a place where blind men see
        LA/DO#  SOL    RE
Can you take me Higher?

To a place with golden streets
        LA/DO#  SOL    RE
Can you take me Higher?
     LA/DO#      SOL       RE   
To a place where blind men see
        LA/DO#  SOL    RE
Can you take me Higher?
     LA/DO#     SOL    RE
To a place with golden streets
