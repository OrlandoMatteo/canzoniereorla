And the best one of the year

Dozing off underneath my sheets

While I cover both my ears
SOL      LA         RE  SOL
But if I wait for a holiday
         LA      RE
Could it stop my fears?
   SOL LA       RE       SOL
To go away on a summer's day

When I'm counting on my teeth

Could it stop my fears?

it turned all the history books grey

I got wheels, I got Cutter spray

And a healthy sense of worth

Half of me is the gasoline
