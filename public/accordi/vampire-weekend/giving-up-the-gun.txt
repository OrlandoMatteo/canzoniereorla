LA                  FA#m
 Your sword's grown old and rusty
SIm     MI        RE
Burnt beneath the rising sun
LA              FA#m
 It's locked up like a trophy
   MI              RE
Forgetting all the things it's done
LA               FA#m
 And though it's been a long time
       SIm        MI        RE
You're right back where you started from
LA        FA#m
 I see it in your eyes
     MI                RE
That now you're giving up the gun
LA                    FA#m                  MI
 When I was seventeen, I had wrists like steel
              RE
And I felt complete
LA                   FA#m                   MI
 And now my body fades behind a brass charade
            RE
And I'm obsolete
LA                        FA#m
 But if the chance remains to see those better days
MI                   RE
 I'd cut the cannons down
LA                        FA#m
 My ears are blown to bits from all the rifle hits
MI                      RE
 But still I crave that sound

LA                  FA#m
 Your sword's grown old and rusty
SIm     MI        RE
Burnt beneath the rising sun

 I heard you play guitar down at a seedy bar
MI                       RE
 Where skinheads used to fight
LA                  FA#m
 Your Tokugawa smile and your garbage style
MI                RE
 Used to save the night
MI                        RE
 You felt the coming wave, told me we'd all be brave
MI
 You said you wouldn't flinch
MI                           RE
 But in the years that passed, since I saw you last

You haven't moved an inch

LA                  FA#m
 Your sword's grown old and rusty
SIm     MI        RE

 I see you shine in your way
   MI            RE
Go on, go on, go on
LA         FA#m
 I see you shine in your way

Go on, go on, go on
