You found a sweater on the ocean floor

They're gonna find it
if you didn't close the door

You and the smart ones
sit outside of their sight

In a house on a street
they wouldn't park on at night

Dad was a risk-taker

His was a shoe maker

You, greatest hits 2006 little list-maker

Heard codes in the melodies

You heeded the call

You were born with ten fingers
and you're gonna use em all

Interesting colors I discovered myself

If your art life is gritty
you'll be toasting my health

If an interest in culture
should be lining the walls

When your birthright is interest
you could just accrue it all
