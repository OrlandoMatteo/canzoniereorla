 Have you seen my hands
                     SIb/RE MIb
Just look at 'em shake
                             SIb DOm7
And the song just keeps on repeating
                      SIb/RE MIb
Drop the needle again
                           SIb DOm7
And I dance with your ghost
                           SIb LAb
Oh, but that ain't the way
                                     SIb
I can't move on and I can't stay the same
                      DOm7
And all my friends say

    LAb  MIb   SIb               DOm7
Hey he---y,    turn the record over
    LAb  MIb         SIb                  MIb
Hey he---y, and I'll see you on the flip side
          SIb DOm              LAb        MIb
There you go, turn the key and engine over
        SIb DOm          LAb
Let 'er go, let somebody else lay 
       DOm7  MIb/SIb  LAbadd9  MIb/SIb
at her feet

 But have you seen my heart
                         SIb/RE MIb
Have you seen how it bleeds
                            SIb  DOm7                   
And the nights are so long, baby
                    SIb/RE MIb
Out here in the deep
                            SIb  DOm7
The tick, ticking of hours, lonely
                SIb LAb
I hear the alarm
                                       SIb
I used to hear when she would sleep in my arms

    LAb  MIb   SIb               DOm7
Hey he---y,    turn the record over
    LAb  MIb         SIb                  MIb
Hey he---y, and I'll see you on the flip side
          SIb DOm              LAb        MIb
There you go, turn the key and engine over
        SIb DOm          LAb
Let 'er go, let somebody else lay 
       DOm    SOLm    LAb    SIb
at her feet

Where you used to be
                  MIb    SIb LAb
Where you used to be
                  MIb   SIb   LAb    SIb   DOm7
Where you used to be    here with me
