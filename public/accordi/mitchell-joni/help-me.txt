Help me, I think I'm fallin' in love again
                       
When I get that crazy feelin',

'cause you're a rambler and a gambler
    
And a sweet talkin' ladies man
        DO7+      SOL7+
And you love your lovin' (lovin')

Help me, I think I'm fallin' in love too fast
                          
It's got me hopin' for the future 


    FA7+
and worryin' about the past
             
'Cause I've seen some hot, 
                       
hot blazes come down to smoke and ash

We love our lovin' (lovin')

Oh, didn't it feel good? 

We were sittin' there talkin'
                           
Or lyin' there not talkin', didn't it feel good?

That's such a lonely thing to do

Both of us flirtin' around
 
Flirtin' and flirtin', hurtin' too
