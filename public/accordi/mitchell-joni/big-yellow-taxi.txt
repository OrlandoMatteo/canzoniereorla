     LA
They paved paradise
                     MI
And put up a parking lot
       LA            SI
With a pink hotel, a boutique
      MI
And a swinging hot spot

Don't it always seem to go
         LA                     MI
That you don't know what you've got
 
Till it's gone

They paved paradise
    SI               MI
And put up a parking lot
     LA
They took all the trees
                    MI
Put 'em in a tree museum 
         LA
And they charged the people
  SI                        MI
A dollar and a half just to see 'em

Don't it always seem to go
         LA                     MI
That you don't know what you've got

Till it's gone

They paved paradise
    SI               MI
And put up a parking lot

Hey farmer farmer
                MI
Put away that DDT now
        LA
Give me spots on my apples
    SI                         MI
But leave me the birds and the bees

Please!

Don't it always seem to go

Late last night
                        MI
I heard the screen door slam
      LA
And a big yellow taxi
SI               MI
Took away my old man
                      
Don't it always seem to go
         LA                     MI

    SI               MI
And put up a parking lot
         LA                     MI

Till it's gone
     LA
They paved paradise
    SI               MI
And put up a parking lot
