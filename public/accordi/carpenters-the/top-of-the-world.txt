Such a feelin's comin' over me
         REm            DOm7  FA    SIb
There is wonder in most every thing I see
      MIb          FA           REm       SOL7/4
Not a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes
SOL7  DOm7         DOm7/5-          FA7/4  FA7
And I  won't be surprised if it's a dream

Everything I want the world to be
       REm           DOm7   FA  SIb
Is now comin' true especially for me
        MIb       FA            REm           SOL7/4
And the reason is clear, it's because you are here
SOL7       DOm7             DOm7/5-         FA7/4  FA7
You're the nearest thing to Heaven that I've seen

          SIb                     MIb
I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation
        SIb       DOm7   FA  SIb
And the only explanation I can find
       MIb            FA         SIb                MIb
Is the love that I've found ever since you've been around
            SIb           FA7/4 FA7    SIb
Your love's put me at the top   of the world

Somethin' in the wind has learned my name
         REm             DOm7       FA      SIb
And it's tellin' me that things are not the same
       MIb           FA            REm          SOL7/4
In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze
SOL7      DOm7              DOm7/5-      FA7/4  FA7
There's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me
SIb           FA       MIb  SIb         
There is only one wish on my mind
          REm              DOm7      FA   SIb
When this day is through I hope that I will find
       MIb         FA          REm              SOL7/4
That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me
SOL7  DOm7         DOm7/5-       FA7/4   FA7
All I need will be mine if you are here
