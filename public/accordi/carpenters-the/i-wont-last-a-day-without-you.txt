RE  FA#m7  SOL  RE/LA LA

RE         FA#m7      SOL             LA
 Day after day I must face a world of strangers
        SIm7/9            MIm7         LA4 LA     
Where I don't belong, I'm not that strong
RE            FA#m7
 It's nice to know that 
        SOL           LA
there's someone I can turn to
         SIm7/9              MIm7        LA4
Who will always care, you're always there

LA           RE         DO/RE     SOL    MIm7
When there's no getting over that rainbow
LA      RE          DO/RE         SOL    MIm7
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
LA    RE           DO/RE       SOL          RE/FA#
I can take all the madness the world has to give
      MIm7       LA11          
But I won't last a day 
        RE  FA#m7  SOL  LA4 LA 
without you...

RE  FA#m7  SOL  RE/LA LA

RE       FA#m7          SOL           LA
 So many times when the city seems to be
          SIm7/9           MIm7       LA
Without a friendly face, a lonely place
RE            FA#m7
 It's nice to know that 
       SOL           LA
you'll be there if I need you
           SIm7/9             MIm7       LA4
And you'll always smile, it's all worthwhile

SIm7     MI7          LA    DO#m7
Touch me and I end up singing
SIm7             MI7        FA#4  FA#
Troubles seem to up and disappear


    SOL#m7   DO#7                 FA#
You touch me with the love you're bringing
RE#m7          MI               FA#4  FA#
I can't really lose when you're near


            SOL/LA LA RE
When you're near,  my love
          FA#m7           SOL
If all my friends have forgotten 
           LA
half their promises
        SIm7/9           MIm7      LA
They're not unkind, just hard to find
RE           FA#m7     SOL
 One look at you and I know that 
        LA
I could learn to live
  SIm7/9               MIm7         LA11
Without the rest, I've found the best
