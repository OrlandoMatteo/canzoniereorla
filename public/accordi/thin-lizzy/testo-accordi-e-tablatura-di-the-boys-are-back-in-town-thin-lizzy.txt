 Remember that chick who used to dance a lot?
REb                FA7/4
 Every night on the floor she'll be shaking what she got,
DOm7                  FA7/4
 Man I tell you she was cool, she was red hot
SIbbm7           REb/MIb

 That chick got up and slapped Jonny's face,

 Man we just fell about the place,
