 I am just a cowboy lonesome on the trail
LAb            DOm7               FAm7   MIb REb
 A starry night the campfire light
LAb            MIb    FAm7 
 The coyote call
                  MIb   REb
And the howling winds wail
LAb             DOm7         FAm7    MIb REb
 So I'll ride out to the old sundown
