MI                 DO#m7
 I'm not a perfect person
                                       MI
There are many things I wish I didn't do
                DO#m7
But I continue learning
                                     LA
I never meant to do those things to you
                               SI
and so I have to say before I go
                         MI
that I just want you to know

                         DO#m
I've found a reason for me
                         LAadd9
to change who I used to be
                       SI
a reason to start over new
                  MI
and the reason is you

                  DO#m7
I'm sorry that I hurt you
                                      MI
It's something I must live with everyday
                        DO#m7
and all the pain I put you through
                                 LA
I wish that I could take it all away
                                    SI
and be the one who catches all your tears
                        MI
thats why I need you to hear

                         DO#m
I've found a reason for me
                         LAadd9
to change who I used to be
                       SI
a reason to start over new
                  REadd9
and the reason is you
                  MI
and the reason is you
                  REadd9
and the reason is you
                  MI
and the reason is you

                   DO#m7
I'm not a perfect person
                                    LA

                              SI
And so I have to say before I go
                         MI 
that I just want you to know

                         DO#m

and the reason is you
                        DO#m
I've found a reason to show
                        LA
a side of me you didn't know
                        SI
a reason for all that I do
                  MI
and the reason is you
