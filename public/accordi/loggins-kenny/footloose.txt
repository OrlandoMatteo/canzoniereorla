SIb                  MIb SIb
 Been working so hard
                    MIb SIb
I'm punching my card
                    MIb SIb
Eight hours for what

Oh, tell me what I got
MIb
 I've got this feeling
                           SIb
That times are holding me down
MIb
 I'll hit the ceiling
MIdim                      FA  SOLm7/4  LAb6  FA/LA
 Or else I'll tear up this town

                SIb     
Now I gotta cut loose, footloose
MIb                  SIb
Kick off your Sunday shoes

                  MIb SIb
Obeying every rule
                           MIb SIb
Deep way down in your heart
       
You're burning yearning for some
MIb
 Somebody to tell you
                             SIb
That life ain't passing you by
MIb
 I'm trying to tell you
MIdim                      FA  SOLm7/4  LAb6 
 It will if you don't even try...
        FA/LA
You can fly 

                  SIb
if you'd only cut loose, footloose
