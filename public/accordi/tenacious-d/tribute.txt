This is the greatest and best song in the world...
Tribute
Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here,
We was hitchhiking down a long and lonesome road
All of a sudden,
There shined a shiny demon,
In the middle of the road,
             LAm        
And he said!

Play the best song in the world, 
                     
or I'll eat your souls...

Parlato:
Well me and Kyle,
We looked at each other,

And we each said, Okay
       LAm
And we played the first thing 
     SOL
that came to our heads,
FA
Just so happened to be
    LAm              SOL
The best song in the world,
           FA
It was the best song in the world
RE                         FA
Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
        DO                     SOL
One and one makes two, two and one makes three,
       FA
It was destiny
RE                          FA
Once every hundred thousand years or so
         DO
When the sun doth shine
        SOL                    FA
And the moon doth glow and the grass doth grow

LAm
 Needless to say,

The beast was stunned

Whip-crack went his whippy tail,

And the beast was done

He asked us, ...Be you angels?

And we said nay, we are but men,

Rock!
RE  FA  DO  SOL  FA         LAm
Ah, ah, ah,    ..oh, wo, a-yo!
                SOL                  LAm
This is not the greatest song in the world, no
                  SOL  LAm
This is just a tribute!
                      SOL                  LAm

Parlato:
And the peculiar thing is this my friends,
The song we sang on that fateful night,
It didn't actually sound anything like this song!
