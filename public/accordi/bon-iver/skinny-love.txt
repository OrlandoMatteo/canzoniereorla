LAm            DO            
Come on skinny love just last the year
LAm           DO               
Pour a little salt we were never here
        LAm     DO           
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
               SOL4                        LAm   DO6
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer

LAm        DO
 I tell my love to wreck it all
LAm             DO
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
        LAm     DO
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
             SOL4                LAm
Right in the moment this order's tall

      DO
And I told you to be patient
      SOL/SI         FA/LA
And I told you to be fine
      DO
And I told you to be balanced
      SOL/SI         FA/LA
And I told you to be kind
           DO
And in the morning I'll be with you
            SOL/SI          FA/LA
But it will be a different "kind"
        DO
I'll be holding all the tickets
              SOL/SI         FA/LA
And you'll be owning all the fines

LAm            DO           
Come on skinny love what happened here
LAm           DO
Suckle on the hope in light brassiere
        LAm     DO
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
               SOL4                  LAm  DO6
Sullen load is full so slow on the split

      DO
And I told you to be patient
      SOL/SI         FA/LA
And I told you to be fine
      DO
And I told you to be balanced
      SOL/SI         FA/LA
And I told you to be kind
        DO
And now all your love is wasted?
     SOL/SI           FA/LA
Then who the hell was I?
        DO
Now I'm breaking at the britches
           SOL/SI          FA/LA
And at the end of all your lines

DO
 Who will love you?
SOL/SI    FA/LA    DO
 Who will fight?
           SOL/SI   FA/LA
Who will fall far behind?
 
Ooh, ooh
