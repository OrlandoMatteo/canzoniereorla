
SIb                    
Bike down, down to the downtown
            SOLm7                    SIb                         
Down to the lock down, boards, nails lie around
                MIb7+/9
I crouch like a crow
                FA4
Contrasting the snow
        SIbadd9/RE        MIbadd9
For the agony, I'd rather know
       SIb     FA/LA   MIbadd9     SIb
'Cause blinded I am blindsided

SIb               
Peek in, into the peer in
               SOLm7
I'm not really like this, 
             SIb
I'm probably plightless
             MIb7+
I cup the window
                 FA4
I'm crippled and slow
        SIbadd9/RE
For the agony
           MIbadd9
I'd rather know
       SIb     FA/LA   MIbadd9    SIb
'Cause blinded I am blindsided

MIb                       FA4
Would you really rush out 
MIb                       FA4
Would you really rush out
MIb                       FA4
Would you really rush out for me now?
MIb                       FA4  
Would you really rush out
MIb                       FA4
Would you really rush out for me now?
MIb                       FA4
Would you really rush out for me now?
MIb                       FA4
Would you really rush out for me now?
MIb                 FA4   MIb    FA4
Would you really ru----sh out ...for me now?
MIb    FA4
    ...for me now?
MIb    FA4      MIb
    ...for me now?

SIb 
Taught line, down to the shoreline
             SOLm7
The end of a blood line, 
              SIb
the moon is a cold light
                      MIb7+/9
There's a pull to the flow
                 FA4
My feet melt the snow
        SIbadd9/RE        MIbadd9
For the irony, I'd rather know
       SIb     FA/LA   MIbadd9
'Cause blinded I was blindsided
       SIb     FA/LA   MIbadd9
'Cause blinded I was blindsided
       SIb        FA/LA     MIbadd9     SIbadd9
'Cause blinded I was ..blindsided
