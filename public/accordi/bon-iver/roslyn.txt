 Up with your turret
                    REb MIbm9    SIbm MIbm9
Aren't we just terrified?
SOLb7+
 Shale, screen your worry
                         REb MIbm9     SIbm MIbm9
From what you won't ever find
LAb6              LAb7/4
Don't let it fool you
              
Don't let it fool you

Down
                REb          LAb
Down's sitting 'round, folds in her gown

SOLb7+               
 Sea and the rock below
                   REb MIbm9      SIbm MIbm9
Cocked to the undertow
SOLb7+
 Bones, blood and teeth erode
                    SIbm MIbm9     REb6 MIbm9
With every crashing node
LAb6                LAb7/4
Wings wouldn't help you
                    
Wings wouldn't help you

Down
               REb       LAb
Down fills the ground, gravity's proud

SOLb7+ 
 You barely are blinking
                   REb MIbm7/9     SIbm MIbm9
Wagging your face around
SOLb7+
 When'd this just become a mortal home?
     SIbm MIbm9      
Down
SOLb7+
 Won't, won't, won't, won't
LAb6               LAb7/4
Won't let you talk me
                   
Won't let you talk me
 SOLb7+
Down
             REb       LAb
Will pull it taut, nothing let out
