"Someway, baby, it's part of me, apart from me"
       SIbm7           SOLb7+
You're laying waste to Halloween
    REb
You fucked it friend,

It's on its head,
   SIbm7           LAb
It struck the street
  SIbm7              SOLb7+
You're in Milwaukee, off your feet
                                 
... and at once I knew I was not magnificent

SIbm   LAb     

SOLb7+                          SIbm  LAb
Strayed above the highway aisle
SOLb7+ SIbm       REb       LAb
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
                SIbm   SOLb7+ SOLb/LAb   REb
I could see for miles, miles, miles

REb                             SIbm7 LAb
3rd and Lake it burnt away, the hallway
SIbm                    SOLb7+
Was where we learned to celebrate
REb                              SIbm7     LAb
Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
     SIbm                 LAb    SOLb7+
That night you played me 'Lip Parade'
REb                                 SIbm7    LAb
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
       SIbm             SOLb7+
Saying nothing, that's enough for me
                                            
... and at once I knew I was not magnificent

SIbm   LAb

SOLb7+                             SIbm  LAb                       
Hulled far from the highway aisle
SOLb7+ SIbm       REb       LAb
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
                SIbm   SOLb7+ SOLb/LAb  REb
I could see for miles, miles, miles

Christmas night,
                      SIbm7
It clutched the light,
                    LAb
The hallow bright
 REb
Above my brother,
                       
I and tangled spines
   
We smoked the screen to make
           SIbm7       LAb
It what it was to be
       SIbm7         SOLb7+
Now to know it in my memory
                  
... and at once I knew I was not magnificent

SIbm   LAb

SOLb7+                             SIbm  LAb                       
Hulled far from the highway aisle
SOLb7+ SIbm       REb       LAb
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
                SIbm   SOLb7+ SOLb/LAb  REb
I could see for miles, miles, miles
