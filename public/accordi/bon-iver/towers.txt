For the love, Iʼd fallen on
       DO#m7  MI     LA7+/9
in the swampy August dawn
       DO#m7    MI        LA7+/9           SI
what a mischief you would bring young darling!
         DO#m7       LAadd9    SI
when the onus is not all your own
            DO#m7       LAadd9      SI
when you’re up for it before you’ve grown

DO#m7  LAadd9      MI

         DO#m7 MI     LA7+/9
from the faun forever gone
       DO#m7          MI/SOL# LA7+/9
in the towers of your honeycomb
      DO#m7           MI/SOL#    LAadd9          SI
I’d a tore your hair out just to climb back darling
            DO#m7            LAadd9 SI
when you’re filling out your only form
        DO#m7               LAadd9 SI
can you tell that itʼs just ceremon’
           DO#m7       LAadd9       SI
now you’ve added up to what you’re from

DO#m7  LAadd9


SOL                                   SIm       LA
 build your tether rain-out from your fragments…
SOL                               SIm     LA
 break the sailor’s table on your sacrum…
SOL                                 FA#/LA# RE
 fuck the fiercest fables, I’m with Hagen

        SIm7 RE                 SOL7+/9
for the love, comes the burning young
         SIm7            RE           SOL7+/9
from the liver, sweating through your tongue
             SIm            RE
well, youʼre standing on my sternum 
          SOL7+/9         LA
don’t you climb down darling
       SIm7            SOLadd9   LA
oh the sermons are the first to rest
         SIm7                SOLadd9     LA
smoke on Sundays when youʼre drunk and dressed
        SIm7              SOLadd9   LA
out the hollows where the swallow nests

SIm7  SOL
