How many sorrows
                    SIm
Do you try to hide
                       SOL
In a world of illusion
                           LA
That's covering your mind?

Cruel is the night

That covers up your fears
SOL
Tender is the one

That wipes away your tears
SIm
There must be a bitter breeze
                        
To make you sting so viciously
     SOL
They say the greatest coward
                             LA
Can hurt the most ferociously
                                 LA7/4
But I'll show you something good

Oh I'll show you something good
       SOL

You can make a start
          LA
When your crumbling world falls apart
