Love is a stranger

DO
Love is a stranger

In an open car

To tempt you in
                   FA   
And drive you far away
 
And I want you

And I want you

And I want you so
          DO        FA
It's an obsession
 
And I want you

And I want you

And I want you so
          DO
It's an obsession

DO
Love is a danger

Of a different kind

To take you away
                    FA
And leave you far behind
    DO
And love love love

Is a dangerous drug

You have to receive it
           
And you still can't
     FA
Get enough of the stuff

It's savage and it's cruel

And it shines like destruction

Comes in like the flood
                   
And it seems like religion
    
It's noble and it's brutal

It distorts and deranges
       
And it wrenches you up
                               DO
And you're left like a zombie

FA
 And I want you

And I want you

And I want you so
          DO
It's an obsession

     FA
It's guilt edged

Glamorous and sleek by design

You know it's jealous by nature

False and unkind
     DO
It's hard and restrained

And it's totally cool
   FA
It touches and it teases
                              DO
As you stumble in the debris

FA
 And I want you

And I want you

And I want you so
          DO
It's an obsession 
FA
 And I want you

And I want you

And I want you so
          DO
It's an obsession
FA
 And I want you

And I want you

And I want you so
          DO
It's an obsession...
