SIb
 Underneath your dreamlit eyes
REm                              SIb
Shades of sleep have driven you away
 
The moon is pale outside
    FA      LAm      SIb
And you are far from here
                               REm
Breathing shifts your careless head
                               SIb
Untroubled by the chaos of our lives
                    FA
Another day another night
          LAm          SIb    
Has taken you again my dear

Last night while you were
            REm
Lying in my arms
                              SIb
And I was wondering where you were
                                FA
You know you looked just like a baby
      LAm                     SIb
Fast asleep in this dangerous world
                       REm
Every star was shining brightly
                            SIb
Just like a million years before
                         FA
And we were feeling very small
     LAm          SIb
Underneath the universe
                      DO
And you know that I'm gonna be the one
          SIb
Who'll be there when you need
             DO
Someone to depend upon

               FA
