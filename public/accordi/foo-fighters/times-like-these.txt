RE              LAm7
I—I'm a one-way motorway
                  DO
I'm the road that drives away
MIm7             RE7
Follows you back home
RE                   LAm7
I—I'm a street light shining
                  DO
I'm a white light blinding bright
MIm7            RE7
Burning off and on

RE              LAm7
I—I'm a new day rising
                DO
I'm a brand new sky
             MIm         RE7    
To hang the stars upon tonight
    RE               LAm7
But I—I'm a little divided
             DO
Do I stay or run away
    MIm            RE7
And leave it all behind?
