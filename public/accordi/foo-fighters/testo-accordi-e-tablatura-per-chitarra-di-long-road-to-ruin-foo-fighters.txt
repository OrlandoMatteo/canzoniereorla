DO/SOL
  Hey now don't make a sound
                                  FA
Say hey have you heard the news today

One flag was taken down
                        DO/SOL
To raise another in its place

A heavy cross you bear
                           FA
A stubborn heart remains unchanged

No harm, no life, no love

No stranger singing in your name

LAm       SOL6/SI
Maybe the season
    DO/SOL               SOL6/SI
The colors change in the valley skies
LAm             SOL6/SI
  Dear God I've sealed my fate
DO/SOL
Running through hell
RE
Heaven can wait

FA
Long road to ruin
DO/SOL
There in your eyes
FA                    DO/SOL  DO DO/SI
Under the cold streetlights
LAm
No tomorrow
RE             FA
No dead end in sight

Let's say we take this town
                        FA
No king or queen of any state
                  
Get up to shut it down
                               DO/SOL
Open the streets and raise the gates

I know a wall to scale
                         FA
I know a field without a name

Head on without a care

Before it's way too late

        SOL4/SI        DO
Forever gone without a trace
       SOL4/SI         LAm7
Your horizon takes its shape
           SOL4/SI               LAm7
No turning back, don't turn that page

              SOL6/SI        DO/SOL
Come now, I'm leaving here tonight
                SOL6/SI        LAm7 *
Come now, let's leave it all behind

Is that the price you pay
