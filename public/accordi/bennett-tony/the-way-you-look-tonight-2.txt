 Someday,     when I'm awfully low
FA#m7              SIm
 When the world is cold
SOL6          LA7/5-
I will feel a glow
                 RE11   DO11
Just thinking of you
                LA7    RE   SIm7+  MIm7/9  LA11
And the way you look tonight

               RE  SIm7   SOL6
Oh, but you're lovely
          MIm7   LA7/9-  RE7+
With your smile so warm
               RE#dim   MIm7
And your cheek so soft
                 LA7/9-
There is nothing for me
       RE11       SOL6
But to love you
                 LA11 LA7/9- RE   
Just the way you look to-----night

SIm7+   MIm7/9   LA7


FA7+      RE7/9-  SOLm7        DO9
With each word your tenderness grows
FA7+        MI7    SOLm6+   DO11 DO7/9-
 Tearing my fears apart
FA7+     LAb7/4+
And that laugh
     SOLm7         DO7/9-  FA7+
That wrinkles your nose
                   LA7/4   LA7/5-
Touches my foolish heart

                     SIm7   SOL6
Keep that breathless charm
                  LA7/5-
Won't you please arrange it
            RE11  DO9
'Cause I, I love you
