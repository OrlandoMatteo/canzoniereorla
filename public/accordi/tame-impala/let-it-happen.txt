LA  FA#m  SOL#4 SOL#  

LA  FA#m  SOL#m  LA

             FA#m               SOL#4 SOL#
It's always around me, all this noise
   LA              FA#m        SOL#m       LA
But  not really as loud as the voice saying
              FA#m        SOL#4  
Let it happen, let it happen
            SOL#    LA
(It's gonna feel so good)
                   FA#m         SOL#4 SOL#
Just let it happen, let it happen


RE#m      SI            DO#
 All this running around
          FA#             RE#m
Trying to cover my shadow
         SI            DO#/FA
An ocean growing inside
            FA#
Now all the others seem shallow
RE#m      SI             DO#
 All this running around
        FA#              RE#m
Bearing down on my shoulders
      SI            DO#/FA
I can hear an alarm
        DO#
Must be morning


LA  FA#m  SOL#m  LA  FA#m  SOL#4 SOL#

LA                    FA#m                SOL#4 SOL#
 I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
LA                    FA#m           SOL#m  LA
 It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound
                    FA#m            SOL#4  
And when it happens, when it happens 
            SOL#     LA
(I won't be holding on)
                 FA#m          SOL#4 SOL#
So let it happen, let it happen


RE#m      SI             DO#
 All this running around
        FA#                  RE#m
I can't fight it much longer
            SI               DO#/FA
Something's trying to get out
         SI/DO#           RE#m
And it's never been closer
      SI            DO#
If my take-off fails
        FA#              RE#m
Make up some other story
         SI              DO#/FA
But if I never come back
        FA#
Tell my lover I'm sorry


LA  FA#m  SOL#m  LA  FA#m  MI/SOL#  LA

FA#m  SOL#m  LA  FA#m  MI/SOL#

LA                     FA#m
 I will not vanish and you will not scare me
SOL#m                  LA
Try to get through it, try to bounce to it
FA#m                   SOL#m
All the while thinking I might as well do it
LA                         FA#m
They be loving someone and I'm not that stupid
SOL#m                   LA
Take the next ticket to take the next train
FA#m               SOL#m
Why would I do it? And you wanna think that

LA  FA#m  SOL#m  LA  FA#m  SOL#m

Take the next ticket to take the next train
FA#m               SOL#m
Why would I do it? And you wanna think that...
