LA        RE

  RE
I tried so hard my dear to show 
                     LA
that you're my every dream
             
Yet you're afraid each thing I do 
                  RE
is just some evil scheme

A memory from your lonesome past 
      RE7        SOL
keeps us so far apart
    LA            
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
                        RE
and melt your cold cold heart
      
Another love before my time 
                        LA
made your heart sad and blue
            
And so my heart is paying now 
                    RE
for things I didn't do
             
In anger unkind words are said 
              RE7       SOL
that make the teardrops start
    LA                         
Why can't I free your doubtful mind, 
                        RE     LA   RE
and melt your cold cold heart

       RE
You'll never know how much 
                            LA
it hurts to see you sit and cry

You know you need and want my love 
                     RE
yet you're afraid to try
                             
Why do you run and hide from life, 
          RE7        SOL
to try it just ain't smart
    LA                         
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
                        RE
and melt your cold cold heart
    
There was a time when I believed 
                     LA
that you belonged to me

But now I know your heart 
                     RE
is shackled to a memory

The more I learn to care for you, 
            RE7    SOL
the more we drift apart
    LA                      
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
                        RE
and melt your cold cold heart
