MI  SI7  MI

MI                   
Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
                      MI7             
He sounds too blue to fly
    LA                MI
The midnight train is whining low
                SI7     MI
I'm so lonesome I could cry
                  
I've never seen a night so long
                        MI7     
When time goes crawling by
    LA               MI
The moon just went behind the clouds
            SI7      MI
To hide its face and cry

MI6  MI  MI6     LA7  MI    SI7 MI

        MI           
Did you ever see a robin weep
                     MI7
When leaves began to die?
     LA                MI
Like me, he's lost the will to live
                SI7     MI
I'm so lonesome I could cry

MI    MI7 LA  MI   SI7 MI

    MI
The silence of a falling star
                   MI7
Lights up a purple sky
    LA          MI
And as I wonder where you are
                SI7     MI
I'm so lonesome I could cry
