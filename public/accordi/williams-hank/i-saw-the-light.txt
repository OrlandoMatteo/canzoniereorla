  SOL                                  SOL7
I wandered so aimless life filled with sin
DO                DO7          SOL
I wouldn't let my dear saviour in
                                       
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
                RE        SOL 
Praise the Lord I saw the light
                          SOL7
I saw the light I saw the light
DO               DO7     SOL
No more darkness no more night

Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
                RE        SOL
Praise the Lord I saw the light

SOL  RE  SOL

SOL                               SOL7
Just like a blind man I wandered along
DO                                 SOL
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
                                           
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
                RE        SOL
Praise the Lord I saw the light
                          SOL7
I saw the light I saw the light
DO                       SOL
No more darkness no more night
         
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
                RE        SOL
Praise the Lord I saw the light

SOL     DO   SOL     RE SOL

SOL                           SOL7
I was a fool to wander and a-stray
 DO                                 SOL
Straight is the gate and narrow the way
                                    
Now I have traded the wrong for the right
                RE        SOL
Praise the Lord I saw the light
                          
I saw the light I saw the light
DO                       SOL
No more darkness no more night
                           
Now I'm so happy no sorrow in sight
                RE        SOL
Praise the Lord I saw the light

SOL   RE   SOL
