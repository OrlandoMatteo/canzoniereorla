My motivation is gone too soon
       LA6               LA
Good vibrations all over you
             RE6    RE
Act like you mean it
    RE6    RE
You mean it
          LA6             LA
You got a story you never tell
            LA6               LA
Down in the Delta I'm ringing bells
           RE6    RE
I've never seen it
RE6    RE
Seen it
           LA6            LA
Back of my mind I'm on my way
              LA6             RE
I see through smiles on every face
          RE6     RE
I don't believe it
  RE6     RE
Believe it
               DO#m
'Cause I'm the supersoaker

Red, white, and blew 'em all away

With the kisses unclean

As the words that you say

LA6     LA               DO#m
I don't mind sentimental girls, at times
                  SIm7 
Miss, don't walk away
      MI7
Walk away

The flags are flying across the Plains
               LA6           LA
I got a secret picking in my brain
        RE6     RE
I wanna see you
RE6     RE
See you
         LA6         LA
The exit sign is on my face
              LA6
Don't know my home
                LA
I don't know my place
             RE6      RE
I just wanna be there
RE6      RE
Be there
               DO#m
'Cause I'm the supersoaker

Red, white, and blew 'em all away
