L.A.'s fine, the sun shines most the time
MIb
 And the feeling is "lay back"
FA                   
Palm trees grow and rents are low
                              
But you know I keep thinkin' about
SIb
 Making my way back
                              
Well I'm New York City born and raised
     
But nowadays
                   MIb
I'm lost between two shores
FA
L.A.'s fine, but it ain't home

New York's home
                     SIb  SIb4  SIb
But it ain't mine no more

            SIb
"I am"... I said
          MIb
To no one there
           
And no one heard at all
     SIb/RE DOm7 SIb
Not even    the  chair
            
"I am"... I cried
               MIb
"I am"... said I
         
And I am lost and I can't
 SIb/RE DOm7 SIb    FA
Even    say  why
           SIb    MIb6/SIb  SIb  MIb6/SIb
Leavin' me lonely still

SIb MIb6/SIb   SIb MIb6/SIb

        SIb               MIb/SIb
Did you ever read about a frog
               SIb          MIb/SIb
Who dreamed of bein' a king
MIb
 And then became one
       FA
Well except for the names

And a few other changes

If you talk about me
SIb               SIb4    SIb  SIb4
 The story is the same one
    SIb
But I got an emptiness deep inside

And I've tried
                    MIb
But it won't let me go
    FA
And I'm not a man who likes to swear

But I never cared
                        SIb  SIb4  SIb
For the sound of being alone

           SIb
"I am"... I said
          MIb
To no one there
           
And no one heard at all
     SIb/RE DOm7 SIb
Not even    the  chair
            
"I am"... I cried
               MIb
"I am"... said I
         
            SIb
"I am"... I said
            MIb
"I am"... I cried
             MIb SIb/RE DOm7 SIb
"I am"...
