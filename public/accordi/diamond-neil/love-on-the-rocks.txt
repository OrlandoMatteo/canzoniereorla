LAm               FA
 Love on the rocks ain't no surprise
SOL
 Pour me a drink,
                  MIm
And I'll tell you some lies
FA
 Got nothing to lose,
       SI7                          MI   MI7
So you just sing the blues, all the time
LAm                FA
 Gave you my heart, gave you my soul
SOL                 
 You left me alone here
             MIm7 
With nothing to hold
FA
 Yesterday's gone

 First they say they want you
LA7+
How they really need you
SOL/LA
 Suddenly you find you're out there
RE/LA          FA   SOL  
 Walking in a storm

 When they know they have you

 Then they really have you
RE/LA              REm/LA
Nothing you can do or say,
       LA
You've got to leave, just get away

 You need what you need
FA
 You can say what you want
SOL                  SOL/FA
 Not much you can do
            MIm7
When the feeling is gone
    FA                  
May be blue skies above,
         SI7
But it's cool
                        MI     MI/RE MI/DO# MI7/SI
When your love's on the rocks
