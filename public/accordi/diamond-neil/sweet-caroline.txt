I'm your average ordinary everyday kid

Happy to do nothin'
   MIb/FA
In fact that's what I did
        FA5
I got a million ways to make my day

But daddy don't agree
       
'Cause when I try to get away
       
He says he got plans for me
   
Get your butt right out of bed

Stop buggin' me

Get up and move your sleepy head

Don't shake my tree
                     
(He said mow the lawn) who me?
                            
(Walk the dog) not my style, man
                         
(Take out the trash) no way
                           
(Tidy your room) c'mon get real
                    
Sorry dad, gotta disappear

DO5      FA5
I'm your average ordinary everyday dude

Drivin' with my baby

To get her in the mood

She's dialin' through my radio

And I'm ready to make my move

But what she got ain't rock 'n' roll

And it really blew my groove

It was Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven

It makes me want to scream
                            SIb  FA   
Bach, Tschaikovsky, violins
        FA5
Turn it off, that ain't my scene

Well I'm sorry girl

Here's my confession
FA5
 I suppose a rock's out of the question?
