 We saw the writings on the wall

When heathens ruled above us all
                             DO#5
Tormented we still heard the call
FA#5                
 You come to bring us down
                       
Wield the scepter steal the crown
                              DO#5
Time on the thrown is running out


SOL#5                     MI5
'Cause seasons change but we are still the same
SOL#5
 Even though the cold winds blow
      MI5            DO#5
We're burnin' like a flame

FA#5
 For years shunned by society

Outcasts condemned for our beliefs
                         DO#5
Our legions grew in secrecy
FA#5
 And now the time is here

I see the templars everywhere
                            DO#5
The freedom call is drawing near


SOL#5              MI5
 We hold our rebel banners up with pride
SOL#5
 The color's crimson
        MI5           DO#5
And the hammer is the sign
