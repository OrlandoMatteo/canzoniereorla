 Every night I have the same old dream
LAm                         SOL
'Bout you and me and what's in between
LAm LAm7    SOL/LA           LAm   SOL
    So many changes, so many lies
LAm  LAm7    SOL/LA
 Try to run, try to hide
LAm                     SOL
 From everything that I feel inside
      LAm             SOL/LA   LAm        SOL
But I can't escape you or your frozen eyes

DO SOL RE                      LAm
          Searching in the darkness
DO SOL RE                     DO SOL RE
          Fading out of sight
                  LAm         DO    SOL    RE
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night

 Another dark and empty night
LAm                     SOL
 If I was wrong I wanna make it right
LAm             SOL/LA      LAm   SOL
 But you are so distant, so far away
LAm         LAm7          SOL/LA
 Your words like ice fall on the ground
LAm                           SOL
 Breaking the silence without a sound
     LAm    LAm7    SOL/LA            LAm  SOL  
Oh familiar strangers with nothing to say
