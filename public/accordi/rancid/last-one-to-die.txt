 Everybody saying we gotta take a chance
    RE                            DO    
And telling me what the hell went wrong
SOL                    DO  
 We only listen to the words that we sing
      RE                   DO
Now a million are singing along

 No rules in a

Scandalous world
RE            DO
... a path to find
SOL        DO
 We sit on top of the world
          RE               DO   
And we’re proving it every night

And the good and the bad
               DO
There ain't no doubt

what it was all about
