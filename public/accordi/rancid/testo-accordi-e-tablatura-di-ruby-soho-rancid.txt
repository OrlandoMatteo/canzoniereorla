 One day in the year of the fox

Came a time remembered well
         FA                      SOL
When the strong young man of the rising sun
          LAm
Heard the tolling of the great black bell
DO              SOL
 One day in the year of the fox
         MI7           LAm
When the bell began to ring
          FA
Meant the time had cometh
    SOL
For one to go
       LAm
To the temple of the king
REm
There in the middle of the circle he stands
LAm
Searching, seeking
     SOL                   REm
With just one touch of his trembling hand
    LAm
The answer will be found
REm
Daylight waits while the old man sings
LAm
Heaven help me
    SOL                     
And then like the rush of a thousand wings
   MI7
It shines upon the one
        FA      SOL    LAm  FA  SOL  LAm
And the day had just begun

Far from the circle at the edge of the world

Thinking back from the stories he's heard
   LAm
Of what he's going to see
REm
There in middle of the circle it lies
LAm
Heaven help me
     SOL
Then all could see by the shine in his eyes
    MI7
The answer had been found

Back with the people in the circle

He stands
