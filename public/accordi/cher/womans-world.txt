            SOLm
I'm dancin' solo

In the dark on the club floor

I need to let it go

Shake it off stop thinkin' 'bout you

I lose myself in the beat of the drum

Tryin' try-tryin' to forget what you done done

But honey this is a battle that you haven't won
SOLm           FA SOLm
Torn up, busted,  taken apart
        FA SOLm 
I've been  broken down
          FA SOLm
Left with a  broken heart

But I'm stronger

Strong enough to rise above

This is a woman's world

I don't give a damn if you ever love me

Go-gonna lose myself in the beat of the drum
