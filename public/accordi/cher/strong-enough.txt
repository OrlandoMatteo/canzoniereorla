I don't need your sympathy
        LAb/SIb                MIb
There's nothing you can say or do for me
      DOm7           FAm7
And I don't want a miracle
LAb/SIb       MIb                
 You'll never change for no one
DOm7                FAm7      SIb7/4
 And I hear your reasons why
              MIb              DOm7
Where did you sleep last night?
            FAm7    
And was she worth it
        SOL7  
Was she worth it?


           REm7
'Cause I'm strong enough
   SOLm7
To live without you
DO
Strong enough

So you feel misunderstood
DO               FA
Baby, have I got news for you
         REm7          SOLm7
On being used, I could write the book
DO                   FA
 But you don't wanna hear about it
REm7             SOLm7
'Cause I've been losing sleep
DO               FA
 And you've been goin' cheap
REm7                 SOLm7           DO
 And she ain't worth half of me it's true
LA7
Now I'm telling you

 Come hell or waters high
DO            FA
 You'll never see me cry
