MI
 It started with a low light
                                         SI
Next thing I knew they ripped me from my bed
                      DO#m         SI
And then they took my blood type
                                   MI
It left a strange impression in my head

You know that I was hoping
                                             SI
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
                     DO#m   SI
But when they cut me open,
                        
I guess that changed my mind
        LA     SI
And you know I might
          DO#m      SOL#m7       LA         SI   
Have just flown too far from the floor this time
            DO#m             SOL#
'Cause they calling me by my name

        LA                  
And the zipping white light beams
SI             SOL#7/DO#      DO#m    SI  
Disregards the bombs and satellites
                           SI7
That was the turning point
                          MI
That was one lonely night

                        DO#m          MI
The star maker says, it ain't so bad
                        LA
The dream maker's going make you mad
LA6                 DO#m
 The spaceman says, everybody look down
SOL#              SI
 It's all in your mind

MI
 Well now I'm back at home, and
                                    SI
I'm looking forward to this life I live
                   DO#m      SI
You know its gonna haunt me
                             MI
So hesitation to this life I give

You think you might cross over
                                                   SI
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
                   DO#m    SI
You better look it over

Before you make that leap
        LA       SI
And you know I'm fine
      DO#m       SOL#m7    LA        SI      
But I hear those voices at night sometimes
     DO#m       SOL#
They justify my claim
        LA                 SI         
And the public don't dwell my transmission
         SOL#7/DO   DO#m    FA#m7
Cause it wasn't televised
                              SI7
But, it was the turning point
                      MI
Oh what a lonely night

 My global position systems are vocally addressed
MI                         DO#m             LA 
 They say the Nile used to run from east to west
DO#m                        LA SI            LA
