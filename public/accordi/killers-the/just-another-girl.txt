 Step out into the Indian dust
RE#m                                SI
 I can feel the cracks in my spirit
                    DO#   FA#
They're starting to bust
                              DO#/FA  LA#m7
Drive by your house, nobody's home
RE#m                               SI           DO#
 I'm trying to tell myself that I'm better off alone

FA#                    DO#             
 All of my friends say I should move on
RE#m                      SI
 She's just another girl, 
              DO#                       FA#
don't let her stick it to your heart so hard
                             DO#              LA#m7   
And of all my friends say it wasn't meant to be
RE#m                        SI     DO#          FA#  
 and it's a great big world, she's just another girl

I went to see a fortuneteller, that was a trip
DO#                           LA#m7          
Maybe this confusion's got me losing my grip
  RE#m
I can't believe you're out 
                               SIadd9  DO#7
there flying with somebody else
    FA# 
Now Jason's getting married in the blink of an eye
  DO#                     LA#m7
I got an invitation but I didn't reply
RE#m                                  
Tell your little brother that we put down the gloves
SIadd9         DO#7
  and give him all of my love

FA#                    DO#             LA#m7

 and it's a great big world, she's just another girl
           DO#             LA#m7          SIadd9
I could be reeling them in left and right
                  DO#                  RE#m
something's got a hold on me, tonight
           DO#               LA#m7            SI
Well maybe all of my friends should confront
                DO#7               FA#  DO# LA#m7
The fact that I don't want another girl

RE#m                   SIadd9          DO#

Now why can't I sleep at night
                  LA#m7            RE#m
and why don't the moon look right
                        SIadd9
the sounds up, the TV's on
                            DO#
