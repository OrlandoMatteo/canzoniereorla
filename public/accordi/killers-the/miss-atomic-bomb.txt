 You were standing with your girlfriends in the street
MIb                SIb      FA                      MIb SIb/RE
 Falling back on forever, I wonder what you came to beâ€¦

 I was new in town, the boy with the eager eyes
MIb            SIb       FA                       MIb SIb/RE           
 I never was a quitter, oblivious to schoolgirls' lies

 When I look back on those neon nights
            SOLm                FA
The leather seats, the passage rite
           MIb7+             FA7
I feel the heat, I see the light

Making out, we've got the radio on
             MIb              SOLm
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
             MIb              SOLm FA
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
       SIb
Racing shadows in the moonlight
            REm7
Through the desert on a hot night
          MIb               SOLm
And for a second there we'd won
              MIb          SOLm FA
Yeah, we were innocent and young

Cast out of the night, well you've got a foolish heart
        MIb                     SIb
So you took your place but the fall 
                    FA          MIb
from grace was the hardest part
   SIb 
It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back
            REm7
You run for cover but you can't escape the second attack
              MIb
Your soul was innocent, 
                       SIb
she kissed him and she painted it black
                FA
You should have seen your little face

             SIb

Racing shadows in the moonlight
            REm7
We're taking chances on a hot night
          MIb               SOLm
And for a second there we'd won
              MIb          SOLm FA
Yeah, we were innocent and young

The dust cloud has settled, and my eyes are clear
                 SOLm7            FA7          MIbadd9
But sometimes in dreams of impact I still hear

             SIb                 REm7
Miss Atomic Bomb, I'm standing here
               MIb
Sweat on my skin
         SOLm                  MIb
And this love that I've cradled
   SOLm    FA                 SIb
Is wearing thin (Miss Atomic Bomb)
                   REm7                MIb
But I'm standing here and you're too late
     SOLm             MIb   SOLm        FA
Your shock-wave whisper has sealed your fate
SIb
It feels just like a dagger buried deep in your back 

(It's so cruel)
            REm7
You run for cover but you can't escape the second attack 

(and you turn your back, you're so)
              MIb
Your soul was innocent, 
                       SOLm
she kissed him and she painted it black (on a losing game)
                MIb                    SOLm        FA
You should have seen your little face, burning for love,
                SIb
Miss Atomic Bomb...
