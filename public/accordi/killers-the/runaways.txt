REb         LAb              SOLb
Blonde hair blowin' in the summer wind
            REb           LAb
A blue-eyed girl playing in the sand
    REb       LAb           SOLb
I'd been on a trail for a little while
                 REb
But that was the night 
         LAb                    SOLb
that she broke down and held my hand
            SIbm            MIbm7
The teenage rush, she said, 
                 LAb              SOLb
'maybe I'll just runaway, we got time'
                SIbm
Well that ain't much...
         LAb         SOLb
We can't wait 'til tomorrow
          LAb            SIbm
You gotta know that this is real, 
     SOLb6       REb/FA
baby why you wanna fight it?
         SIbm      LAb/DO   SOLb
It's the one thing you can choose, oh!

LAb5 SIb5  SOLb

LAb      SIbm7         SOLb
We got engaged on a Friday night
               REb         LAb
I swore on the head of our unborn child 
     REb          LAb          SOLb
that I could take care of the three of us
                 REb       LAb
But I got the tendency to slip 
                    SOLb
when the nights get wild
           SIbm    MIbm7
It's in my blood
                        LAb               SOLb
She says she might just runaway somewhere else, 
           SIbm
some place good
         LAb         SOLb
We can't wait 'til tomorrow
          LAb            SIbm
You gotta know that this is real, 
     SOLb6       REb/FA
baby why you wanna fight it?
         SIbm      LAb/DO   SOLb
It's the one thing you can choose
             LAb
Let's take a chance baby we can't lose

                    REb  LAb   SOLb
Mean we're all just runaways
                          REb 
I knew that when I met you, 
              LAb       REb  LAb  SOLb
I'm not gonna let you ru--nawa--y
                             REb              LAb
I knew that when I held you, I wasn't lettin' go

           FAm
We used to look at the stars 
       SIbm
and confess our dreams
          SOLb
Hold each other to the morning light
REb                      SIbm
We used to laugh, now we only fight
LAb                   SOLbadd9
Baby are you lonesome now?
           REb       LAb           SOLb
At night I come home after they go to sleep
                 REb      LAb    
Like a stumbling ghost, I haunt these halls
          REb        LAb         SOLb
There's a picture of us on our wedding day
                REb
I recognize the girl 
      LAb                   SOLbadd9
but I can't settle in these walls

         LAb4        SOLb
We can't wait 'til tomorrow
                LAb       SIbm
No we're caught up in the appeal, 
     SOLb       REb/FA
baby why you wanna hide it?
         LAb     SIbm      SOLb
It's the last thing on my mind

(Why you wanna hide it?)
  LAb
I turn the engine over and my body 
                                 
just comes alive... 

                REb LAb SOLb
and we all just runaway
                          REb
I knew that when I met you, 
              LAb       REb  LAb  SOLb
I'm not gonna let you ru--nawa--y
                             REb              LAb
I knew that when I held you, I wasn't lettin' go
        REb
(No no no!)
                    SOLb     REb/FA  LAb   
(And we're all just runaways)
      REb 
Yeah runaway...
                    SOLb     REb/FA  LAb
(And we're all just runaways)

LAb5 SIb5    SOLb5
Yeah
