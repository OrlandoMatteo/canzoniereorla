Li---thium, don't want to lock me up inside
SIbm LAb MIbm 
Li---thium, don't want to forget how it feels without
SIbm LAb MIbm                              SIbm
Li---thium, I want to stay in love with my sorrow
LAb MIbm                        SIbm
Oh,   but God, I want to let it go

SIbm                       SOLb      
Come to bed, don't make me sleep alone
                  MIbm           LAb    SIbm
Couldn't hide the emptiness, you let it show
                   SOLb
Never wanted it to be so cold
                   MIbm             LAb
Just didn't drink enough to say you love me
SIbm    SOLb
I can't hold on to me,
SIbm          SOLb
Wonder what's wrong with me

sorrow

              SOLb          LAb       SIbm
Don't want to let it lay me down this time
SOLb     MIbm LAb SIbm
Drown my will to  fly
SOLb        FA         SIbm    
Here in the darkness I know myself
SOLb        MIbm         LAb    SIbm
Can't break free until I let it go

Let me go

SIbm                      SOLb
Darling, I forgive you... After all,
            MIbm           LAb SIbm
Anything is better than to be alone
                         SOLb
And in the end I guess I had to fall
               MIbm            LAb
Always find my place among the ashes
SIbm    SOLb
I can't hold on to me,
SIbm          MIbm
Wonder what's wrong with me

I'm     gonna let it go
