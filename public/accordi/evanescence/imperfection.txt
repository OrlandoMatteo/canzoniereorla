FAm

FAm
 The more you try to fight it

The more you try to hide it

The more infected, rejected, 

you feel alone inside it

You know you can't deny it

The world's a little more fucked up everyday

I'm gonna save you from it

Together we'll outrun it
                            FA
Just don't give into the fear
FAm
 So many things I would've told you

If I knew that I was never gonna see you again

                 FAm
I wanna lift you up 
    FA              FAm        FA    
into the light that you deserve
                  FAm
I wanna take your pain 
    FA         MIb/FA
into myself so you won't hurt

REb       FAm
Don't you dare surrender
REb             FAm 
 Don't leave me here without you
      REb  FAm           REb
Cause I...   could never
             MIb          FAm
Replace your perfect imperfection

FAm
 The way you look us over

Your counterfeit composure

Pushing again and again 

and sinking lower and lower

The world is on our shoulders

Do you really know the weight 

of the words you say?

You want a little of it

You just can't let go of it
FA
 You've got an ego to feed
FAm
 Too late to rise above it

Don't look now 

but the little girl's got a grenade
                   
I'm gonna lift you up 
    FA              FAm        FA
into the light that you deserve
                   FAm            FA
I'm gonna take you down to the real world 
           MIb/FA         FAm
so you can watch it burn

REb       FAm
Don't you dare surrender
REb             FAm 
 Don't leave me here without you
      REb  FAm           REb
Cause I...   could never
             MIb          FAm
Replace your perfect imperfection

FAm
 We stand undefined
MI5   FA5 SI5  DO5    SOLb5    FA5      
Can't be drawn with a straight line
FAm                       
 This will not be our ending
                      DO
We are alive, we are alive...

REb       FAm
Don't you dare surrender
REb             FAm 
 Don't leave me here without you
      REb  FAm           REb
Cause I...   could never
             MIb          REb
Replace your perfect imperfection
          FAm
Don't you dare surrender
REb             FAm 
 Don't leave me here without you

Replace your perfect imperfection
