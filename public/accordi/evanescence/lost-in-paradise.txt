DOm   LAb   MIb   SIb

DOm         LAb        MIb
I've been believing in something 
   SIb/RE     DOm      LAb  MIb  SIb
so distant as if I was human
    DOm         LAb        MIb
And I've been denying this feeling 
   SIb/RE  DOm
of hopelessness
    LAb    MIb   SIb
In me, in me

FAm7   LAb   DOm   SIb

FAm7     LAb        DOm  SIb             FAm7
 All the promises I made just to let you down
      LAb               MIb DO7
You believed in me, but I'm broken


REb  LAb          MIb
  I have nothing left
    REb    LAb          DOm  DO7     REb
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
           LAb         MIb      REb
We've been falling for all this time
    FAm     LAb        
And now I'm lost 


       DOm   LAb   MIb   SIb
in paradise

DOm   LAb   MIb   SIb

DOm        LAb      MIb
As much as I'd like the past 
SIb     DOm  LAb      MIb  SIb
not to exist it still does
    DOm        LAb         MIb           SIb
And as much as I'd like to feel like I belong here
    DOm     LAb    MIb    SIb
I'm just as scared as you


REb  LAb          MIb
 I  have nothing left
    REb   LAb          DOm   DO7     REb
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
           LAb         MIb      REb
We've been falling for all this time
    FAm     LAb         MIb     REb
And now I'm lost in paradise
   
FAm7      REb
Run away, run away
FAm        MIb             SIbm    REb
One day we won't feel this pain anymore
 MIb    FAm
Take it all the way
REb
Shadows of you
       FAm        MIb    SIbm   REb
'Cause they won't let me go...

     LAb          MIb     
So I have nothing left
    REb   LAb          DOm   DO7     REb
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
           LAb         MIb      REb
We've been falling for all this time
    FAm     LAb         MIb
And now I'm lost in paradise
 REb       LAb         DOm
Alone, and lost in paradise
