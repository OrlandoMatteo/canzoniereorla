It's true, we're all a little insane
    FA#m
But it's so clear
         RE    DO#
Now that I'm unchained

FA#m                 MI
Fear is only in our minds
FA#m                 MI
Taking over all the time
FA#m                 MI
Fear is only in our minds
         FA#m                 MI  FA#5
But it's taking over all the time

    FA#5                 MI5
You poor sweet innocent thing
FA#5                   RE5
Dry your eyes and testify
    FA#5                   MI5
You know you live to break me
FA#5                   RE5
Don't deny sweet sacrifice

FA#m
One day
             RE       DO#
I'm gonna forget your name
    FA#m
And one sweet day
                      RE      DO#
You're gonna drown in my lost pain

FA#m                 MI
Fear is only in our minds
FA#m                 MI
Taking over all the time
FA#m                 MI
Fear is only in our minds
         FA#m                 MI  FA#5
But it's taking over all the time

    FA#5                MI5
You poor sweet innocent thing
FA#5                    RE5
Dry your eyes and testify
    FA#5           MI5       FA#5     
And oh you love to hate me, don't you, honey?
               RE5  FA#5  SOL5  LA5  SI5
I'm your sacrifice...

FA#5  SOL5  LA5  SI5

       FA#5 SOL5      LA5   SI5
Do you wonder why you hate? 
        FA#5      SOL5       LA5  SI5    RE5
Are you still too weak to survive your mistakes? 

    FA#5                 MI5
You poor sweet innocent thing
FA#5                    RE5
Dry your eyes and testify
    FA#5             MI5
You know you live to break me
FA#5
Don't deny
             RE5    
Sweet sacrifice
