In a church by the face
                                 LA4   LA  MIm  MIm7  LA4 LA
He talks about the people going under
     MIm        MIm7  LA4  LA
Only child know

MIm                     MIm7
 A man decides after seventy years
             LA4 
That what he goes there for
        LA             MIm
Is to unlock the door
                             MIm7         LA4  LA  MIm
While those around him criticize and sleep
                               MIm7
And through a fracture on that breaking wall
      LA4                          LA          MIm
I see you my friend and touch your face again
                     MIm7        LA4  LA
Miracles will happen as we trip

DO                         SOL    RE
 But we're never gonna survive, unless...
              LA
We get a little crazy
DO                         SOL    RE

MIm                          MIm7
Crazy are the people walking through my head
            LA4                    LA        MIm
One of them got a gun to shoot the other one
                            MIm7
And yet together they were friends at school
LA4                    LA       MIm            
  Get it, get it, get it, yeah!
                                MIm7
If all were there when we first took the pill
     LA4                   LA
Then maybe then maybe then maybe then maybe
MIm                   MIm7        LA4  LA
 Miracles will happen as we speak
