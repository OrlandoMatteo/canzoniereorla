When you walk through the garden
                    
you gotta watch your back
                MIm7  
well I beg your pardon
                           SIm
walk the straight and narrow track
 
If you walk with Jesus
                          MIm7       
he's gonna save your soul
                    
you gotta keep the devil
                SIm
way down in the hole

                          SIm
He's got the fire and the fury

at his command
                       MIm7
well you don't have to worry
                    SIm
if you hold on to Jesus hand

we'll all be safe from Satan
                        MIm7
when the thunder rolls

just gotta help me keep the devil
                SIm
way down in the hole

SIm    MIm7   SIm   MIm7   SIm

               SIm
All the angels sing about Jesus' mighty sword
                       MIm7
and they'll shield you with their wings
                          SIm
and keep you close to the lord

don't pay heed to temptation
                           MIm7
for his hands are so cold
                  
you gotta help me keep the devil
        SIm
way down in the hole

down in the hole
            MIm7
down in the hole
            SIm
down in the hole...
