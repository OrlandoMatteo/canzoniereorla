    FAm
Well, you woke up this morning
SIb/FA
Got yourself a gun
FAm7                              SIb/FA    
 Your mama always said you'd be the chosen one
        FAm
She said, you're one in a million
             SIb/FA
you've got to burn to shine
            FAm7
But you were born under a bad sign
       SIb/FA
with a blue moon in your eyes
      FAm
And you woke up this morning
SIb/FA
All that love had gone
FAm7                          SIb/FA
 Your papa never told you about right and wrong
   FAm
But you're looking good, baby
         SIb/FA
I believe you're feeling fine (shame about it)
FAm7                         SIb/FA        
Born under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eyes

       FAm
Because you woke up this morning
SIb/FA                   FAm7    SIb/FA      
 Got a blue moon in your eyes
FAm
 Woke up this morning
SIb/FA                       FAm7   SIb/FA
 You got a blue moon in your eyes

FAm
Well, you woke up this morning
    
The world turned upside down
          
Lord above, thing's ain't been the same 

since Howlin' Wolf walked into your town

But you're one in a million, 

you've got that shotgun shine

Born under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eyes

FAm
 You woke up this morning
SIb/FA                   FAm7    SIb/FA      
 Got a blue moon in your eyes
FAm
 Woke up this morning
SIb/FA                       FAm7   SIb/FA   FAm
 You got a blue moon in your eyes

       FAm
When you woke up this morning everything was gone

By half past ten your head was going ding-dong

Ringing like a bell from your head down to your toes,

Like a voice trying to tell you 

there's something you should know

Last night you were flying but today you're so low

Ain't it times like these that 

make you wonder if you'll ever know

The meaning of things as they appear to the others
SIb/FA
Wives, mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers
          FAm
Don't you wish you didn't function, 
                                           SIb/FA
don't you wish you didn't think beyond the next paycheck

And the next little drink?
          FAm
Well, you do, so make up your mind 
                         SIb/FA
to go on 'cause when you woke up this morning

Everything you had was gone, everything you had was gone
FAm                   SIb/FA
 Woke up this morning
FAm                   SIb/FA
 Woke up this morning
FAm                                SIb/FA
 Woke up this morning, you want to be, 
                          FAm        
you want to be the chosen one tonight
                      SIb/FA
Yes, you know, because you just get help yourself
