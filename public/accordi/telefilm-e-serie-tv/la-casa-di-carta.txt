If I stay with you, if I'm choosing wrong
        MI/SOL#      MIm/SOL
I don't care at all
       SIm                 LA6
If I'm losing now, but I'm winning late
       MI/SOL#     MIm/SOL
That's all I want

Now we need some space, 'cause I feel for you
      MI/SOL#       MIm/SOL
And I wanna change
        SIm          LA6
Growing up alone, it seems so short
  MI/SOL#        MIm/SOL
I can't explain
   SIm                  RE7+                  SOL  MIm
Whatever happens in the future, trust in destiny
      SIm                  RE7+               SOL   LA
Don't try to make anything else even when you feel

                MIadd9  SOL7+
I don't care at all
   SIm    MI
I am lost
                SOL7+  MIadd9  SIm  MI
I don't care at all
SOL              LA                
Lost my time, my life is going on

of myself
          SIm              LA6          MI/SOL#   MIm/SOL
Cause now all I want is to be a part of my new world
   SIm                  RE7+                  SOL  MIm
Whatever happens in the future, trust in destiny

Why not have it all
   SIm   MI
I am lost
                SOL7+  MIadd9  SIm  MI
I don't care at all
