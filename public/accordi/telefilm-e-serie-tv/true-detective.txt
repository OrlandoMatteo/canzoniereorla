
LAm            MI7
From the dusty May sun
    REm            LAm
her looming shadow grows
              MI7
Hidden in the branches
       REm        LAm
of the poison creosote
    DO
She twines her spines up slowly
  SOL
towards the boiling sun
    REm
And when I touched her skin
   FA                       LAm
my fingers ran with blood

LAm            MI7
In the hushing dusk
        REm            LAm
under a swollen silver moon
               MI7
I came walking with the wind
   REm              LAm
to watch the cactus bloom
    DO
And strange hunger haunted me
    SOL
the looming shadows danced
  REm
I fell down to the thorny brush
    FA                        LAm
and felt the trembling hands

LAm           MI7
When the last light warms the rocks
REm                  LAm
  and the rattlesnakes unfold
                       MI7
The mountain cats will come
   REm            LAm
to drag away your bones
    DO
And rise with me forever
 SOL
across the silent sand
        REm
And the stars will be your eyes
        FA                     LAm
and the wind will be my hands
