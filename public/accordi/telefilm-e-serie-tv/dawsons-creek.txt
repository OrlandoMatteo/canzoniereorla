So open up your morning light,
    DO#m7/4      SI
And say a little prayer for right
         MI6/9             SIadd9/RE#
You know that if we are to stay alive
     DO#m7/4          SI
Then see the peace in every eye...

FA#

SIadd9

FA#                                        
 She had two babies, one was six months, one was three
SIadd9
 In the war of '44...
FA#
 Every telephone ring, every heartbeat stinging
         RE#m7          DO#          SI7+
When she thought it was God calling her
          RE#m7   DO#              SIadd9
Oh, would her son grow to know his father?

FA#                 DO#/FA    RE#m7       DO#
I don't want to wait  for our lives to be over,
  SIadd9             FA#/LA#            SOL#7/4 DO#
I want to know right now,  what will it be?

I don't want to wait  for our lives to be over,

Will it be yes or will it be...
   FA#
sorry?
SIadd9
 doo doo oooh doo ooh do do ooh

FA#
 He showed up all wet on the rainy front step
SIadd9
 Wearing shrapnel in his skin
FA#
 And the war he saw lives inside him still,
        RE#m7      DO#        SI7+
It's so hard to be gentle and warm
    RE#m7             DO#             SIadd9
The years pass by and now he has granddaughters

MI/FA#
 So breathe a little more deeply my love
       SOL#m7/9
All we have is this very moment
    LAdd9
And I don't want to do what his father,
                    
And his father, and his father did,
                  FA#
I want to be here now
