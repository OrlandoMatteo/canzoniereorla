
MIm             SI7              MIm
 When you came in, the air went out
           SI7           MIm
And every shadow filled up with doubt
LAm                    MIm
  I don't know who you think you are
      SI7                MIm
But before the night is through
        SI7                MIm
I wanna do bad things with you
                SI7            MIm    
I'm the kind to sit up in his room
              SI7                 MIm
Heartsick and eyes filled up with blue
LAm                        MIm
  I don't know what you've done to me
      SI7               MIm
But I know this much is true
        SI7                MIm
I wanna do bad things with you

Okay
     
LAm  MIm  SI7  MIm   

MIm  SI7  MIm

MIm           
  When you came in, the air went out
              SI7
And all those shadows there
MIm
  are filled up with doubt
LAm                    MIm
  I don't know who you think you are
      SI7               MIm
But before the night is through
         SI7               MIm
I wanna do bad things with you
           SI7                  MIm
I wanna do real bad things with you

Ow... ooh!

MIm  SI7  MIm    SI7  MIm

LAm                        MIm  
  I don't know what you've done to me
      SI7               MIm
But I know this much is true
        SI7                MIm
I wanna do bad things with you
           SI7                  MIm
I wanna do real bad things with you
