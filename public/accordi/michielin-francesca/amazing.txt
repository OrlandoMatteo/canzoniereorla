  Open my eyes
            REm/FA
look at the pale sky
REm            SOL/RE
  all has gone white
          REm/FA
can't even see
REm          SOL/RE
  the hidden sun
               REm/FA
the clouds are winning
REm            SOL/RE
  everything's still
             REm/FA
just you and me

         DO                  SOL
we can restart and shine as gold
              REm               DO
and when our dreams seem to be gone
              SOL
crashing the dusk into our dawn

Over the clouds always a gold sun
REm            SOL/RE           REm/FA
  it will come out, and light you up
REm        SOL/RE                 REm/FA           
  After tonight the fight will be over
