Come on, skinny love, just last the year
DO#m           LA                 MI   MI7+
Pour a little salt, we were never here
          DO#m  LA  MI                
My, my, my...
               FA#m                         DO#m
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
         LA              MI   MI/RE# 
Tell my love to wreck it all
DO#m            LA               MI
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
  MI/RE# DO#m  LA  MI
My, my, my...
             FA#m                  DO#m
Right at the moment, this order's tall

      MI
And I told you to be patient
      SOL#m          DO#m
And I told you to be fine
      MI
And I told you to be balanced
      SOL#m          DO#m
And I told you to be kind
           MI
And in the morning, I'll be with you
            SOL#m          DO#m
But it will be a different kind
               MI
'Cause I'll be holding all the tickets
              SOL#m          DO#m
And you'll be owning all the fines

DO#m            LA                 MI    MI/RE#
Come on skinny love, what happened here?
DO#m           LA                MI
Suckle on the hope in light brassiere
  MI/RE# DO#m  LA  MI
My, my, my...
       FA#m                         DO#m
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split

      MI
And I told you to be patient
      SOL#m          DO#m
And I told you to be fine
      MI
And I told you to be balanced
      SOL#m          DO#m
And I told you to be kind
         MI
And now, all your love is wasted
     SOL#m            DO#m
Then who the hell was I?
               MI
'Cause now I'm breaking at the bridges
           SOL#m           DO#m
And at the end of all your lies

MI
 Who will love you?
SOL#m     DO#m
 Who will fight?
MI                SOL#m  DO#m
 And who will fall far behind?

DO#m            LA  MI   MI/RE#
Come on skinny love

DO#m  LA  MI

 SI/RE#  DO#m  LA  MI
My, my, my...
 MI/RE#  DO#m  LA  MI  SI/RE#
My, my, my...
