FA#                              LA#m7
Just because I wander 'round the places we would go
       FA#7                           SI
Hoping that I'd run into you one last time
SOL#m7                         RE#m7
Just because I never took your picture off my phone
SOL#7/DO                             DO#7
Doesn't mean that you're still on my mind
FA#                         LA#m7
Just because I accidentally slipped 

and said your name
       FA#7                             SI
Well I heard your song, it makes me insecure
SIm/RE                         FA#/DO#       RE#m7
Just because I know I'll never ever feel the same
SOL#7          DO#7        FA#
Doesn't mean I love you anymore

     DO#        FA#
Am I lying to myself again
     LA#add9/RE           SI/RE#         FA#
When I say you're not the best I've ever had
     LA#m7      RE#m7
Am I lying to myself again
       SOL#9                           DO#7/4  DO#7
When I say that I'm not missing you so bad

FA#                
Just because I'm on my knees 
    LA#m7
and swearing I would change
           FA#7                          SI
And I'd do anything to hear you say "I'm yours"
SIm/RE                         FA#/DO#       RE#m7
Just because I know I'll never ever feel the same

Doesn't mean I love you anymore
