 I'm not surprised, not everything lasts
               SIbm           LAb7
I've broken my heart so many times
             REb
I stopped keeping track
            SOLb7+            MIbm7/9
Talk myself in, I talk myself out
                 LAb7           REdim MIbm7
I get all worked up then I let myself down
                REbadd9/FA
I tried so very hard not to lose it
MIbm7             LAb
 I came up with a million excuses
MIbm7         REb/FA                    SOLb  LAb               
 I thought, I thought of every possibility

                SOLb7+         LAb       REb
And I know some day that it'll all turn out
               SOLb7+         LAb             SIbm
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
      MIbm7       FA7
And I promise you kid
          SIbm         SI/REb      SOLb

  LAb                  REb

REb              SOLb7+                MIbm7/9
 I might have to wait, I'll never give up
                  SIbm7          LAb          REb
I guess it's half timing and the other half's luck
             SOLb7+             MIbm7/9
Wherever you are, whenever it's right
                   LAb              REdim MIbm7
You'll come out of nowhere and into my   life
                       REbadd9/FA    MIbm7
And I know that we can be so amazing
              LAb                      MIbm7
And baby your love is gonna change me
          REb/FA                 SOLb  LAb
And now I can see every possibility

                SOLb7+         LAb       REb
And I know some day that it'll all turn out
               SOLb7+         LAb             SIbm
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out

            REb/FA
But I won't need to fight it
      SOLb                   LAb
