REb           LAb
 I don't know why
               SIbm   
You think that you could hold me
         SOLb
When you couldn't get by
       REb
By yourself
                 LAb                    SIbm
And I don't know who would ever want to tear the seam
   SOLb
Of someone's dream
REb         LAb
 Baby, it's fine,
                        SIbm
You said that we should just be friends
             SOLb
Well, I came up with that line
        REb                    LAb
And I'm sure that it's for the best
            SIbm
If you ever change your mind,
      SOLb
Don't hold your breath
    SIbm             FA7/6- FA7
'Cause you may not believe,
 SIbm             FA7/6- FA7
That, baby, I'm relieved,
    SOLb
When you said goodbye,
   LAb7                REb
My whole world shined

                  LAb
It's a beautiful day and 
        SIbm             LAb4
I can't stop myself from smiling
         SOLb               REb
If we're drinking, then I'm buying
      SOLb              REb    LAb   REb
And I know there's no denying
                 LAb             SIbm
It's a beautiful day, the sun is up, 
            LAb4
the music's playing
            SOLb       REb
And even if it started raining
          SOLb             REb
You won't hear this boy complaining
           SOLb                 FA7          SIbm   LAb
'Cause I'm glad that you're the one who got away
                 REb
It's a beautiful day

REb              LAb
 It's my turn to fly,
                  SIbm
So, girls, get in line
                    SOLb                    REb
'Cause I'm easy, no playing this guy like a fool
          LAb
Now I'm alright
                SIbm              SOLb
Might've had me caged before, but not tonight
    SIbm          FA7/6-  FA7
And you may not believe,
      SIbm        FA7/6-  FA7
That, baby, I'm relieved
 SOLb                LAb              
This fire inside: it burns too bright
              SOLb7+
I don't wanna say "so long",
             LAb7               REb
I just wanna to say "goodbye"

                  LAb
It's a beautiful day and 
        SIbm             LAb4
I can't stop myself from smiling
         SOLb               REb
If we're drinking, then I'm buying
      SOLb              REb    LAb   REb
And I know there's no denying
                 LAb             SIbm
It's a beautiful day, the sun is up, 
            LAb4
the music's playing
            SOLb       REb
And even if it started raining
          SOLb             REb
You won't hear this boy complaining
           SOLb                 FA7          SIbm   LAb
'Cause I'm glad that you're the one who got away

       SOLb                   REb
'Cause if you ever think I'll take up
          SOLb               REb
My time with thinking of our break-up
            SOLb        FA7               SIbm  LAb
Then you've got another thing coming your way
                        REb  LAb  SIbm  SOLb
'Cause it's a beautiful day,
          REb
Beautiful day,
    LAb
Oh, baby, any day
            SIbm       SOLb
That you're gone away
             REb
It's a beautiful day
