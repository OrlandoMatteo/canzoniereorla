
  DO7+
I really can't stay

Baby it's cold outside
  REm7
I gotta go away
                  SOL7
Baby it's cold outside
     DO7+
This evening has been

Been hoping that you'd dropped in
        DO11
So very nice
              
I'll hold your hands they're just like ice
   FA            
My mother will start to worry
       
Beautiful what's your hurry?
   FA#m7/5-
My father will be pacing the floor

Listen to the fireplace roar
   DO
So really I'd better scurry

Beautiful please don't hurry
RE9                            SOL7
Well maybe just a half a drink more

I'll put some records on while I pour

    DO7+
The neighbors might think

Baby it's bad out there
    REm7
Say what's in this drink?
                      SOL7
No cabs to be had out there
  DO7+
I wish I knew how
         
Your eyes are like starlight now
              DO11
To break this spell

I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

Why thank you
  FA
I ought to say no, no, no sir
MIb6
Mind if move in closer?
   RE7                        SOL7
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
 
What's the sense of hurting my pride?
  DO7+         SIb6  
I really can't stay
           LA7
Baby don't hold  out
          RE7  SOL7 DO7+
Baby it's cold out--side

MIm7   FA7+  REm7 SIb7+/9  SOL11

Ah, you're very pushy you know?
I like to think of it as opportunistic

  DO7+
I simply must go

Baby it's cold outside
    REm7
The answer is no
                      SOL7
But baby it's cold outside
    DO7+
The welcome has been

How lucky that you dropped in
            DO11
So nice and warm

Look out the window at that storm
   FA
My sister will be suspicious

Gosh your lips look delicious!
   FA#m7/5-
My brother will be there at the door

Waves upon a tropical shore
   DO                     
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious

Gosh your lips are delicious!
     RE9                    
Well maybe just a cigarette more
SOL7                   
Never such a blizzard before

And I don't even smoke

DO7+
 I've got to get home

Baby you'll freeze out there
    REm7
Say lend me your comb
                          SOL7
It's up to your knees out there!
       DO7+
You've really been grand,

I feel when I touch your hand
              DO11
But don't you see?

How can you do this thing to me?
        FA
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
MIb6
Think of my life long sorrow!
   RE7 
At least there will be plenty implied
   SOL7
If you caught pneumonia and died!
 DO7+        SIb6
I really can't stay
              LA7
Get over that old out
          RE9
Baby it's cold
SOL7             DO7+     DO7/6
Baby it's cold outside...

Okay fine, just another drink then
That took a lot of convincing!
