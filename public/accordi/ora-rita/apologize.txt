    DOm
I'm holding on your rope
       LAb6              MIb   SIb/RE
Got me ten feet off the ground
        DOm
And I'm hearing what you say
      LAb6               MIb   SIb/RE
But I just can't make a sound
    DOm
You tell me that you need me
LAb6                    MIb      SIb/RE
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
    DOm 
You tell me that you're sorry
LAb6                   MIb       
Didn't think I'd turn around and say

          DOm               LAb       
That it's too late to apologize, 
     MIb     SIb/RE
it's too late
            DOm               LAb          
I said it's too late to apologize, 
     MIb     SIb/RE   DOm   LAb6   MIb   SIb/RE
it's too late

    DOm                         LAb6
I'd take another chance, take a fall
                MIb   SIb/RE
Take a shot for you
      DOm                           LAB6
And I need you like a heart needs a beat
                 MIb   SIb/RE
But it's nothing new, yeah yeah
  DOm                   LAb6
I loved you with a fire red, 
                 MIb
now it's turning blue
        SIb/RE  DOm
And you say     sorry like the angel
LAb6                       MIb
Heaven let me think it was you
         SIb/RE
But I'm afraid

          DOm               LAb       
That it's too late to apologize, 
     MIb     SIb/RE
it's too late
            DOm               LAb          
I said it's too late to apologize, 
     MIb     SIb/RE   DOm   LAb   MIb   SIb/RE
it's too late...

DOm   LAb6   MIb   SIb/RE

          DOm               LAb       
That it's too late to apologize, 
     MIb     SIb/RE
it's too late
            DOm               LAb          
I said it's too late to apologize, 
MIb  SIb/RE
yeah
            DOm               LAb          
I said it's too late to apologize, 
  MIb  SIb/RE

Got me ten feet off the ground
