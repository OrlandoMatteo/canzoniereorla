DO#            LA
Crawling in my skin
      MI                   SI    SOL#5
These wounds they will not heal
DO#           LA
Fear is how I fall
   MI             SI   SOL#5 DO#m  LA7+  MI  SI
Confusing what is real

DO#m           
 There's something inside me 
     LA7+
that pulls beneath the surface
MI        SI
 Consuming confusing
DO#m                         LA7+
 This lack of self-control I fear is never ending
MI          SI              LA7+
 Controlling  I can't seem
                SI
To find myself again
                     DO#m
My walls are closing in

without a sense of confidence 
        MI                
and I'm convinced that there's 
                          LA7+
just too much pressure to take
                     SI
I've felt this way before
       DO#m   MI
So insecure

 Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
MI          SI
 Distracting  reacting
DO#m                       LA7+
 Against my will I stand beside my own reflection
MI            SI
 It's haunting  how I can't seem
