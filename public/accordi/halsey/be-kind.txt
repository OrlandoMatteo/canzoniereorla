FA                  SIb      FA      
  When the sun shines on the mountains
                 SIb    FA
And the night is on the run
                SIb    FA
It's a new day, it's a new way
             DO     FA
And I fly up to the sun
              SIb      FA
I can feel the morning sunlight
                SIb      FA
I can smell the new-born hay
                 SIb    FA
I can hear God's voices calling
               DO        FA
From my golden sky-light way

FA         SIb
Una paloma blanca
                       FA
I'm just a bird in the sky
           SIb
Una paloma blanca
                    FA
Over the mountain I fly
           DO7              FA
No one can take my freedom away

       FA    SIb       FA
Once I had my share of losing
                    SIb  FA
Once they locked me on a chain
                   SIb      FA
Yes, they tried to break my power
                DO       FA
Oh, I still can feel the pain

FA         SIb
Una paloma blanca

No one can take my freedom away

No one can take my freedom away
