SOL#m         
Followed you down to the end of the world
                          
To wait outside your window
SOL#m7
In the heat of the rain I will call your name

But you just passed me by


   DOm
If you put me up like a fly on the wall
SIb
You'll be to blame when the heavens fall


SOL#m7/9
Give me a sign that you hear me call

But you just pass me by


    DOm
The colors around me are fading away
    MIb
And I'll be waiting come what may
     FAm7           DOm
I'll find you (I'll find you)

Yes, I'll find you (yes, I'll find you)
               MIb            SIb              DOm
If I've got to be the man who walks the earth alone


SOL#m7

SOL#m7/9
Followed the stars and I sailed to the sun

I held it in my fingers

Alone on the beach, on my own, out of reach

You just passed me by


DOm
Give you the world if you'd take my hand
        SIb
But you left me alone in the sinking sand


SOL#m7
Strike up the band for one last stand

Wherever you run I'll be on your tail
