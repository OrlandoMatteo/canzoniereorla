SIm              LA
Once upon a time I was of the mind
   SIm             LA
To lay your burden down
    SIm              
And leave you where you stood
    LA
And you believed I could
      SIm            LA
You'd seen it done before
SIm
I could read your thoughts
LA/SI
Tell you what you saw
    SIm         LA/SI
And never say a word
SIm
Now all that is gone
LA/SI               SIm        LA/SI
Over with and done, never to return

I   can tell you why
MI5    RE5  SI5
People die alone
MI5 RE5 SI5
I   can tell you I'm
  MI5    RE5    LA5    SIm  LA/SI  SIm  LA/SI
A shadow on the su------n

SIm
Staring at the loss
LA/SI
Looking for a cause
    SIm          LA/SI
And never really sure
SIm
Nothing but a hole
   LA/SI
To live without a soul
    SIm           LA/SI
And nothing to be learned

MI5 RE5 SI5
I   can tell you why
MI5    RE5  SI5
People go insane
MI5 RE5 SI5
I   can show you how
MI5       RE5    MI5
You could do the same
  RE5 SI5
I can tell you why
    MI5      RE5   SI5
The end will never come
MI5 RE5 SI5
I   can tell you I'm

SIm             LA
Shapes of every size
RE6            LA
Move behind my eyes
SIm             LA
Doors inside my head
RE6           LA
Bolted from within
SIm           LA
Every drop of flame
RE6             LA
Lights a candle in
SIm           LA
Memory of the one
    RE6             LA/MI
Who lives inside my skin
