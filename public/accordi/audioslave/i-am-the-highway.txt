Lord I've really been real stressed
RE#m          SOL#7/4
Down and out, losing ground
RE#m          SOL#7/4
Although I am Black and proud
RE#m            SOL#7/4
Problems got me pessimistic
RE#m                      SOL#7/4
Brothers and sisters keep messing up
RE#m                   SOL#7/4
Why does it have to be so damn tough?
RE#m               SOL#7/4
I don't know where I can go
   RE#m               SOL#7/4
To let these ghosts out of my skull
   RE#m               SOL#7/4
My grandma's passed, my brother's gone
  RE#m            SOL#7/4
I never at once felt so alone
  REm                       SOL#7/4
I know you're supposed to be my steering wheel
    RE#m          SOL#7/4
Not just my spare tire (home)
    RE#mm       SOL#7/4
But Lord I ask you (home)
   RE#m             SOL#7/4
To be my guiding force and truth (home)
    RE#m                  SOL#7/4
For some strange reason it had to be (home)
   RE#m        SOL#7/4
He guided me to Tennessee (home)

RE#m        SOL#7/4
Take me to another place
RE#m        SOL#7/4
Take me to another land
RE#m           SOL#7/4     
Make me forget all that hurts me
RE#m        SOL#7/4
Let me understand your plan
RE#m        SOL#7/4
Take me to another place
RE#m        SOL#7/4
Take me to another land
RE#m           SOL#7/4     
Make me forget all that hurts me
RE#m        SOL#7/4
Let me understand your plan

RE#m                 SOL#7/4
Lord it's obvious we got a relationship
RE#m                    SOL#7/4
Talkin' to each other every night and day
   RE#m               SOL#7/4
Although you're superior over me
   RE#m                  SOL#7/4
We talk to each other in a friendship way
     RE#m              SOL#7/4 
Then outta nowhere you tell me to break
RE#m                  SOL#7/4
Outta the country and into more country
RE#m          SOL#7/4
Past Dyesburg into Ripley
RE#m               SOL#7/4
Where the ghost of childhood haunts me
RE#m               SOL#7/4
Walk the roads my forefathers walked
RE#m                 SOL#7/4
Climbed the trees my forefathers hung from
RE#m                SOL#7/4
Ask those trees for all their wisdom
RE#m            SOL#7/4 
They tell me my ears are so young (home)
   RE#m         SOL#7/4
Go back to from whence you came (home)
   RE#m            SOL#7/4
My family tree, my family name (home)
    RE#m                SOL#7/4
For some strange reason it had to be (home)
   RE#m         SOL#7/4
He guided me to Tennessee (home)

RE#m        SOL#7/4
Take me to another place
RE#m        SOL#7/4
Take me to another land
RE#m           SOL#7/4     
Make me forget all that hurts me
RE#m        SOL#7/4
Let me understand your plan


Eshe? She went down to Holly Springs

Rasha Don and Baba? They went down to Peachtree

Headliner, I challenge you to a game of horseshoes

A game of horseshoes!

RE#m                SOL#7/4
Now I see the importance of history
RE#m                   SOL#7/4
Why my people be in the mess that they be
RE#m               SOL#7/4
Many journeys to freedom made in vain
  RE#m                SOL#7/4
My brothers on the corner playing ghetto games
  RE#m          SOL#7/4
I ask you Lord why you enlightened me
  RE#m             SOL#7/4
Without the enlightenment of all my folks
   RE#m             SOL#7/4
He said 'cause I set myself on a quest for truth
    RE#m             SOL#7/4
And you was there to quench my thirst

But I am still thirsty...

RE#m  SOL#7/4

    RE#m               SOL#7/4
The Lord allowed me to drink some more
   RE#m           SOL#7/4
He said what I am searching for
        RE#m                 SOL#7/4
Are the answers to all which are in front of me
    RE#m                SOL#7/4
The ultimate truth started to get blurry
    RE#m                SOL#7/4
For some strange reason it had to be
   RE#m                  SOL#7/4
It was all a dream about Tennessee

RE#m        SOL#7/4
Take me to another place
RE#m        SOL#7/4
Take me to another land
RE#m           SOL#7/4     
Make me forget all that hurts me
RE#m        SOL#7/4
Let me understand your plan

             SOL#m7            
Oh won't you let me
 
Won't you help me
                               RE#m
Won't you help me understand you plan?
        RE#m7 
Take me home

Take me home

Home
  
Take me to another place
        SOL#7
Take me home
  RE#m7                             SOL#7
Oh you know I need to go home, yeah

Tennessee

Te-Tenness...
