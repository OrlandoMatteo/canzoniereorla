FA#m   MI   RE   DO#7

FA#m             MI
 Right now, he's probably slow dancin'
       RE
With a bleached-blond tramp 
          DO#7
and she's probably gettin' frisky
FA#m             MI
 Right now, he's probably buyin' her 
     RE
some fruity little drink
           DO#7
'Cause she can't shoot whiskey
FA#m             MI
 Right now, he's probably up 
                  RE
behind her with a pool-stick
            DO#7               SI
Showin' her how to shoot a combo
             DO#7

  RE           FA#m
I dug my key into the side 
       RE                      FA#m
of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
RE               FA#m            DO#7
Carved my name into his leather seats
         RE                    FA#m
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
  RE                FA#m
I slashed a hole in all four tires
RE                    DO#7
Maybe next time he'll think 
         FA#m   MI   RE   DO#7
before he cheats

FA#m              MI
 Right now, she's probably up singing some
RE                        DO#7
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
FA#m              MI                        RE
 Right now, she's probably sayin' "I'm drunk"
                              DO#7
And he's a-thinkin' that he's gonna get lucky
FA#m             MI
 Right now, he's probably dabbin' on
      RE                    DO#7        SI
Three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo
                 DO#7
Oh, and he don't know

        RE
for the next girl
             SI                    DO#7
A-'cause the next time that he cheats
