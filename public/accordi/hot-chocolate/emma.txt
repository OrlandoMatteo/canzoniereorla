LA                         SOL
 We were together since we were five

She was so pretty
                   LA
Emma was a star in everyone's eyes
                                       
And when she said she'd be a movie queen
SOL
Nobody laughed

A face like an angel
                LA
She could be anything
            SOL
Emmaline  Emma, Emmaline

I'm gonna write your name 
                LA
high on that silver screen
             SOL
Emmaline  Emma, Emmaline

I'm gonna make you the biggest star 
                LA             SOL      
this world has ever seen... 

LA                    SOL
 At seventeen we were wed

I'd work day and night
             LA
To earn our daily bread
                              
And every day Emma would go out
    SOL
Searching for that play
                    LA
That never, ever came her way
                      
You know sometimes she'd come home
SOL
 So depressed
                     
I'd hear her crying in the back room
     LA
Feel so distressed
                            SOL
And I'd remember back when she was five

To the words that used to make
        LA
Emmaline come alive

It was:
            SOL
"Emmaline, Emma, Emmaline,

I'm gonna write your name high 
           LA
on that silver screen
           SOL
Emmaline, Emma, Emmaline

I'm g onna make you the biggest star

LA                        SOL
 It was a cold and dark December night
                      LA
When I opened up the bedroom door
 
To find her lying still and cold
 SOL
Upon the bed
                            LA
A love letter lying on the bedroom floor

It read:
             SOL
"Darling I love you,

But I just can't keep on 
           LA
living on dreams no more
                            SOL
I tried so very hard not to leave you alone
                     LA
I just can't keep on trying no more"
            SOL     LA
Emmaline...
                    SOL     
Aaargh, Emmaline...
LA            SOL          LA
Aaargh  Emma, Emmaline ...
         SOL     LA
Aaargh...  Emma, Emmaline ...
