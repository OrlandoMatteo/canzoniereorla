RE#m                            SIadd9  SI 
 Since we're feeling so anaesthetised
SI7+   SI6     RE#m
In our comfort zone
                         SIadd9  SI
Reminds me of the second time
SI7+    SI6          RE#m
 That I followed you home
                         SIadd9  SI  SI7+
We're running out of alibis
         SI6       RE#m
From the second of May
                         SIadd9  SI
Reminds me of the summer time
SI7+    SI6      RE#m  SIadd9  SI  
On this winter's day
SI7+           SI6    RE#m  SIadd9  SI
See you at the bitter end
SI7+              DO#  RE#m   
See you at the bitter end

                                 SIadd9  SI
Every step we take that's synchronized
SI7+  SI6     RE#m
Every broken bone
                          SIadd9  SI  SI7+
Reminds me of the second time
       SI6          RE#m
That I followed you home
                        SIadd9  SI  SI7+
You shower me with lullabies
          SI6       RE#m
As you're walking away
                             SIadd9  SI  
Reminds me that it's killing time
SI7+    SI6     RE#m    RE#m7 SIadd9  SI
On this fateful day

SI7+           SI6     RE#m   RE#m7 SIadd9  SI
See you at the bitter end
SI7+           SI6     RE#m   RE#m7 SIadd9  SI
See you at the bitter end
SI7+           SI6     RE#m   RE#m7 SIadd9  SI
See you at the bitter end
SI7+           SI6     RE#m  
See you at the bitter end

RE#m
From the time we intercepted

Feels a lot like suicide
SI
Slow and sad, grown inside us

Arouse and see you're mine

(See you at the bitter end)
RE#m
Love has seen your run-around

Who wanna seek you now?
  SI
I want a peace

I'd whine out

(See you at the bitter end)
RE#m
Love's reached his side

Grab this gentleness inside
SI
Heard a cry

Six feet down

In six weeks' time

The mess you left

Will end
                        RE#m
See you at the bitter end
