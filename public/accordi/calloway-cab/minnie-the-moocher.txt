Folks, here's a story about Minnie the Moocher
SI7               DO9      SI7           
 She was a lowdown hoochie coocher

 She was the roughest, toughest frail
           FA#m7/5- SOL6 LAm SI7      MIm
But Minnie had  a   heart as big as a whale

 She messed around with a bloke named Smoky
SI7                  DO9    SI7
She loved him though he was cokey
MIm7+/9              LAm6+    MIm
 He took her down to Chinatown
                  FA#m7/5- SOL6     LAm SI7 MIm

 She had a dream about the King of Sweden
SI7                      DO7     SI7
 He gave her things that she was needin'
   MIm7+/9                  LAm6+    MIm
He gave her a home built of gold and steel
      FA#m7/5- SOL6    LAm  SI7 MIm
A diamond    car  with platinum wheels

 He gave her his townhouse and his racing horses
     SI7                DO9   SI7
Each meal she ate was a dozen courses
    MIm7+/9 
She had a million dollars worth 
   LAm6+       MIm
of nickels and dimes
       
She sat around 
FA#m7/5-         SOL6  LAm  SI7 MIm     
and counted them all a million  times
