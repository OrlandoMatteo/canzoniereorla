MI       LA
 Here, have a dollar
            MI               LA
In fact, no brotherman here, have two
MI            LA
 Two dollars means a snack for me
       MI           LA
But it means a big deal to you
MI               LA
 Be strong, serve God only
                 MI               LA
Know that if you do, beautiful heaven awaits
           MI                LA
That's the poem I wrote for the first time
        MI                      LA
I saw a man with no clothes, no money, no plate
    MIadd9  LA7+
Mr. Wendal, that's his name
            MIadd9              LA7+
No one ever knew his name cause he's a no-one
              MIadd9               LA7+
Never thought twice about spending on a ol' bum
                MIadd9               LA7+ 
Until I had the chance to really get to know one
           MIadd9                      LA7+
Now that I know him, to give him money isn't charity
           MIadd9                 LA7+
He gives me some knowledge, I buy him some shoes
                 MIadd9               LA7+
And to think blacks spend all that money on big colleges
      MIadd9          LA7+
Still most of y'all come out confused
          MIadd9     LA7+  
Go ahead, Mr. Wendal...

MI          LA
 Mr. Wendal has freedom
            MI              LA
A free that you and I think is dumb
             MI                   LA
Free to be without the worries of a quick to diss society
MI             LA
 For Mr. Wendal's a bum
         MI                  LA
His only worries are sickness
                            MI                 LA
And an occasional harassment by the police and their chase
         MI         LA
Uncivilized we call him
               MI                   LA
But I just saw him eat off the food we waste
      MIadd9               LA7+
Civilization, are we really civilized, yes or no
MIadd9     LA7+
Who are we to judge
                   MIadd9            LA7+
When thousands of innocent men could be brutally enslaved
    MIadd9        LA7+
And killed over a racist grudge
    MIadd9           LA7+
Mr. Wendal has tried to warn us about our ways
    MIadd9         LA7+
But we don't hear him talk
          MIadd9           LA7+
Is it his fault when we've gone too far
               MIadd9         LA7+ 
And we got too far, cause on him we walk
    MIadd9     LA7+           MIadd9     
Mr. Wendal, a man, a human in flesh
        LA7+
But not by law
           MIadd9   LA7+
I feed you dignity to stand with pride
             MIadd9     LA7+
Realize that all in all you stand tall
    MIadd9      LA7+  MIadd9     LA7+
Go ahead, Mr. Wendal
    MIadd9     LA7+  MIadd9     LA7+ 
Mr. Wendal, yeah
          MIadd9     LA7+
Lord, Mr. Wendal...
