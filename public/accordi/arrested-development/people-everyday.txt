          REb7+          LAb   SIbm7         DOm7
See I was resting at the park minding my own
REb7+         LAb    SIbm7            DOm7
Business as I kick up the treble tone
      REb7+ LAb         SIbm7      DOm7
On my radio tape player box, right
     REb7+          LAb          SIbm7            DOm7
Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see?
      REb7+ LAb         SIbm7         DOm7
Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm dating
REb7+   LAb       SIbm7            DOm7
 Investigation maybe she was demonstrating
    REb7+ LAb     SIbm7        DOm7
But nevertheless I was pleased
   REb7+         LAb   SIbm7              DOm7
My day was going great and my soul was at ease
        REb7+         LAb         SIbm7      DOm7
Until a group of brothers started bugging out
             REb7+ LAb        SIbm7      DOm7
Drinking the 40 oz, going the nigga route
REb7+ LAb     SIbm7          DOm7 
  Disrespecting my black queen
REb7+         LAb          SIbm7        DOm7
Holding their crotches and being obscene
   REb7+     LAb                    SIbm7         DOm7
At first I ignored them cause see I know their type
         REb7+     LAb               SIbm7       DOm7
They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight
         REb7+       LAb             SIbm7         DOm7
And they see a young couple having a time that's good
          REb7+      LAb              SIbm7   DOm7 
And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood
        REb7+         LAb               SIbm7   DOm7
So they came to test Speech cause of my hair-do
        REb7+       LAb       SIbm7   DOm7 
And the loud bright colors that I wear
        REb7+           LAb     SIbm7   DOm7
I was a target cause I'm a fashion misfit
        REb7+           LAb     SIbm7             DOm7
And the outfit that I'm wearing brothers dissing it
       REb7+   LAb   SIbm7           DOm7
Well I stay calm and pray the niggas leave me be
        REb7+     LAb SIbm7                 DOm7
But they're squeezing parts of my date's anatomy
REb7+         LAb               SIbm7   DOm7      
Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me?
           REb7+        LAb                    SIbm7   DOm7

I told the niggas please let us pass, friend
        REb7+        LAb         SIbm7       DOm7
I said please cause I don't like killing Africans
       REb7+       LAb     SIbm7       DOm7
But he wouldn't stop and I ain't Ice Cube
       
But I had to take the brother out for being rude
           REb7+     LAb     SIbm7    DOm7
And like I said before I was mad by then
         REb7+     LAb        SIbm7        DOm7
It took three or four cops to pull me off of him
               REb7+     LAb   SIbm7      DOm7
But that's the story y'all of a black man
