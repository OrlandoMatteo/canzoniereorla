SOL       RE             DO
 I don't know where I'm going
SOL    RE                  DO
 But I sure know where I've been
SOL      RE/FA#    
 Hanging on the promises
   DO/MI          DO  SOL/SI LAm
In songs of yesterday
                    RE     LAm
And I've made up my mind,
                        RE      
I ain't wasting no more time
           MIm   LAm
Here I go again
DO          SOL  MIm  LAm   DO RE
 Here I go again

SOL       RE                    DO
 Though I keep searching for an answer,
SOL      RE                        DO
 I never seem to find what I'm looking for
SOL          RE/FA#
 Oh, Lord, I pray
            DO/MI             DO  SOL/SI LAm
You give me strength to carry on,
                       RE    
'Cause I know what it means
   LAm7                            RE      DO  RE
To walk along the lonely street of dreams

SOL         DO        RE    DO RE
Here I go again on my own
      SOL            DO             RE     DO RE
Goin' down the only road I've ever known,
       SOL        DO            RE     DO RE
Like a hobo I was born to walk alone
LAm7                  RE     LAm7
 But I've made up my mind
                        RE    DO RE
I ain't wasting no more time

SOL            RE/SOL          DO/SOL
 Just another heart in need of rescue,
SOL        RE/SOL         DO/SOL
 Waiting on love's sweet charity
SOL         RE/FA#
 I am gonna hold on
        DO/MI       DO  SOL/SI LAm
For the rest of my days,
