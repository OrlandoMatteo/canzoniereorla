LA             MI       FA#m7
Looking from a window above, 
            MI       RE
it's like a story of love
        LA   MI
Can you hear me
LA             MI     FA#m7
Came back only yesterday
           MI       RE
I'm moving further away
         LA   MI
Want you near me
RE                    MI
 All I needed was the love you gave
LA                 RE
 All I needed for another day
               MI
And all I ever knew
       LA
Only you

LA               MI/SOL#      FA#m7
Sometimes when I think of her name
          MI     RE
When it's only a game
       LA  MI
And I need you 
LA             MI/SOL#        FA#m7
Listen to the words that you say
             MI         RE
It's getting harder to stay
        LA MI
When I see you
RE                    MI
 All I needed was the love you gave
LA                 RE
 All I needed for another day
                MI
And all I ever knew
      LA
Only you

LA  MI/SOL#  RE/FA#  MI  RE     MI

LA  MI/SOL#  RE/FA#  MI  RE  LA  MI

RE                    MI
 All I needed was the love you gave
LA                 RE
 All I needed for another day
                MI
And all I ever knew
      LA  
Only you

LA                MI/SOL#    FA#m7
This is going to take a long time
      MI            RE
And I wonder what's mine
       LA     MI
Can't take no more
LA               MI/SOL# FA#m7
Wonder if you'll understand
              MI             RE
It's just the touch of your hand
         LA     MI
Behind a closed door
RE                    MI
 All I needed was the love you gave
LA                 RE
 All I needed for another day
               MI
And all I ever knew
      LA
Only you
