 I went away to see an old friend of mine
SOL/LA                RE
 His sister came over, she was out of her mind
         SOL7+/LA
She said Jesus had a twin 
         LA 
who knew nothing about sin
SOL/LA                      RE
 She was laughing like crazy at the trouble I'm in
    SOL7+/LA                 LA
Her light eyes were dancing, she is insane
SOL/LA 
 Her brother says she's just a bitch 
RE
 with a golden chain
    SOL7+/LA
She keeps coming closer saying, 
       LA
"I can feel it in my bones
SOL/LA            RE
 Schizophrenia is taking me home"

RE
 My future is static
FA#m
 It's already had it
LA
 I could tuck you in
RE
 And we can talk about it

I had a dream
FA#m
 And it split the scene
LA
 But I got a hunch
RE
 It's coming back to me
