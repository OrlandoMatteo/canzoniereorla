               RE      RE4
Just like Philadelphia
RE              SOLadd9
Freedom means a lot to me
      SOL/FA#  MIm7/4          SOLadd9           
In between the place I've been
                   RE  RE4 RE
And where I'm goin'
                  RE4  RE
I can see America
              SOLadd9
Tryin' not to show her age
     SOL/FA#   MIm7/4          SOLadd9
Even though the winds of change
           RE   RE4  RE
Keep on blowin'

            SOL
And I would lay your body down
              LA4        LA
And rock your tears away
         SOL
But it's much too late for now
           LA4        LA
To be like yesterday
        SOL
And the time is running out
    RE/FA#   MI
And we still have to say
    SOL7+
Goodbye
               RE      
Remember Philadelphia

               SOLadd9
When the world was young and warm
      SOL/FA#  MIm7/4     SOLadd9
So in love and living for
            RE  RE4  RE
Everything new
                          RE4  RE
But I know Philadelphia
           RE/FA#    SOLadd9      
The winter wind will slowly take
               SOL/FA# MIm7/4       SOLadd9
Your heart and soul  until it makes
               RE  RE4  RE
Nothing of you

            SOL
And I would lay your body down
              LA4        LA
And rock your tears away
         SOL
But it's much too late for now
           LA4        LA
To be like yesterday
        SOL             RE/FA#
And the time is running out
             MI
And we still have to say
    SOL7+
Goodbye

SIm7       
Flash a peace sign, take a bow
LA4               LA
Though we may not know it now
SOL                              SOL7+/9
Things are never gonna be the same
SIm7
Here on Seventh Avenue
  LA4            LA
I tip my old top hat to you
  SOLadd9                 SIm/FA#  MIm7
I hope you find somebody who
                   RE
Will love you like I do

            SOL
And I would lay your body down
              LA4        LA
And rock your tears away
         SOL
But it's much too late for now
           LA4        LA
To be like yesterday
        SOL             RE/FA#
And the time is running out
             MI
And we still have to say

Goodbye

Goodbye

Goodbye Philadelphia
