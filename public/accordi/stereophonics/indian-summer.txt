LAm  FA  DO  SOL

LAm                FA       DO
 Every time that I see her,
                           SOL   LAm
A lightning bolt fills the room,
                  FA     DO
The underbelly of Paris,
                        SOL   LAm
She sings her favourite tune
                           FA     DO
She’ll drink you under the table,
                        SOL   LAm
She show you a trick or two,
                      FA        DO
But every time that I left her,
                            SOL
I miss the things she would do
            FA       DO
She was the one, for me,
              SOL      LAm
She opened my eyes, to see,
            FA       DO
She was the one, for me,
       SOL
Well alright

       FA      DO
It was cold September,
           LAm    SOL
Before the Indian Summer,
           FA        DO
That’s the thing I remember,
         LAm       SOL
When she gave me a number
          FA         DO
Went from station to station,
     LAm              SOL
On a train ‘cross the nation,
        FA        DO
And the rain of November,
           LAm          SOL
That’s the time that we ended

            FA       DO
She was the one, for me,
     SOL
Oh alright

LAm              FA    DO
 Vodka with coca-cola,
                      SOL    LAm
Cocaine tucked in her shoes,
                FA      DO
Cigarettes over coffee,
                      SOL    LAm
Her halo slipped to a noose
                      FA     DO
Take the slow boat to China,
                            SOL   LAm
You fly it right ’round the moon,
                     FA        DO
She could take it or leave it,
                     SOL
I knew it had to end soon
            FA       DO
She was the one, for me,
              SOL      LAm
She opened my eyes, to see,
            FA       DO
She was the one, for me,
       SOL
Well alright

       FA      DO
It was cold September,

She was the one, for me,
              SOL      LAm
She opened my eyes, to see,
            FA       DO
She was the one, for me,
     SOL
Oh alright, alright, alright, alright, yeah
