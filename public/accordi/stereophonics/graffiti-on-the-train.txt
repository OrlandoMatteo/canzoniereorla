DOm
 Sets out he left his lover sleeping

Rain falls he's drowning in his secret
LAb
 Wet streets are quiet as a church hall

Last house where children kick the football
DOm
 Crossroads his heart is beating faster

Getting close to asking her the question
LAb
 "Marry me" he wants to paint the words on

The night train he's hiding with his spray can
  SIb
Tonight he's gonna ride
                                         FAm

 Day breaks his lover yawns and wakes up

Sips her cup and dusts her face in make up
LAb
 Platform she hears the people whisper

Someone died they surfed the train and slipped up
DOm
 Train comes the coach she's always used to

The doors read "Marry me I love you"
LAb
 Heart stops ecstatic and suspicious

She makes the call but he don't pick the phone up
    SIb
The train sped down the line
                                       FAm
