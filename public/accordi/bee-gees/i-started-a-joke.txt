Yo, Leroy

Ahh, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah

Why don't you hook up that def jam right about now?

Now I chill real ill when I start to chill

When I fill my pockets with a knot of dollar bills

Sippin' pints of ale out the window sill

When I get my fill I'm chilly chill

Now, I just got home because I'm out on bail

What's the time? It's time to buy ale

Peter eater, parking meter all of the time

If I run out of ale, it's Thunderbird wine

Miller drinkin', chicken eatin', dress so fly

I got friends in high places 

that are keepin' me high

Get down with Mike D And it ain't no hassle

I got the ladies of the eighties 
                                
from here to White Castle...

Yo, Leroy

It's my drum, it's my, hold it now, it's my rhyme

Now it's me, Adam Yauch, in the place to be

All the girls are on me 'cause I'm down with Mike D

I'm down with Mike D and it ain't no baloney

For real, not phony, O.E. and Rice-a-Roni

I come out at night 'cause I sleep all day

Well, I'm the King Ad-Rock and he's MCA

Well I'm cruisin', I'm bruisin',

I'm never ever losin'

I'm in my car, 

I'm going far and dust is what I'm usin'

Around the way is where I'm from

And I'm from Manhattan and I'm not a bum

Because you're pud-slapping, ball-flapping, 

got that juice

My name's Mike D and I can do that Jerry Lewis...

Yo, Leroy

Yo, that was real def man, try that again, man

I like that def stuff, boy

Hip-hop, body rockin', doing the do

Beer drinkin', breath stinkin', sniffin' glue

Belly fillin', always illin', bustin' caps

My name's Mike D and I write my own snaps

I'm a peep-show seekin' on the Forty-deuce

I'm a killer at large and I'm on the loose

Pistol packin', Monkey drinkin', no money bum

I come from Brooklyn 'cause that's where I'm from

Cheap-skate, perpetrating, money hungry jerk

Everyday I drink O.E. and I don't go to work

You drippy nose knuckle-head, 

you're wet behind the ears

You like men, and we like beer (beer, beer, beer)

Yo, Leroy

Bust that choco-lotto

What? Huh? Yo, man, 

pass that over here, man, alright

King of the Ave with the Def female

You're rhymin' and stealin' with the freshest ale

Kid coolin' at the crib watchin' my TV

Ed Norton, Ted Knight, and Mr.Ed

Pump it up homeboy, just don't stop

Chef Boyardee coolin' on the pot

I take no slack 'cause I got the knack

And I'm never dusting out 

'cause I torch that crack

The King Ad-Rock, that is my name

Y'all drinking MoÃ«t and we got the champagne

A quarter droppin', going shopping buying wigs

Surgeon general, cut professor, DJ Thigs...

Hold it now   ...hit it

Hit it

Hold it now
