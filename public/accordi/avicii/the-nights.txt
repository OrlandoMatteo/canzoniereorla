Once upon a younger year

When all our shadows disappeared
    DO#                        RE#m
The animals inside came out to play

Went face to face with all our fears
                      
Learned our lessons through the tears
     DO#                          RE#m
Made memories we knew would never fade
           SI
One day my father—he told me
            FA#
"Son, don't let it slip away"
   DO#4                             RE#m
He took me in his arms, I heard him say
              SI
"When you get older
                     FA#
Your wild heart will live for younger days
DO#4                        DO#
Think of me if ever you're afraid"

He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
           DO#             RE#m
So, live a life you will remember"
          SI                        FA#
My father told me when I was just a child
               DO#               RE#m
"These are the nights that never die"

"When thunder clouds start pouring down

Light a fire they can't put out

Carve your name into those shining stars"

He said, "Go venture far beyond the shores

Don't forsake this life of yours
