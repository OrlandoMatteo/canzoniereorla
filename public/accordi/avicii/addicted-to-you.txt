DO#m

             DO#m/SI           FA#7/LA#
I don't know just how it happened,
           LA7+
I let down my guard...
DO#m             DO#m/SI       FA#7/LA#
 Swore I'd never fall in love again
           LA7+
But I fell hard
DO#m            DO#m/SI           FA#7/LA#
 Guess I should have seen it coming,
                LA7+
Caught me by surprise...
DO#m                    DO#m/SI
 I wasn't looking where I was going,
  FA#7/LA#       LA7+
I fell into your eyes
SOL#
 You came into my crazy world 
     DO#m   DO#m/SI       FA#7/LA#
like a cool and cleansing wave
LA7+
 Before I, I knew what hit me baby 
         SOL#
you were flowing through my veins...

                DO#m
I'm addicted to you,
               DO#m/SI
Hooked on your love,
                FA#7/LA#
Like a powerful drug
                   LA7+   DO#m
I can't get enough of,
             DO#m/SI
Lost in your eyes,
            FA#7/LA#
Drowning in blue
          LA7+
Out of control,

What can I do?
                DO#m
I'm addicted to you!

DO#m            DO#m/SI              FA#7/LA#
 Midnight blows in through the window,
                 LA7+
Dances round the room...
DO#m         DO#m/SI
 Got me hypnotized,
            FA#/LA#        LA7+
I'm getting high on the perfume
SOL#
 I couldn't live without you now,
    DO#m   DO#m/SI LA#m7/5-
Oh, I know I'd go  insane,
LA7+
 I wouldn't last one night alone baby,

I couldn't stand the pain!

                DO#m
I'm addicted to you!
               DO#m/SI
Hooked on your love,
                FA#7/LA#
Like a powerful drug
                   LA7+
I can't get enough of,
             DO#m
Lost in your eyes,
            DO#m/SI
Drowning in blue
          FA#7/LA#
Out of control,
          LA7+
What can I do?
                DO#m  DO#m/SI  FA#7/LA#  LA7+
I'm addicted to you!
