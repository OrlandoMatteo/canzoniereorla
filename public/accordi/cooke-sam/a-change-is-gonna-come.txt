
      SIb                    
I was born by the river in a little tent
  DOm7
Oh, and just like the river
                 SOLm
I've been running   ever since
            SIb          DOm7     MIb
It's been a long, a long time coming

RE7  SOLm


But I know a change gon' come
   SIb
oh yes it will

It's been too hard living
                      DOm7
but I'm afraid to die

'Cause I don't know what's up there
SOLm
    beyond the sky
            SIb          DOm7   
It's been a long, a long time coming
      MIb RE7 SOLm
But I know     a change gon' come
   SIb
oh yes it will

  SIb                                DOm7
I go to the movie and I go down town
                          SOLm
Somebody keep telling me don't hang around
            SIb          DOm7
It's been a long, a long time coming
      MIb RE7 SOLm
But I know       a change gon' come
   SIb
oh yes it will

DOm7           SOLm        DOm7
  Then I go to my brother
                             SOLm    DOm7
And I say, "Brother, help me please"
               SOLm         DO9
But he winds up knockin' me
                FA7   
Back down on my knees

           SIb
There been times that I thought 
                          DOm7
I couldn't last for long
                           SOLm      
But now I think I'm able to carry on
            SIb          DOm7
It's been a long, a long time coming
      MIb RE7 SOLm
But I know      a change gon' come, 
   SIb
oh yes it will
