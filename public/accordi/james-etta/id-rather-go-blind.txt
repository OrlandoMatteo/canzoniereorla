LA

LA                        SIm7
 Something told me it was over
                      LA
When I saw you and her talking
                           SIm7
Something deep down in my soul said 'Cry, girl'
                            LA
When I saw you and that girl walkin' out

Whoo, I would rather...
                    SIm7
I would rather go blind, boy
                                   LA
Than to see you walk away from me, child
                                     SIm7                   
Whoo, so you see, I love you so much

That I don't wanna watch you leave me, baby

Most of all, I just don't...
             LA
I just don't wanna be free, no
                                  SIm7
Whoo, whoo, I was just, I was just, I was just..

Sitting here thinkin'...
                             LA
of your kiss and your warm embrace, yeah

When the reflection in the glass
          SIm7
that I held to my lips now, baby
                               LA
Revealed the tears that was on my face, yeah

Whoo, and baby, baby, I'd rather...
              SIm7
I'd rather be blind, boy

Than to see you walk away
                       LA
see you walk away from me, yeah
                                      SIm7
Whoo, baby, baby, baby, I'd rather be blind boy

Baby, baby, baby...
