I heard       church bells ringing,
 REb   MIb7     LAb    MIbm7 LAb7
I heard a choir singing
REb      MIb7      LAb      FAm
I saw my love walk down the aisle
       SIb7            MIb7
On her finger, he placed a ring, oh, oh
 LAb    SIbm7 MIb7   LAb    MIbm7 LAb7
I saw them    holding hands
        REb           MIb7    LAb  MIbm7 LAb7
She was standing there with my man
REb          MIb7         LAb         REb REbm
I heard them promise 'til death do us part
     LAb FAm    SIbm7 MIb7    LAb
Each word was a pain    in my heart

SIbm7 LAb7/DO
Oh... 
REb           MIb7                  LAb  FAm
All I could do, all I could do was cry
REb  MIb7          LAb   FAm
All I could do was cry
REb   MIb7       LAb        REb  REbm
I was losing the man that I loved,
    LAb FAm      SIbm7 MIb7 LAb  SIbm7 MIb7
and all  I could do     was cry

    LAb  SIbm7   MIb7     LAb   MIbm7 LAb7
And now   the wedding is over,
REb         MIb7                LAb   MIbm7 LAb7
rice has been thrown over their heads
REb        MIb7     LAb   REb REbm
 For them, life has just begun 
    LAb FAm SIbm7 MIb7 LAb
but mine is at     an  end

SIbm7 LAb7/DO
Oh... 
REb           MIb7                  LAb  FAm
All I could do, all I could do was cry
REb    MIb7      LAb    FAm
All I could do was cry
REb   MIb7   LAb           FAm
 I was losing the man that I loved,
    SIbm7       MIb7   LAb   FAm
And all I could do was cry...
