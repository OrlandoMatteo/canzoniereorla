RE SIm   RE SOL
   Love 
         SIm  RE SOL      RE
I get so lost  sometimes
SIm   RE SOL   RE       SIm       RE     SOL    RE
Days pass      and this emptiness fills my heart
SIm          RE SOL   RE   SIm       RE    SOL  RE
 When I want to run away I drive off in my car
SIm        RE  SOL      RE
 But whichever way I go
       SIm           RE      SOL
I come back to the place you are
LA               SOLadd9       LA
 All my instincts, they return
                SOLadd9  
The grand facade, so soon will burn
LA             SOLadd9            LA
 Without a noise, without my pride
                     SOLadd9
I reach out from the inside


        MI
In your eyes
                        LA/DO#
The light, the heat (in your eyes)
  REadd9          MI
I am complete (in your eyes)
                      LA/DO#
I see the doorway (in your eyes)
     REadd9                MI 
To a thousand churches (in your eyes)
                   LA/DO#
The resolution (in your eyes)
   REadd9            MI
Of all the fruitless searches (in your eyes)
LA/DO#        REadd9        MI
Oh, I see the light and the heat (in your eyes)
LA/DO#      REadd9     MI
Oh, I wanna be that complete
        LA/DO#               REadd9        MI
I wanna touch the light, the heat I see in your eyes

SIm  RE SOL  RE      SIm            
Love,        I don't like to see 
RE   SOL      RE
so much pain
SIm  RE SOL    RE        SIm             
So much wasted  and this moment 
         RE     SOL   RE SIm
keeps slipping away
      RE SOL      RE      SIm       RE      SOL
I get so tired working so hard for our survival
RE SIm      RE      SOL        RE
     I look to the time with you 
   SIm           RE   SOL   RE
to keep me awake and alive
LA               SOLadd9       LA
 All my instincts, they return
                SOLadd9  
The grand facade, so soon will burn
LA             SOLadd9            LA
 Without a noise, without my pride
                     SOLadd9
I reach out from the inside


        MI    LA/DO#   REadd9 MI  
In your eyes (your eyes,      your eyes)
        LA/DO#  REadd9
In your eyes
