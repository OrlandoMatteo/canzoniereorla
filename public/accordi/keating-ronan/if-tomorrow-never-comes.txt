   Sometimes late at night
                          MIb SIb  SIb4 SIb
I lie awake and watch her sleeping
       FA               DOm7
She''s lost in peaceful dreams
          FA                 MIb               SIb MIb SIb
So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
                        DOm7    FA
And the thought crosses my mind
                          MIb SIb   SIb4 SIb
If I never wake up in the mor-ning
FA             DOm7      FA
Would she ever doubt the way I feel
 MIb            SIb   MIb SIb
About her in my heart

               MIb       
If tomorrow never comes
                         SIb       
Will she know how much I loved her
                   FA     DOm7           FA
Did I try in every way to show her every day
     MIb      SIb       
That she's my only one
          DOm7    SIb/RE MIb
And if my time on earth  were through
                       FA      SOLm
And she must face this world without me
                              DOm7
Is the love I gave her in the past
      MIb          FA
Gonna be enough to last
                  SIb    FA MIb SIb
If tomorrow never comes

                                 DOm7   FA
'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life
                          MIb   SIb   MIb SIb
Who never knew how much I loved them
      FA              DOm7
Now I live with the regret
             FA                MIb          SIb   MIb SIb
That my true feelings for them never were revealed
                        DOm7   FA4
So I made a promise to myself
            FA               MIb      SIb  MIb SIb
To say each day how much she means to me
     FA              DOm7
And avoid that circumstance
                 FA               MIb            SIb MIb SIb
Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel

     DOm7  SIb/RE MIb
If tomorrow never comes
                         SIb       
Will she know how much I loved her
                   FA     DOm7           FA
Did I try in every way to show her every day
     MIb      SIb       
That she's my only one
          DOm7    SIb/RE MIb
And if my time on earth  were through
                       FA      SOLm
And she must face this world without me
                              DOm7
Is the love I gave her in the past
      MIb          FA
Gonna be enough to last
                  SIb    FA MIb SIb
If tomorrow never comes

                              DOm7
So tell that someone that you love
     MIb                  FA
Just what you're thinking of
                  SIb    FA MIb SIb
If tomorrow never comes
