
Intro:
DO    FA/DO    FAm/DO    DO

             DO
While she lays sleeping, 
  DO7/MI                             FA   DO/MI
I stay out late at night and play my songs
    REm7              SOL             MIm
And sometimes all the night can be so long
         LAm                         REm7
And it's good when I finally make it home, 
     SOL7/4
all alone
              DO
While she lays dreaming, 
                  DO7/MI           FA    DO/MI
I touch her face across the silver light
  REm7                SOL      SOL/FA MIm
I see her dreams that drift up to the sky
        LAm 
And she wakes up to my kiss
      REm7             SOL7/4
And I say it’s alright
      DO             FA/SOL
And I hold her tight

          DO4       DO
And she believes in me
                              SIm7 
I’ll never know just what she sees in me
MI7
 I told her someday
       LAm     LAm/SOL#     LAm/SOL    FA#m7/5- 
If she was my girl, I could change the world
REm7                SOL7/4
With my songs, but I was wrong
            DO4      DO
But she has faith in me
                      SIm7       MI7
And so I go on trying faithfully
                        LAm     LAm/SOL#
Forever in my heart she will remain
      LAm/SOL   FA#m7/5-    REm7       SOL7/4
And I hope and pray, I will find away, find away

             DO
While she lays waiting
                 DO7/MI        FA   DO/MI
I ask myself why do I hurt her so
     REm7         SOL       SOL/FA MIm
What calls me on along this lonely road
    LAm                               REm7
Why don’t I turn around and head back home
          SOL7/4
Where I belong
             DO
While she lays crying
                     DO7/MI             FA   DO/MI
For she knows how my heart is ripped in two
    REm7            SOL         SOL/FA   MIm
I’m tom between the things that I should do
LAm                            REm7
She deserves it all and I’d give it if I could
SOL7/4    DO  
 God, her love is true

          DO4       DO
And she believes in me
                              SIm7 
I’ll never know just what she sees in me
MI7
 I told her someday
       LAm     LAm/SOL#     LAm/SOL    FA#m7/5- 
If she was my girl, I could change the world
REm7                SOL7/4
With my songs, but I was wrong
            DO4      DO
But she has faith in me
                      SIm7       MI7
And so I go on trying faithfully
                        LAm     LAm/SOL#
Forever in my heart she will remain
      LAm/SOL   FA#m7/5-    REm7       SOL7/4
And I hope and pray, I will find away, find away

     DO       FA/DO   
While she lays...
      FAm/DO       DO
While she lays for me
