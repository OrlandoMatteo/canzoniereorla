LA

    LA              RE
The wretched desert takes its form
    LA             
The jackal proud and tight
                   RE
In search of you I feel my way
        LA
Through slowest heaving night
RE        RE4
 Whatever fear invents
  LA
I swear it makes no sense
SIm7                     SOL
 I reach out through the border fence
     LA
Come down, come talk to me
                        RE
In the swirling curling storm of desire
 LA                  
Unuttered words hold fast
                         RE
With reptile tongue, the lightning lashes
LA
Towers built to last
RE                  RE4      
 Darkness creeps in like a thief
    LA               
And offers no relief
    SIm7            SOL
Why are you shaking like a leaf?
     LA
Come on, come talk to me

   LA/DO#         RE
Oh please talk to me
          LA/DO#         RE
Won't you please talk to me
         LA/DO#        RE
We can unlock this misery
     MI               FA#m7
Come on, come talk to me
  LA/DO#          RE
I did not come to steal
     LA/DO#       RE
This all is so unreal
        LA/DO#            RE
Can't you show me how you feel?
         MI               FA#m7
Now come on, come talk to me
             RE
Come talk to me
             LA
Come talk to me

    LA                  RE
The earthly power sucks shadowed milk
     LA 
From sleepy tears undone
                     RE
From nippled skin as smooth as silk
    LA                
The bugles blow as one
RE                             
 You lie there with your eyes half closed
             LA
Like there's no-one there at all
          SOL
There's a tension pulling on your face
     LA
Come on, come talk to me

          LA/DO#         RE
Won't you please talk to me?
         LA/DO#       RE
If you'd just talk to me
  LA/DO#         RE
Unblock this misery
         MI           FA#m7
If you'd only talk to me
          LA/DO#           RE
Don't you ever change your mind
         LA/DO#        RE
Now your future's so defined
        LA/DO#          RE
And you act so deaf, so blind
     MI               FA#m7
Come on, come talk to me
             RE
Come talk to me
             LA
Come talk to me

LA
 I can imagine the moment
RE/LA                          LA
 Breaking out through the silence
                
All the things that we both might say
                                RE/LA
And the heart, it will not be denied
                               LA
'Til we're both on the same damn side
                  RE
All the barriers blown away

       LA/DO#         RE
I said please talk to me
          LA/DO#              RE
Won't you please come talk to me?
     LA/DO#          RE
Just like it used to be
     MI               FA#m7
Come on, come talk to me
  LA/DO#          RE
I did not come to steal
     LA/DO#      RE
This all is so unreal
        LA/DO#          RE
Can you show me how you feel?
         MI               FA#m7
Now come on, come talk to me
             RE
Come talk to me
             LA
Come talk to me
