SI FA#/SI SI                        FA#/SI SI                          
           Climbing up on Solsbury Hill
                     SOL#m FA# SOL#m
I could see the city light
                              FA# SOL#m
Wind was blowing, time stood still
                       SI FA#/SI SI  
Eagle flew out of the night
                           FA#/SI SI
He was something to observe
                         SOL#m FA# SOL#m
Came in close, I heard a voice
                               FA# SOL#m
Standing stretching every nerve
                       MI7+
I had to listen had no choice
FA#/MI    MI7+               
I did not believe the information
FA#/MI   MI7+            DO#m7/9
Just had to trust imagination
MFA#       DO#m7/9
My heart going boom boom, boom
    FA#      DO#m7
Son,    he said
          SI/RE#       MI      FA#      MI/SI  SI    
Grab your things, I've come to take you home

MI/SI SI FA#          MI/SI SI   MI/SI SI FA#
           Eh, don't quit

SI FA#/SI SI                           FA#/SI SI
           To keeping silence I resigned
                               SOL#m FA# SOL#m
My friends would think I was a nut
                        FA# SOL#m
Turning water into wine
                         SI FA#/SI SI   
Open doors would soon be shut
                          FA#/SI SI
So I went from day to day
                        SOL#m FA# SOL#m
Though my life was in a rut
                             FA# SOL#m
'till I thought of what I'd say
                          MI7+
Which connection I should cut         
  FA#/MI         MI7+
I was feeling part of the scenery
FA#/MI      MI7+                 DO#m7/9
I walked right out of the machinery
FA#           DO#m7/9
My heart was going boom boom boom
     FA#      DO#m7
Hey,    he said
          SI/RE#       MI      FA#      MI/SI SI    
Grab your things, I've come to take you home
MI/SI SI FA#         MI/SI SI   MI/SI SI FA#
           Yeah back home

SI FA#/SI SI                         FA#/SI SI
           When illusion spin her net
                          SOL#m FA# SOL#m
I'm never where I want to be
                         FA# SOL#m
And liberty she pirouette
                       SI FA#/SI SI 
When I think that I am free
                         FA#/SI SI
Watched by empty silhouettes
                                 SOL#m FA# SOL#m
Who close their eyes, but still can see
                            FA# SOL#m
No one taught them etiquette
                    MI7+
I will show another me
      FA#/MI  MI7+                  
Today I don't need a replacement
          FA#/MI        MI7+             DO#m7/9
I'll tell them what the smile on my face meant
   FA#     DO#m7/9
My heart going boom boom boom
    FA#       DO#m7
Hey,    I said
                SI/RE#              
You can keep my things, 
        MI      FA#     MI/SI SI   MI/SI SI FA#
they've come to take me home
