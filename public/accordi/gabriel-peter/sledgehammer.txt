you could have a steam train
           
if you'd just lay down your tracks
            
you could have an aeroplane flying

if you bring your blue sky back
              DOm
all you do is call me
                     MIb
I'll be anything you need
                
you could have a big dipper

going up and down, all around the bends

you could have a bumper car, bumping

this amusement never ends
