SI             RE                  MI
 All men have secrets and here is mine
   RE        SI
So let it be known
                         RE                  
For we have been through hell and high tide
        MI      RE    SI
I think I can rely on you...
            RE
And yet you start to recoil
      MI           RE      SI
Heavy words are so lightly thrown
                      RE         MI        RE       SI    
But still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you

         MI                 FA#    LA  SI
So, what difference does it make?
         MI                 FA#    LA
So, what difference does it make?
SOL#m     MI   FA#
 It makes none
  SOL#m          MI
But now you have gone
FA#     SOL#m           MI   FA#   SI
And you must be looking very old tonight

          RE                 MI   RE       SI
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
              RE
I stole and I lied, and why?
  MI        RE       SI
Because you asked me to!
                    RE
But now you make me feel so ashamed
             MI   RE      SI
Because I've only got two hands
                        RE      MI  RE  SI
Well, I'm still fond of you, oh-ho-oh

         MI                 FA#    LA  SI
So, what difference does it make?
         MI                 FA#    LA
So, what difference does it make?
SOL#m     MI   FA#
 It makes none
  SOL#m          MI
But now you have gone
FA#      SOL#m           MI       FA#    SI
And your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight

          RE                 MI   RE       SI
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
              RE

Because I've only got two hands
                        RE      MI  RE  SI
Well, I'm still fond of you, oh-ho-oh
    MI           FA#   LA
But no more apologies
   SI       MI        FA#   LA
No more, no more apologies
  SOL#m     MI   FA#
Oh, I'm too tired
SOL#m           MI
I'm so sick and tired
FA#     SOL#m        MI        FA#   SI
And I'm feeling very sick and ill today
                      RE      MI   RE 
But I'm still fond of you, oh-ho-oh

SI    RE  MI RE SI

              RE   MI RE
Oh, my sacred one...
SI    RE  MI RE
Oh...
