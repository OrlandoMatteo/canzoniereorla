DO  SOLm7  MIb  FA  LA  SOL

DO           SOLm7
Stop me, oh, stop me
MIb     
Stop me if you think 
            FA
that you've heard this one before
DO           SOLm7
Stop me, oh, stop me
MIb
Stop me if you think 
            FA                  DO
that you've heard this one before

          SOLm7
Nothing's changed
             MIb                    FA
I still love you, oh, I still love you
     DO
Only slightly, 
          SOLm7           MIb         FA
only slightly less than I used to, my love

DO                   SOLm7
I was delayed, I was way-laid
    MIb
An emergency stop
            FA                  DO
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
                      SOLm7
I crashed down on the crossbar
        MIb                       FA
And the pain was enough to make a shy, 
                 DO
bald, Buddhist reflect
                SOLm7
And plan a mass murder
    MIb              FA
Who said I'd lied to her?
    DO                          SOLm7
Oh, who said I'd lied because I never? 

I never
MIb                         FA
Who said I'd lied because I never?


LAbadd9    DOm7/9    LAbadd9    SIb  SOL


DO                    SOLm7
I was detained, I was restrained
             MIb
And broke my spleen and broke my knee
            FA
And then he really laced into me
DO                  SOLm7
Friday night in-out patients
    MIb              FA
Who said I'd lied to her?
    DO
Oh, who said I'd lied? 
          SOLm7
Because I never, I never
MIb                          FA
Who said I'd lied? Because I never
    DO
And so I drank one
     SOLm7
It became four
           MIb
And when I fell on the floor
        FA
I drank more


LAbadd9    DOm7/9    LAbadd9    SIb  SOL


DO           SOLm7
Stop me, oh, stop me
MIb
Stop me if you think 
            FA
that you've heard this one before
DO           SOLm7
Stop me, oh, stop me
MIb
Stop me if you think 
            FA                 DO
that you've heard this one before
          SOLm7
Nothing's changed
             MIb                   FA
I still love you, oh, I still love you
     DO                  SOLm7
Only slightly, only slightly less 
       MIb         FA
than I used to, my love

DO  SOLm7  MIb  FA  DO  SOLm7  MIb  FA

DO  SOLm7  MIb  FA  LA  SOL  SOL7
