FA                          DO/MI
  It's been seven hours and fifteen days
REm                             FA   DO/MI
  since you took your love away
FA                         DO/MI
  I go out every night and sleep all day
REm                             FA   DO/MI
  since you took your love away
FA                                    DO/MI
  since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
REm                          FA   DO/MI
  I can see whoever I choose
FA                               DO/MI
  I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
    REm
But nothing
                         LA7
I said nothing can take away these blues,

       MIb        SIb
'Cause nothing compares
MIb          SIb      DO
  nothing compares to you

FA                        DO/MI
  It's been so lonely without you here
REm                          FA   DO/MI
  like a bird without a song
FA
  nothing can stop
             DO/MI
these lonely tears from falling
        REm                     SIb
tell me baby, oh where did I go wrong?
FA                                 DO/MI
  I could put my arms around every boy I see
REm                                FA   DO/MI
  but they'd only remind me of you
FA
  I went to the doctor
              DO/MI
guess what he told me-guess what he told me
        REm
he said girl you better try to have fun
          LA7
no matter what you do, but he's a fool

       MIb        SIb
'Cause nothing compares
REm          DO
  nothing compares to you

FA
All the flowers that you planted momma
DO/MI
  in the backyard
REm                      FA   DO/MI
  all died when you went
FA
  I know that living with you baby
    DO/MI
was sometimes hard
REm                                  LA7
  but I'm willing to give it another try

       MIb        SIb
'Cause nothing compares
REm          DO
  nothing compares to you
MIb        SIb
Nothing compares
REm          DO
  nothing compares to you
MIb        SIb
Nothing compares
REm          DO
  nothing compares to you
