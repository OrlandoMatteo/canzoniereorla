REm  DO/MI FA   LAm   SOL/SI SOL     x2

            REm DO/MI FA     
The cycle repe-----ated
     LAm               SOL/SI SOL
as explosions broke in the sky
           REm DO/MI FA    
all that I nee-----ded
        LAm             SOL/SI SOL
was the one thing I couldn't find
        FA      
And you were there at the turn
REm7              SOL4  SOL
Waiting to let me know

                  REm  DO/MI FA                  
We're building it up
                 LAm  SOL/SI SOL                 
To break it back down
                  REm  DO/MI  FA                     
We're building it up
                 LAm 
To burn it down
              SOL/SI    
We can't wait
   SOL            REm                   
To burn it to the ground

DO/MI FA   LAm  SOL/SI SOL 

               REm DO/MI FA                
The colors confli------cted
       LAm                 SOL/SI SOL
as the flames climbed into the clouds
            REm DO/MI FA            
I wanted to fix---- this  
             LAm       SOL/SI     SOL
but couldn't stop from tearing it down
        FA              
And you were there at the turn
REm                   SOL4 SOL
caught in the burning glow
      FA           
And I was there at the turn
REm7               SOL4  SOL
Waiting to let you know

We're building it up
                 LAm 
To burn it down
              SOL/SI    
We can't wait
   SOL            REm                       
To burn it to the ground
                  
            REm                                  
You told me yes   You held me high
         LAm                  
And I believed when you told that lie
              DO                                
I played that soldier   You played king
              SOL                             
And struck me down when I kissed that ring
              REm                                  
You lost that right   to hold that crown
            LAm                       
I built you up but you let me down
            DO                              
so when you fall  I'll take my turn
            SOL                         
and fan the flames as your blazes burn

             REm              DO/MI              
And you were there at the turn
