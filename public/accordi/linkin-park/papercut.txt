DO#m            
Why does it feel like night today?

Somethin' in here's not right today

Why am I so uptight today?

Paranoia's all I got left

I don't know what stressed me first

Or how the pressure was fed

But I know just what it feels like

To have a voice in the back of my head

Like a face that I hold inside

A face that awakes when I close my eyes

A face watches every time I lie

A face that laughs every time I fall

(And watches everything)

So I know that when it's time to sink or swim

That the face inside is here in me

Right underneath my skin

            DO#m          MIadd9
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
           DO#m      MIadd9
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
           DO#m             MIadd9
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
              DO#m
It's like the face inside 
   MIadd9   
is right beneath my skin

DO#m
I know I've got a face in me

Points out all my mistakes to me

You've got a face on the inside too

And your paranoia's probably worse

I don't know what set me off first

But I know what I can't stand

Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is

I can't add up to what you can

But everybody has a face that they hold inside

A face that awakes when I close my eyes

A face watches every time they lie

A face that laughs every time they fall

(And watches everything)

So you know that when it's time to sink or swim

That the face inside is watchin' you too

Right inside your skin
