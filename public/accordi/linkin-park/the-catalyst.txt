God bless us everyone,

We're a broken people living under loaded gun
       
And it can't be outfought,
   
It can't be outdone,
   
It can't be outmatched,
   
It can't be outrun...

Transmissions echoing away,

Far from the world of you and I,

Where oceans bleed into the sky!

 God save us everyone,

Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?

For the sins of our hands,

The sins of our tongues,

The sins of our fathers,

The sins of our young

No!
