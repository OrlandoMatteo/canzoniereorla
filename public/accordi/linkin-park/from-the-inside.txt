SI                  LA7+         FA#m7                
I don't know who to trust, no surprise
                       DO#m            
Everyone feels so far away from me
SI                          LA7+         FA#m7
Heavy thoughts sift through dust and the lies
DO#m
Trying not to break, 
           SI
but I'm so tired of this deceit
      LA7+                 
Every time I try to make myself 
    FA#m7
get back up on my feet
           DO#m
All I ever think about is this
        SI
All the tiring time between
        LA7+             
And how trying to put my trust in you
     SOL#7/4
Just takes so much out of me

DO#5      MI5            LA5
Take everything from the inside
    FA#5     SOL#5 DO#5
And throw it all  away
         MI5           LA5
'Cause I swear for the last time
        FA#5    SOL#5     DO#m
I won't trust myself with you

SI                    LA7+        FA#m7
Tension is building inside, steadily
