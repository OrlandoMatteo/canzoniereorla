Take me down to the river bend

Take me down to the fighting end
SI
Wash the poison from off my skin
DO#m
Show me how to be whole again

Fly me up on a silver wing

Past the black where the sirens sing
SI
Warm me up in a nova's glow
    DO#m
And drop me down to the dream below

           LA     MI            SI        DO#m
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
       LA       MI               SI
Hardly anything there for you to see
           DO#m  SI FA#5  DO#m  SI FA#5
For you to see

DO#m
Bring me home in a blinding dream,

Through the secrets that I have seen
SI
Wash the sorrow from off my skin
    DO#m
And show me how to be whole again
