When this began
      SOLb7+
I had nothing to say
          LAb6                      MIbm9
And I get lost in the nothingness inside of me
          SIbm7
(I was confused)
                 SOLb7+
And I let it all out to find
         LAb6
That I'm not the only person 
           MIbm9            SIbm7
with these things in mind
                              SOLb7+
But all that they can see the words revealed
         LAb6                        MIbm9
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
            SIbm7
(Nothing to lose)
            SOLb7+
Just stuck, hollow and alone
        LAb                      MIb5
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

        SIb           REbadd9
I wanna heal, I wanna feel what 
  SOLb7+
I thought was never real
        SIb           REbadd9           SOLb7+               
I wanna let go of the pain I've felt so long
               MIb5
(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
        SIb           REbadd9
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like 
    SOLb7+             MIb5
I'm close to something real
        SIb                 REbadd9     LAb
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
MIb5          SIbm7
Somewhere I belong

             SOLb7+
And I've got nothing to say
          LA6
I can't believe I didn't fall 
      MIbm9
right down on my face
          SIbm7
(I was confused)
                   SOLb7+
Looking everywhere only to find
        LAb6             
That it's not the way 
                  MIbm9           SIbm7      
I had imagined it all in my mind
                     SOLb7+
What do I have but negativity
               LAb6
'Cause I can't justify the way, 
            MIbm9
everyone is looking at me
            SIbm7
(Nothing to lose)
                   SOLb7+
Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
         LAb6
And the fault is my own, 
        MIb5
and the fault is my own

        SIb           REbadd9
I wanna heal, I wanna feel what 
  SOLb7+
I thought was never real
        SIb           REbadd9           SOLb7+               
I wanna let go of the pain I've felt so long
               MIb5
(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
        SIb           REbadd9
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like 
    SOLb7+             MIb5
I'm close to something real
        SIb                 REbadd9     LAb
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
MIb5          SIb5
Somewhere I belong

       SOLb         LAb
I will never know myself until 
  MIb5          SIb5
I do this on my own
           SOLb       LAb
And I will never feel anything else, 
  MIb5              SIbm
until my wounds are healed
       SOLb     LAb             MIb5            SIb5
I will never be anything 'til I break away from me
       SOLb             LAb    MIb5   SIbm7
I will break away, I'll find myself today

(I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm)
MIb5          SIb
Somewhere I belong

(I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm)
MIb5          SIb5
Somewhere I belong

Somewhere I belong
