
Intro (ottava alta):
FA#5    SI5    MI5 LA5

      FA#5
Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time

Hand grenade pins in every line
SI5 
Throw 'em up and let something shine
MI5             LA5
Going out of my fucking mind
FA#5
Filthy mouth, no excuse

Find a new place to hang this noose
SI5
String me up from atop these roofs
MI5                LA5
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
RE7+
Truth is you can stop and stare
MI
Bled myself out and no one cares
FA#5
Dug a trench out, laid down there

With a shovel up out of reach somewhere
RE7+
Yeah, someone pour it in
MI       
Make it a dirt dance floor again
SI5                            
Say your prayers and stomp it out
          MI5               LA/DO#
When they bring that chorus in

           FA#5
I bleed it out
                       LA6
Digging deeper just to throw it away
           SI5
I bleed it out
                       MI5       LA/DO#
Digging deeper just to throw it away

Digging deeper just to throw it away
        SI5
Just to throw it away
        MI5       LA/DO#
Just to throw it away
           FA#5
I bleed it out
  

Go, stop the show

Choppy words in a sloppy flow
SI5
Shotgun opera, lock and load
MI5                   LA5
Cock it back and then watch it go
FA#5
Mama, help me, I've been cursed

Death is rolling in every verse
SI5
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
MI5
Can't contain him
   LA5
He knows he works
RE7+ 
Fuck this hurts, I won't lie
MI
Doesn't matter how hard I try
FA#5
Half the words don't mean a thing

And I know that I won't be satisfied
    RE7+
So, why try ignoring him?
MI
Make it a dirt dance floor again
SI5         
Say your prayers and stomp it out
          MI5               LA/DO#

                     MI
I've opened up these scars
                      RE7+
I'll make you face this
                      MI
I've pulled myself so far
              RE7+  MI   FA#5    SI5  MI5 LA/DO#
