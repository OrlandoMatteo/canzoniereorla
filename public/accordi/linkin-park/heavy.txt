I don't like my mind right now
            LA            DO#m     RE     
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
                  FA#m LA     MI
Wish that I could slow things down
            LA            DO#m         RE
I wanna let go, but there's comfort in the panic
      FA#m  LA MI
And I drive my-self crazy
         LA          DO#m    RE
Thinking everything's about me
        FA#m  LA MI
Yeah, I drive my-self crazy
         LA           DO#m     RE
'Cause I can't escape the gravity

Why is everything so heavy?
        FA#m LA MI
Holding o-------n
   LA           DO#m     RE
To so much more than I can carry
       FA#m      LA    MI
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
     LA       DO#m RE
If I just let go,  I'd be set free
        FA#m LA MI

You say that I'm para---noid
               LA       DO#m     RE7+
But I'm pretty sure the world is out to get me
           FA#m          LA    MI
It's not like I make the choice
   LA          DO#m   RE7+
To let my mind stay so fucking messy
  FA#m         LA         MI
I know I'm not the center of the universe
    LA               DO#m            RE7+
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
