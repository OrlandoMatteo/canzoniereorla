LAm   DO   FA7+   REm

                LAm
I dreamed I was missing
            DO        
You were so scared
                 FA7+
But no one would listen
                  REm
Cause no one else cared
         LAm
After my dreaming
                 DO
I woke with this fear
          FA7+  
What am I leaving
              REm
When I'm done here?
              FAadd9                   REm7/4
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know

        LAm7
When my time comes
                      DO
Forget the wrong that I've done
                FAadd9                  RE4
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
            LAm7
And don't resent me
                        DO  
And when you're feeling empty
                FAadd9
Keep me in your memory
                  RE4
Leave out all the rest
 
                  LAm
Leave out all the rest
          DO
Don't be afraid
              FA7+
I've taken my beating
                      REm
I've shared what I've made
                  LAm
I'm strong on the surface
                DO
Not all the way through
                FA7+
I've never been perfect
                 REm
But neither have you
              FAadd9                    REm7/4
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know

Keep me in your memory
                  RE4
Leave out all the rest
                  FAadd9
Leave out all the rest

Forgetting
        REm7/4                                LAm7  
All the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well

Pretending
        DO                               FAadd9            
Someone else can come and save me from myself
                   REm7/4
I can't be who you are

Someone else can come and save me from myself
                   DO    FA
I can't be who you are

I can't be who you are
