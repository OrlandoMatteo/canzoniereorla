   SIm   FA#m
No sleep
                   SIm                   FA#m
No sleep until I´m done with finding the answer
      SIm  FA#m
Won't stop
                    SIm                  FA#m
won't stop before I find a cure for this cancer

Sometimes
                 SIm               FA#m
I feel like I am down so and disconnected
RE      FA#m
Somehow
                 SIm           FA#m
I know that I am haunted to be wanted

             RE                  FA#m
I´ve been watching, I´ve been waiting
       SIm              FA#m
in the shadows.. For my time
              RE                FA#m

They say
#m                   SIm               FA#m
that I must learn to kill before I can feel save
    SIm   FA#m
But I
                SIm                 FA#m
I rather kill myself than turn into their slave
RE       FA#m
Sometimes
                     SIm                  FA#m
I feel that I should go and play with the thunder
RE      FA#m
Somehow
                   SIm                 FA#m
I just don't wanna stay and wait for a wonder
