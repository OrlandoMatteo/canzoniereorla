LAm                                     
Once upon a time, we had a lot to fight for
MIm
 We had a dream, we had a plan
LAm                        
Sparks in the air, we spread a lot of envy
MIm
Didn't have to care, once upon a time
  LAm
Remember when I swore

That love was never ending
    MIm
That you and I would never die
  LAm
Remember when I swore
          MIm
We had it all
          RE
We had it all

MIm    RE  DOadd9        SOL/SI  DOadd9
 Sail away, it's time to leave
      SOL/SI  LAm7          RE
Rainy days     are yours to keep
MIm    RE  DOadd9        SOL/SI       DOadd9
 Fade away, the night is calling my name
         SOL/SI  LAm7         RE
You will stay,     I'll sail away

LAm
Once upon a time, we used to burn candles
MIm
 We had a place to call a home
    LAm                        
The dream that we lived was better than divine
      MIm
Every day was like a gift, once upon a time
  LAm
Remember when you swore

Your love was never ending
MIm
 That you and I will never die
  LAm
Remember when you swore
          MIm
We had it all
           RE
We'd never fall

MIm    RE  DOadd9        SOL/SI  DOadd9
 Sail away, it's time to leave
      SOL/SI  LAm7          RE
Rainy days     are yours to keep
MIm    RE  DOadd9        SOL/SI       DOadd9
 Fade away, the night is calling my name
         SOL/SI  LAm7         RE  MIm
You will stay,     I'll sail awa---y

             LAm7
No reason to lie
   SOL        FA#
No need to pretend
                SI
I'm grateful to die
              DO
To live once again
                LAm7
I'm fearless to fly
    SOL           FA#
And reach for the end
                  SI7
And reach for the end
