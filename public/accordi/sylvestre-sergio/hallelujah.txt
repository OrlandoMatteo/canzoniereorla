
Intro:
       SIb  SOLm  SIb  SOLm

      SIb               SOLm
And I heard there was a secret chord
    SIb               SOLm
That David played and pleased the Lord
    MIb              FA            SIb      FA
But you don't really care for music, do you?
       SIb                 MIb         FA
But it goes like this: the fourth, the fifth
   SOLm                MIb
The minor fall and the major lift
    FA              RE7/FA#     SOLm        
The baffled king composing Hallelujah 

     MIb        SOLm7
Hallelujah Hallelujah
     MIb        SIb FA SIb  SOLm  SIb  SOLm
Hallelujah Hallelu-----jah

     SIb                      SOLm
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
    SIb             SOLm
You saw her bathing on the roof
    MIb            FA            SIb       FA
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
    SIb             MIb      FA
She tied you to her kitchen chair
   SOLm7                      MIb
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
    FA                RE7/FA#       SOLm7
And from the lips she drew the Hallelujah

     MIb        SOLm7
Hallelujah Hallelujah
     MIb        SIb FA SIb  SOL7
Hallelujah Hallelu-----jah


      DO              LAm
And I did my best, it wasn't much
  DO                  LAm
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
    FA        SOL              DO       SOL
I've told the truth, I couldn't fool you
    DO             FA        SOL
And even though it all went wrong
     LAm              FA
I'll stand before the Lord of Songs
     SOL           MI7/SOL#        LAm   LAm7
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

     FA         LAm7
Hallelujah Hallelujah
     FA         DO  SOL
Hallelujah Hallelu--u
     FA         LAm7  FA
Hallelujah Hallelujah
     DO  SOL  FA  LAm7
Hallelu--u----jah
     FA         DO  SOL  DO
Hallelujah Hallelu-------jah
