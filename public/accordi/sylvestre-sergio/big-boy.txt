I'm a big boy
                REb
But my heart is breaking
  LAb                                      SOLb
I thought that love would keep it safe from failing
SIbm
I'm a big boy
        LAb/DO    REb
And I'm on the ceiling
    LAb                            SOLb
But no one can keep tears away from falling
     LAb
What happens now
                       SOLb
That I'm driving on my own
     LAb
What happens now
                   SOLb
It's a long way back home

SIbm
 Just because I say alright
        SOLb
Doesn't mean alright
                     REb
It means nothing at all

Just because i'm doing fine
        LAb
Make it through life
                  SIbm
Is not enough at all

There is nothing going right
            SOLb
Without you tonight
                             REb
I've never been so far from home
                      LAb
I'm not a big boy anymore
                      SIbm
