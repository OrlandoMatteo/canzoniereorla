If you wanna be my friend
               RE#m   MI7+
You want us to get along
FA#                      SI7+
Please do not expect me to
               RE#m     MI7+
Wrap it up and keep it there
      FA#                   SI7+
The observation I am doing could
          RE#m   MI7+
Easily be understood
   FA#           SI7+
As cynical demeanor
              RE#m7 MI7+  FA#6
But one of us misread
                SI7+
And what do you know?

 A   friend is not a means
               RE#m     MI7+
You utilize to get somewhere
FA#                 SI7+
Somehow I didn't notice
           RE#m  MI7+  FA#
Friendship is an end

How come no one told me
               RE#m  MI7+
All throughout history
    FA#           SI7+
The loneliest people
                         RE#m       MI7+
Were the ones who always spoke the truth
    FA#                   SI7+
The ones who made a difference
                      RE#m  MI7+
By withstanding the indifference
  FA#                  SI7+
I guess it's up to me now
                   RE#m         MI7+  FA#
Should I take that risk or just smile?
