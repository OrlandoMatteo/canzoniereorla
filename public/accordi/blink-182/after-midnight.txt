LA
 I can't get my feet up off the edge
                        RE    
I kinda like the little rush you get
           
When you're standing close to death
                                 LA
Like when you're driving me crazy
   
Hold on as we crash into the earth
                           RE
A bit of pain will help us suffer when you're hurt
                                       
For real 'cause you were driving me crazy
FA#m7               
 Bite your lips, your word's a robbery
REadd9
 Do you grin inside, you're killing me
LA
 All along we talked of forever
      
I kinda think that we won't get better
         FA#m7
It's the longest start, 
                               REadd9
but the end is not too far away
                              LA
Did you know, I'm here to stay


We'll stagger home after midnight
                                 RE
Sleep arm-in-arm in the stairwell

We'll fall apart on the weekend
                              LA
These nights go on and on and on

LA
 I can't keep your voice out of my head
                        RE
All I hear are the many echoes of

The darkest words you said
                         LA
And it's driving me crazy
                      
I can't find the best in all of this
                       RE
But I'm always looking out for you

'Cause you're the one I miss
                         FA#m7
And it's driving me crazy
         
Bite your lips, your word's a robbery
REadd9
 Do you grin inside, you're killing me
