 It's hard to wake up
                                 LA4
When the shades have been pulled shut
   
This house is haunted
     LA                                 RE                   
It's so pathetic, it makes no sense at all
                         SIm7
I'm ripe with things to say
                         LA4
The words rot and fall away
                        LA
What stupid poem, could fix this home?
                   SOL
I'd read it every day

                    RE/FA#
So here's your holiday
           SOL
Hope you enjoy it this time
                 RE/FA#
You gave it all away
        SOL
It was mine
                         RE/FA#
So when you're dead and gone
           SOL
Will you remember this night?
                  RE/FA#
Twenty years now lost
            RE  RE/DO#  SIm  LA
It's not right

 Their anger hurts my ears
                               LA4
Been running strong for seven years
           
Rather than fix the problems
     LA                                      RE
They never solve them, it makes no sense at all
                 SIm7
I see them everyday
                           LA4
We get along so why can't they?

If this is what he wants
         LA
And it's what she wants
                            SOL
Then why is there so much pain?
