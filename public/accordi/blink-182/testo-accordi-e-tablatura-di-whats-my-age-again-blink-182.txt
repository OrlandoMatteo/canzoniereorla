I took her out
DO#4       RE#m7
  it was a Friday night
SIadd9     FA#
  I wore cologne
DO#4         RE#m7
  to get the feeling right
SIadd9       FA#
  We started making out
DO#4           RE#m7
  and she took off my pants
SIadd9       FA#           DO#4
  But then I turned on the TV

    SIadd9
And that's about the
                 FA#      DO#4
time she walked away from me
RE#m7    SIadd9
  Nobody likes you
            FA#    DO#4
when you're twenty-three
RE#m7           SIadd9
  And are still more
          FA# DO#4
amused by TV  shows
RE#m7            SIadd9
What the hell is ADD?
   FA#
My friends say I
       DO#4
should act my age
RE#m7
  What's my age again?
DO#4                   SIadd9
  What's my age again?

Then later on
DO#4     RE#m7
  on the drive home
SIadd9         FA#
  I called her mom
DO#4     RE#m7
  from a pay phone
SIadd9     FA#
  I said I was the cops
DO#4          RE#m7
  And your husband's in jail
SIadd9
  This state looks
FA#         DO#4
down on sodomy

    SIadd9
And that's about the
                 FA#      DO#4
time she walked away from me
RE#m7    SIadd9
  Nobody likes you
            FA#    DO#4

RE#m7           SIadd9
  And are still more
          FA#         DO#4
amused by prank phone calls
RE#m7            SIadd9
What the hell is call ID?
   FA#
My friends say I
       DO#4
should act my age
RE#m7
  What's my age again?
DO#4                   SIadd9
  What's my age again?

  Nobody likes you
            FA#    DO#4
when you're twenty-three
RE#m7           SIadd9
  And you still act like
          FA#      DO#4
you're in Freshman year
RE#m7            SIadd9
What the hell is wrong with me?
   FA#
My friends say I
       DO#4
should act my age
RE#m7
  What's my age again?
    SIadd9
And that's about the
               FA#     DO#4
time she broke up with me
RE#m7           SIadd9
  No one should take
              FA#    DO#4
themselves so seriously
RE#m7       SIadd9
  With many years ahead
   FA#     DO#4
to fall in line
RE#m7              SIadd9
Why would you wish that on me?
  FA#           DO#4
I never want to act my age
RE#m7
  What's my age again?
DO#4
  What's my age again?
