SOL               DO6
 So at my show on Monday
             LAm7
I was hoping someday
                 SIm    DO     SOL
You'd be on your way to better things
                    DO6
It's not about your make-up
                  LAm7
Or how you try to shape up
         SIm      DO    SOL  DO6
To these tiresome paper dreams
      LAm          SIm DO SOL
Paper dreams honey
                DO6
So now you pour your heart out
                         LAm7
You're telling me you're far out
             SIm      DO       SOL
Not about to lie down for your cause
              DO
But you don't pull my strings
             LAm7
'Cause I'm a better man
SIm          DO      SOL
Moving on to better things

         RE             LAm7
Well, uh-oh, oh, I love her because
    DO       RE      MIm
She moves in her own way
         DO               LAm7
Well, uh-oh, oh, she came to my show
        DO    RE      SOL
Just to hear about my day

SOL                 DO6
 And at the show on Tuesday
               LAm7
She was in her mindset
         SIm      DO       SOL
Tempered furs and spangled boots
               DO6
Looks are deceiving
          LAm7
Make me believe it
          SIm      DO    SOL    DO6
And these tiresome paper dreams
      LAm7         SIm DO SOL
Paper dreams honey,  yeah
             DO6
So won't you go far
                 LAm7

             SIm      DO       SOL
Not about to lie down for your cause
              DO   
But you don't pull my strings because
             LAm7
'Cause I'm a better man

MIm     RE           SIm   DO
 Yes, I wish that we never made it
SOL                    MIm
Through all the summers
              RE
And kept them up instead of
        SIm DO   SOL               MIm
Kicking us  back down to the suburbs
       RE                 SIm  DO
