 He said I'm  worth it,  his one desire
                        LAb                     FAm SOL
I know things about him that you wouldn't wanna read about
     LAb     FAm SOL        LAb FAm SOL      LAb   FAm SOL
He kissed me, his one and only (yes), beautiful liar
                   LAb   
Tell me how you tolerate the things 
              FAm        SOL
that you just found out about
          LAb   FAm SOL
You never know
               LAb      FAm SOL
Why are we the ones who suffer
          LAb   FAm SOL
I have to let go
             LAb       FAm SOL
He won't be the one to cry

SOL        LAb      FAm SOL
 Let's not kill the karma
          LAb    FAm SOL
Let's not start a fight
         LAb       FAm   SOL
It's not worth the drama
      LAb   FAm SOL
For a beautiful liar
         LAb    FAm    SOL
Can't we laugh about it
         LAb     FAm SOL
It's not worth our time
          LAb   FAm SOL
We can live without him
       LAb   FAm SOL
Just a beautiful liar

                          SOL      LAb FAm   
I trusted him, but when I followed you, 
  SOL       LAb  FAm SOL
I saw you toge---ther
                        LAb   
I didn't know about you then 'til 
               FAm    SOL
I saw you with him again
         LAb   FAm  SOL  LAb FAm SOL   LAb   FAm SOL
I walked in on your love scene,   slow dancing
             LAb   
You stole everything, 
                  FAm     SOL
how can you say I did you wrong
            LAb   FAm SOL
We'll never know
                  LAb          FAm SOL
When the pain and heartbreak's over
              LAb   FAm SOL
I have to let go
      
The innocence is gone

SOL        LAb      FAm SOL
 Let's not kill the karma
          LAb    FAm SOL
Let's not start a fight
         LAb       FAm   SOL
It's not worth the drama
      LAb   FAm SOL
For a beautiful liar
         LAb    FAm    SOL
Can't we laugh about it
         LAb     FAm SOL
It's not worth our time
          LAb   FAm SOL
We can live without him
       LAb         FAm 
Just a beautiful liar

                  DOm
Tell me how to forgive you
                    FAm
When it's me who's ashamed
                   DOm
And I wish I could free you
                    FAm
Of the hurt and the pain
                  DOm
But the answer is simple
                SOL   LAb  FAm SOL   
He's the one to blame
