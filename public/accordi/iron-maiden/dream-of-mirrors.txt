 Have you ever felt the future is the past
                        FA5  MI5
But you don't know how?
LA5
 A reflected dream of a captured time
                  FA5               MI5
Is it really now? Is it really happening?

 Don't know why  I feel this way

 Have I dreamt this time, this place?
LAm        SOL/LA LAm    SOL/LA 
 Something vivid  comes again 
  LAm   SOL/LA  LAm   SOL/LA
into my mind
LAm    SOL/LA     LAm       SOL/LA
 And I think I've seen your face

 Seen this room, been in this place

into my mind

 All my hopes and expectations

 Looking for an explanation

might lose my mind

 Am I still inside my dream?

 Is this a new   reali--ty?

 Coming to the realization
FA5                   SOL5
 That I can't see for sure

LA5              FA5       SOL5
 I only dream in black and white

 Dreading the   oncoming night

 Scared to fall   asleep and dream

the dream again
LAm      SOL/LA LAm   SOL/LA
 Nothing that I contemplate
LAm      SOL/LA  LAm    SOL/LA
 Nothing that  I can compare
LAm         SOL/LA    LAm    SOL/LA
 To letting loose the demons deep

inside my head
FA5                  RE5
 Dread to think what might be stirring
FA5               RE5
 That my dream is reoccurring

 Got to keep away from drifting
