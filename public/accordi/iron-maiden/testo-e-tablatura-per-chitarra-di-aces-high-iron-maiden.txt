
SIm
  On a dark desert highway
FA#
  cool wind in my hair
LA
  Warm smell of colitas
MI
  rising up through the air
SOL
  Up ahead in the distance
RE
  I saw a shimmering light
MIm
  My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
FA#
  I had to stop for the night

SIm
  There she stood in the doorway
FA#
  I heard the mission bell
LA
  And I was thinking to myself
              MI
this could be heaven or this could be hell
SOL
  Then she lit up a candle
RE
  and she showed me the way
MIm
  There were voices down the corridor
FA#
  I thought I heard them say

SOL                      RE
Welcome to the Hotel California
       MIm
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
       SIm7
such a lovely face
SOL                             RE
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
    MIm
Any time of year (any time of year)
        FA#
you can find it here

SIm
  Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
FA#
  she got the Mercedes bends
LA
  She got a lot of pretty
MI
  pretty boys she calls friends
SOL
  How they dance in the courtyard
RE
  sweet summer sweat
MIm
  Some dance to remember
FA#
  some dance to forget

SIm
  So I called up the Captain
FA#
  'Please bring me my wine'
       LA
He said, 'We haven't had that spirit here
      MI
since nineteen sixty nine'
SOL
  And still those voices are calling
     RE
from far away,
MIm
  Wake you up in the middle of the night
FA#
  Just to hear them say...

SOL                      RE
Welcome to the Hotel California.
       MIm
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
       SIm7
such a lovely face
     SOL                           RE
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
       MIm
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
           FA#
Bring your alibis

SIm
  Mirrors on the ceiling
FA#
  The pink champagne on ice
            LA
And she said 'We are all just prisoners here
MI
  of our own device'
SOL
  And in the master's chambers
RE
  They gathered for the feast
MIm
  They stab it with their steely knives
         FA#
But they just can't kill the beast

SIm
  Last thing I remember
     FA#
I was running for the door
LA
  I had to find the passage
            MI
back to the place I was before
SOL
  'Relax,' said the night man
       RE
'We are programmed to receive.
MIm
  You can check-out any time you like,
FA#
  But you can never leave!'
