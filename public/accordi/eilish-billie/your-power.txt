Now, I'm craving your body, is this real
              LAb7+     LAbm7        MIb7+/9
Temperature's rising, I don't wanna feel
           LAb7+       LAbm7 MIb7+/9  LAb/MIb
I'm in the wrong place to be real
LAbm     MIb7+/9        LAb7+     LAbm7     SOLm7
Whoa and I'm longing to love you just for a night
            LAb7+       LAbm7       MIb7+/9
Kissing and hugging and holding you tight
              LAb7+    LAbm7    MIb7+/9
Please let me love you with all my might

Reasons, the reasons that we're here
    DOm7    DOm/SIb LAb7+
The reasons that we fear

Our feelings won't    disappear
SOL7/9+
Oh! 

MIb7+/9        LAb7+     LAbm7    MIb7+/9
And, after the love game has been played
         LAb7+              LAbm7 MIb7+/9
All our illusions were just a   parade
            LAb7+   LAbm7    MIb7+/9   LAbm7
And all our reasons start to fade

      LAb7+   SOLm7   FAm7
After all our reasons why
        LAb7+   SOLm7  FAm7
All our reasons were a lie
      LAb7+   SOLm7   FAm7           SIb11
After all our reasons love was left aside

MIb7+/9        LAb7+    LAbm7  MIb7+/9
I'm longing to love you for one night
       LAb7+       LAbm7    MIb7+/9     LAbm7
Please let me love you with all of my might,

Yeah, reasons, the reasons that we're here
    DOm7    DOm/SIb LAb7+
The reasons that we fear
    SOLm7    FAm7 FAm/MIb     REm7/4    SOL7/9+
Our feelings won't they won't disappear

And all the reasons start to fade
MIb7+/9    LAb7+   LAbm7 MIb7+/9
And in the morning when I rise
       LAb7+     LAbm7 MIb7+/9
No longer feeling hypnotized
       LAb7+   SOL7 DOm    DOm/SIb LAm7/5-
For no reasons, our reasons, our   reasons
        SOL7/4  SOL7
Have no pride

      LAb7+   SOLm7   FAm7
After all our reasons why
        LAb7+   SOLm7  FAm7
All our reasons were a lie
      LAb7+   SOLm7   FAm7          SIb11
After all our reasons love was left aside...
