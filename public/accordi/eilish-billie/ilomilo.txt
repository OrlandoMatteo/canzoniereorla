Told you not to worry
                   DOm
But maybe that's a lie
                      
Honey, what's your hurry?
                 SOLm
Won't you stay inside
                FAm
Remember not to get too close to stars
                    DOm
They're never gonna give you love like ours
     
Where did you go? I should know
                    SOLm
But it's cold and I don't
                                   FAm
Wanna be lonely so show me the way home
                DOm
I can't lose another life

Hur----ry, I'm worried
                     FAm
The world's a little blurry
                 DOm
Or maybe it's my eyes
                        
The friends I've had to bury
                   SOLm
They keep me up at night

                         FAm
Said I couldn't love someone
  
'Cause I might break
                DOm
If you're gonna die, not by mistake
  
So where did you go? I should know
                    SOLm
But it's cold and I don't
                                        FAm
Wanna be lonely so tell me you'll come home
                    DOm
Even if it's just a lie
                 
I tried not to upset you
                            SOLm
Let you rescue me the day I met you
                    FAm
I just wanted to protect you
                   DOm
But now I'll never get to

DOm
Where did you go? I should know
                          SOLm     
But it's cold and I don't wanna be lonely
                       FAm
Was hoping you'd come home
                 DOm   
I don't care if it's a lie
