SOLm     DOm  RE7

SOLm
White shirt now red, my bloody nose

Sleeping, you're on your tippy toes
DOm
Creeping around like no one knows
RE7
Think you're so criminal
SOLm
Bruises on both my knees for you

Don't say thank you or please, I do
DOm
what I want when I'm wanting to
RE7
My soul? So cynical
            SOLm
So you're a tough guy

Like-it-really-rough guy
                
Just-can't-get-enough guy

Chest-always-so-puffed guy
         DOm
I'm that bad type

Make-your-mama-sad type
                     RE7
Make-your-girlfriend-mad type

Might-seduce-your-dad type
            SOLm          
I'm the bad guy, duh
        DOm      RE7
I'm the bad guy

SOLm
I like it when you take control

Even if you know that you don't
DOm
Own me, I'll let you play the role
RE7
I'll be your animal
SOLm
My mommy likes to sing along

With me but she won't sing this song
DOm
If she reads all the lyrics
RE7       
She'll pity the men I know
            SOLm
So you're a tough guy

Like-it-really-rough guy

Just-can't-get-enough guy
 
Chest-always-so-puffed guy
         DOm
I'm that bad type

Make-your-mama-sad type
                     RE7
Make-your-girlfriend-mad type

Might-seduce-your-dad type
            SOLm      
I'm the bad guy, duh
        DOm      RE7            SOLm 
I'm the bad guy,   ...duh
                       DOm  
I'm only good at being bad
RE7       SOLm
Bad


I like when you get mad
                  
I guess I'm pretty glad
    
That you're alone

You said she's scared of me?

I mean

I don't see what she sees

But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
 
I'm a bad guy

I'm, I'm a bad guy

Bad guy, bad guy

I'm a bad guy
