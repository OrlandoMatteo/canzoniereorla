My Lucifer is lonely

SOL#m                   MI
Standing there, killing time

Can't commit to anything but a crime
DO#m                    RE#7
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
SOL#m         MI
 Animals, evidence

Pearly gates look more like a picket fence
DO#m
Once you get inside 'em
    RE#7
Got friends but can't invite them
SOL#m
 Hills burn in California
MI
 My turn to ignore ya
DO#m                       RE#7
 Don't say I didn't warn ya

SOL#m                     MI
All the good girls go to hell
                   DO#m     RE#7
'Cause even God herself has enemies
    SOL#m                    MI
And once the water starts to rise
                    DO#m
And Heaven's out of sight
                RE#7         SOL#m  MI
She'll want the Devil on her team

SOL#m                 MI
 Look at you needing me

You know I'm not your friend without some greenery
DO#m
Walk in wearing fetters
RE#7
Peter should know better
SOL#m                     MI
 Your cover up is caving in

Man is such a fool

Why are we saving him?
DO#m
Poisoning themselves now
RE#7 
Begging for our help, wow!
