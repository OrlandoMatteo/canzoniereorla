       RE7+ MI   DO#m RE

RE7+   MI 
     I had a dream
DO#m        RE7+    
 I got everything I wanted
    MI
Not what you'd think
DO#m            RE7+
 And if I'm being honest
                               MI
It might have been a nightmare
              DO#m        RE7+
To anyone who might care
        MI                  
Thought I could fly
DO#m          RE7+
 So I stepped off the golden
  MI           DO#m
Nobody cried
       RE7+
Nobody even noticed
                                 MI
I saw them standing right there
                   DO#m        RE7+
Kinda thought they might care

  MI           DO#m
I had a dream
           RE7+
I got everything I wanted
                MI
But when I wake up, I see
DO#m     RE7+
You with me
 
And you say
           MI       DO#m
As long as I'm here
       RE7+
No one can hurt you
          MI         DO#m
Don't wanna lie here
        RE7+
But you can learn to
     MI               DO#7         RE7+     
If I could change the way that you see yourself
                 MI
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
DO#m           RE7+
 "They don't deserve you"

           MI      DO#m
I tried to scream
                RE7+
But my head was under water
             MI     DO#m
They called me weak
                      RE7+
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
                         MI
Could've been a nightmare
                           DO#m        RE7+
But it felt like they were right there
                            MI
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
    DO#m                 RE7+
But I don't wanna let anybody know
                                 MI
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
    DO#m                  RE7+
And I don't wanna let 'em down

  MI           DO#m
I had a dream
           RE7+
I got everything I wanted
                MI
But when I wake up, I see
DO#m     RE7+
You with me
 
And you say
           MI       DO#m
As long as I'm here
       RE7+
No one can hurt you
          MI         DO#m
Don't wanna lie here
        RE7+
But you can learn to
     MI               DO#7         RE7+     
If I could change the way that you see yourself
                 MI
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
DO#m           RE7+
 "They don't deserve you"
              MI                      DO#m
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
               RE7+
Would I do it again?
                  MI                                DO#m        
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
                    RE7+
What would they say instead?
                 MI                   DO#7         
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
               RE7+
Would I do it again?
                     MI                             DO#m
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
                    RE7+      MI  DO#m  RE7+
What would they say instead?
