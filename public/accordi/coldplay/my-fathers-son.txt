LAb6   SOL7   DOm

           LAb6      SOL7
Heart over mind, yes I'm
     DOm7
My father's son
          LAb6       SOL7
I live my life, just like
     DOm7
My father's done
           FAm          SOL7
If he'd've told me, one day
         DOm7
That somebody'd have my heart in chains
          FAm          SOL7
Would I believe it? No way
           DOm
Made up my mind I'd never fall that way
            LAb
But tell me why
             SOLm                     FAm
Every time I try to tell you it's goodbye
                MIb9
I can't seem to let go
      LAb                    SOLm
In my heart I know I want to stay
                   DO
What I'm trying to say

           FAm
Heart over mind
    SOL7     DOm7
Yes I'm my father's son
          LAb6      SOL7
And I'm inclined to do
        DOm
As my father's done

FAm7   SOL7   DOm       FAm   SOL7   DOm


               SIbm7   MIb9
Here I am with you
      MIb7           LAb7+  REb7+
And I know that it's true
                SIbm     MIb9
Despite all the feelings
 MIb7             LAb7+    REb7+
You're putting me through
               DO7/4 DO7
I try to walk away, 
                   SOLb7+ SOL7
something makes me stay
