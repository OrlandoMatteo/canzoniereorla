Well I tried to make it Sunday, 
      SOL#m
but I got so damn depressed
       LA               MI
That I set my sights on Monday 
      SOL#m      
and I got myself undressed
        LA            FA#m
I ain't ready for the altar 
      DO#m SOL#m7      LA
but I do agree there's times
       FA#m7/4        LA               MI
When a woman sure can be a friend of mine

        MI
Well, I keep on thinkin' 'bout you, 
       SOL#m

      LA                MI
And I just can't live without you 
          SOL#m

Will you meet me in the middle, 
         LA             MI
will you meet me in the air?
         SI
Will you love me just a little, 
       LA                MI
just enough to show you care?
       FA#m7
Well I tried to fake it, 
  SOL#m7               LA
I don't mind sayin', I just can't make it
