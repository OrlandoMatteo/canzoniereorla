SOL7+                          DO7+
Sometimes late when things are real
                     SOL7+                  DO7+
And people share the gift of gab between themselves
SOL7+                      DO7+
Some are quick to take the bait
                      SOL7+                      DO7+
And catch the perfect prize that waits among the shelves
    LAm7/9                           SOL7+   
But Oz never did give nothing to the Tin Man
        LAm7/9                 SOL7+
That he didn't, didn't already have
    LAm7/9                             SOL7+
And Cause never was the reason for the evening
       LAm7/9            SOL7+
Or the tropic of Sir Galahad
   DO/RE             RE
So please believe in me

       SOL7+ 
When I say I'm spinning round, round, round, round
DO7+
Smoke glass stain bright color
SOL7+        
Image going down, down, down, down
DO7+                          
Soapsuds green like bubbles...

SOL7+  DO7+  SOL7+  DO7+

    LAm7/9                           SOL7+
Oh, Oz never did give nothing to the Tin Man
        LAm7/9                 SOL7+
That he didn't, didn't already have
    LAm7/9                             SOL7+
And Cause never was the reason for the evening
       LAm7/9            SOL7+
Or the tropic of Sir Galahad
   DO/RE             RE
So please believe in me

No, Oz never did give nothing to the Tin Man
        LAm7/9                 SOL7+
That he didn't, didn't already have
