 Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face
MIm              DO6           
 You told me how proud you were, but I walked away
LAm           SI7        
 If only I knew what I know today
MIm
 Ooooooo

        DO
I would hold you in my arms
        LA7/DO#
I would take the pain away
RE
Thank you for all you've done
   SI/RE#
Forgive all your mistakes
        DO
There's nothing I wouldn't do
   LA7/DO#
to hear your voice again
    RE
Sometimes I wanna call you
      SI/RE#
But I know you won't be there
MIm             SI/RE#        MIm
Woah, I'm sorry for, blaming you
         DO
For everything, I couldn't do
LAm            SI7               MIm
  and I hurt myself, by hurting you

                   SI/RE#
Some days I feel broke inside but I won't admit
MIm                 DO6               
  Sometimes I just wanna hide cause it's you I miss
LAm7                          SI                    
  And it's so hard to say goodbye

when it comes to this
MIm
  Oooooo

          DO
Would you tell me I was wrong
          LA7/DO#
Would you help me understand
        RE
Are you looking down upon me
        SI7/RE#
Are you proud of who I am
        DO
There's nothing I wouldn't do
   LA7/DO#
To have just one more chance
   RE
To look into your eyes
    SI7/RE#
And see you looking back
MIm             SI/RE#        MIm
Woah, I'm sorry for, blaming you
         DO  
For everything, I just couldn't do
LAm7            SI7             
   And I hurt myself, 

MIm    RE                DO7+           
  If I had just one more day, 
        MIm 
I would tell you how much that I've
RE                            DO7+
missed you since you've been away
LAm           MI/SOL#
Ohh it's dangerous
               LAm/SOL
It's so out of line 
FA#m7/5-               SI
   to try to turn back time

MIm         SI/RE#       MIm
  I'm sorry for blaming you
         DO6
For everything I just couldn't do
LAm7             SI   
  And I've hurt myself

DO   LAm7   SI
   
           MIm
By hurting you
