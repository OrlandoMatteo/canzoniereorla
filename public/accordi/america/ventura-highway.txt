SOL6                                            RE7+
 Chewin' on a piece of grass, walkin' down the road
SOL6                        RE7+ 
 Tell me, how long you gonna stay here, Joe?
SOL6                               RE7+
 Some people say this town don't look good in snow
SOL6               RE7+
 You don't care, I know

SOL6                  RE7+
 Ventura Highway in the sunshine
           SOL6
Where the days are longer
                            RE7+
The nights are stronger than moonshine
SOL6                RE7+   FA#m7/4
 You're gonna go, I know...

           MIm7                 FA#m7
'Cause the free wind is blowin' through your hair
        MIm7               FA#m7
And the days surround your daylight there
MIm7            FA#m7
 Seasons crying no despair
    MIm7          FA#m7              SOL6
Alligator lizards in the air, in the air

RE7+   SOL7+   RE7+   SOL7+
Du du...

                  
Wishin' on a falling star, 
               RE7+
waitin' for the early train
SOL6                                RE7+
 Sorry boy, but I've been hit by a purple rain
SOL6                        RE7+
 Aw, c'mon Joe, you can always change your name
SOL6                        RE7+
 Thanks a lot son, just the same
