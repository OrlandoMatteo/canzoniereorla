SOLm7     FA/LA                 SIb
 Whatever happened to the funky race?
             DO           SOLm7
A generation lost in pace
               FA/LA
Wasn't life supposed to be more than this?
SIb                DO
 In this kiss I'll change your bore for my bliss
SOLm7                      
 Let go off my hand and it will
FA/LA
 Slip on the sand if you don't
SIb
Give me the chance
         DO
To break down the walls of attitude
SOLm7   FA/LA
  I ask nothing of you
SIb             DO
 Not even your gratitude
    SIb
And if you think I'm corny
        DO
Then it will not make me sorry
          REm7                FA
It's your right to laugh at me
              SIb                DO
And in turn, that's my opportunity
           REm   FA
To feel brave

                  SIb               DO
'Cause it takes a fool to remain sane
               REm7              FA
Oh, it takes a fool to remain sane
               SIb               DO
Oh, it takes a fool to remain sane
            REm7                      FA
Oh, in this world all covered up in shame

SOLm7                 
Every morning I would see 
    FA/LA
her getting off the bus
    SIb
The picture never drops, 
            DO
it's like a multicolored snapshot
SOLm7                 FA/LA
Stuck in my brain, it kept me sane
      SIb                    DO
For a couple of years, as it drenched my fears
     SOLm7
Of becoming like the others
      FA/LA
Who become unhappy mothers
    SIb                 DO
And fathers of unhappy kids
               
And why is that?
                  SIb               DO
'Cause they've forgotten how to play
                  REm7                 FA
Or maybe they're afraid to feel ashamed
           SIb
To seem strange
            DO
To seem insane
                        REm7
To gain weight, to seem gay
                 FA
I'll tell you this:

                  SIb               DO
'Cause it takes a fool to remain sane
               REm7              FA
Oh, it takes a fool to remain sane
               SIb               DO
Oh, it takes a fool to remain sane
            REm7                      FA
Oh, in this world all covered up in shame
                        SIb  DO  SOL  FA
I'll take it to the stage!

SIb  DO  SOL  FA

    SOLm7
So, take it to the stage 
     FA/LA
in a multicolored jacket
        SIb
Take it jackpot, crackpot, 
DO
strutting like a peacock
SOLm7                  FA/LA
Nail varnish Arkansas, shimmy-shammy feather boa
SIb
Crackpot haircut, 
         DO                        SIb
dye your hair in glowing red and blue
          DO           
Do, do, do what you wanna do
REm7                    
Don't think twice, do what you have to do
SIb            DO
Do, do, do, do, let your heart decide
REm7
 What you have to do, 
FA                        SIb   DO
 that's all there is to find
                    
                  REm7              FA
'Cause it takes a fool to remain sane
               SIb               DO
Oh, it takes a fool to remain sane
            REm7                      FA
Oh, in this world all covered up in shame
                  SIb               DO
'Cause it takes a fool to remain sane
               REm7              FA
Oh, it takes a fool to remain sane
               SIb               DO
Oh, it takes a fool to remain sane
            REm7                      FA
Oh, in this world all covered up in shame
               SIb  DO  REm7  FA
Oh, it takes a fool!... 

            SIb              DO   REm7   FA
(It takes a fool to remain sane...)
