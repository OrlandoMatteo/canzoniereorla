Time keeps painting my darling
 
Ripped all the flowers in the garden
FA            DO
 Oh baby come home
FA                    DO
 you angels bring her home

DO
Imens står solen over højen
 
Han mindes den sommer hvor hun strålede
FA                 DO
 Forsvandt i haven gron
FA                    DO
 og træernes sang hun fandt

DO
Time keeps painting my darling
        FA                              DO
And the garden keeps on singing the old song
        LAm	   SOL	          FA
Oh baby still I am waiting in the light
 	   DO           SOL       DO
Hoping the angels would carry you home

    DO
Den sang tog mørket i sin pote
    FA                          DO
Den bar hans kvinde i dens kolde favn
 	 LAm       SOL              FA
Og lagde hende for hans dør i silkekjole
 	   DO	        SOL	  DO
Hoping the angels would carry you home

 	   FA	            SOL
Leaving it all with my only friend
 	       DO	       FA
Her beauty was lifeless on the stair
 	               SOL
Oh baby I´ll carry you away
 	 DO
into the garden´s tale
                     FA	                SOL
But everything (had) died and turned to stones
 	   DO	              FA
I laid her down under the old oak
 	     SOL
Seing it all
 	  DO
blossom forever more

LAm   FA  SOL    LAm   FA  SOL

DO
 Time keep on painting my darling
 	FA	                        DO
And the garden keeps on singing the old song
 	LAm	   SOL         FA
Oh baby now I know you´re in the light
 	    DO	          SOL	   DO
Painting it all with your colorful songs

 DO
Imens står solen over højen
     FA	                    DO
Hans skygge kastes ud i haven grøn
 	      LAm      SOL     FA
Forsvandt for evigt og uden en note
 	   DO	        SOL	  DO
Hoping the angels would carry you home

Leaving it all with my only friend
