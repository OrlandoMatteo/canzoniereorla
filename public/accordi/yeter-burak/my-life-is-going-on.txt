            LA             DO#m
Every breaking wave on the shore
          MI                        SI
Tells the next one "there'll be one more"
                LA              DO#m
And every gambler knows that to lose
   MI                       SI
Is what you're really there for
             LA          DO#m
Summer I was fearlessness
      MI                   SI
Now I speak into an answer phone
                LA            DO#m
Like every fallen leaf on the breeze
MI                        SI
Winter wouldn't leave it alone, alone

        LA  DO#m
If you go...
          MI                SI
If you go your way and I go mine
        LA  DO#m
Are we so...
          MI                   SI
Are we so helpless against the tide?
            LA            DO#m
Baby, every dog on the street
                    MI            SI
Knows that we're in love with defeat
                   LA              DO#m
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
          MI     SI             LA    DO#m
And stop chasing every breaking wave?

             LA             DO#m
Every sailor knows that the sea
     MI              SI
Is a friend made enemy
                   LA                    DO#m
And every shipwrecked soul knows what it is
   MI                 SI
To live without intimacy
                      LA             DO#m
I thought I heard the captain's voice
                 MI               SI
But it's hard to listen while you preach
                 LA           DO#m
Like every broken wave on the shore
MI                        SI
This is as far as I could reach

        LA  DO#m
If you go...
          MI                SI
If you go your way and I go mine

The sea knows where are the rocks
    LA
And drowning is no sin
MI 
You know where my heart is
    SI
The same place that yours has been
FA#m7
We know that we fear to win
    LA                    MI
And so we end before we begin

Before we begin
