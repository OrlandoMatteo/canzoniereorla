 I let beast in too soon, 
             FA7+/5+
I don't know how to live without my 
MI7           FA7+/5+
Hands on his throat I fight him 
MI7       FA7+/5+
Always and still
MI7         FA7+/5+
 O darling, it's so sweet, 
    MI7                FA7+/5+
You think you know how crazy
    MI7     FA7+/5+  MI7 FA7+/5+
How crazy I am
MI7          FA7+/5+
 You say you don't spook easy,

 
SOL             SIm
You won't go, but I know
      MIm           MIm/RE#  MIm/RE  DO#m7/5-  
And I pray that you will

DO          DOm/MIb
Fast as you can, baby 
SOL/RE       DO#m7/5-
Run free yourself of me
DO7            
Fast as you can


MI7  FA7+/5+

MI7       FA7+/5+      MI7
 I may be soft in your palm 
                   FA7+/5+      MI7
But I'll soon grow hungry for a fight
      FA7+/5+
And I will not let you 
MI7   FA7+/5+
Win...
MI7          FA7+/5+
 My pretty mouth will frame the 
        MI7       FA7+/5+
Phrases that will disprove your
MI7       FA7+/5+    MI7+  FA7+/5+
Faith in man
MI7        FA7+/5+
 So if you catch me trying to


SOL              SIm       
Find my way into your heart from
MIm     MIm/RE#  MIm/RE#  DO#m7/5-   
Under your skin...

DO          DOm/MIb
Fast as you can, baby 
SOL/RE          DO#m7/5-
Scratch me out, free yourself
DO        DOm  SOL/RE  DO#m7/5-
Fast as you can
DO          DOm/MIb
Fast as you can, baby 
SOL/RE          DO#m7/5-
Scratch me out, free yourself
DO9       
Fast as you can

SOL    FA         DO7+
 Sometimes my mind don't shake and shift
SOL      FA          LAm7        SOL
 But most of the time, it does
                 FA            LAm7       MIm
And I get to the place where I'm begging for a lift
      SOL                  SOL/FA
Or I'll drown in the wonders and the was

SOL                  SOL/FA  DO7+
 And I'll be your girl, if you say it's a gift
SOL                   SOL/FA       LAm7
 And you give me some more of your drugs
      SOL            SOL/FA         LAm7            MIm
Yeah, I'll be your pet, if you just tell me it's a gift
           SOL            SOL/FA
'Cause I'm tired of whys, choking on whys,
MIm              MIb7+
Just need a little because, because,


MI7  FA7+/5+

MI7        FA7+/5+      MI7
 I let the beast in and then
       FA7+/5+ 
I even tried forgiving him, 
 MI7             FA7+/5+
But it's too soon, so I'll fight 
        MI7            FA7+/5+
Again, again, again, again, again
MI7        FA7+/5+ 
 And for a little 
MI7         FA7+/5+
While more I'll soar the 
       MI7            FA7+/5+
Uneven wind, complain and blame the 
MI7      FA7+/5+
Sterile land
MI7            FA7+/5+
 But if you're getting any 


SOL           SIm
Bright ideas, quiet dear,
    MIm       MIm/RE#  MIm/RE  DO#m7/5-
I'm blooming within

DO          DOm/MIb
Fast as you can, baby 
SOL/RE         DO#m7/5-
Wait watch me, I'll be out
DO        DOm/MIb
Fast as I can, maybe 
SOL/RE      DO#m7/5-
Late but at least about
DO          DOm/MIb
Fast as you can, leave me 
SOL/RE         DO#m7/5-
Let this thing run its route
DO       DOm/MIb  SOL/RE  DO#m7/5- 
Fast as you    can
DO    DOm/MIb SOL/RE  DO#m7/5-
Fast as     you   can
DO   DOm/MIb SOL/RE DO#m7/5-
Fast as      you    can
DO  DOm/MIb SOL/RE DO#m7/5- DO DOm/MIb SOL/RE DO#m7/5-
    Fast    as       you    can
