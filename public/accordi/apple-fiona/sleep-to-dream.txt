 I tell you how I feel

But you don't care

I say tell me the truth

But you don't dare

You say love is a hell

You cannot bear

And I say gimme mine

Back and then go there

For all I care


DO
 I got my feet
       SIb7
On the ground
            LA7
And I don't go to

Sleep to dream
DO              SIb7
 You got your head

In the clouds
            LA7
And you're not at

All what you seem
DO              
 This mind, this body
         SIb7
And this voice cannot be
                  LA7         DO
Stifled by your deviant ways
                       SIb7
So don't forget what I told you

Don't come around
        LA7                SOLm
I got my own hell to raise


SOLm
I have never been

So insulted in all my life

I could swallow the seas

To wash down all this pride

First you run like a fool

Just to be at my side

And now you run like a fool

But you just run to hide

And I can't abide


DO
 I got my feet
       SIb7
On the ground
            LA7
And I don't go to

Sleep to dream
DO              SIb7
 You got your head

In the clouds
            LA7

DO7              LAb
 Don't make it a big deal
          RE7
Don't be so sensitive

We're not playing
  SIb7
A game anymore

You don't have
       LAb7          SOLm
To be so defensive


          SOLm
Don't you plead me your case

Don't bother to explain

Don't even show me your face

'Cause it's a crying shame

Just go back to the rock

From under which you came

Take the sorrow you gave

And all the stakes you claim

And don't forget the blame


DO
 I got my feet
       SIb7
On the ground

And I don't go
   LA7
To sleep to dream
DO
 You got your head
       SIb7
In the clouds and
               LA7
You're not at all

What you seem
DO          
 This mind, this body
