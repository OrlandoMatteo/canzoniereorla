
      MI             DO        SOL           SIm7
I was staring at the sky, just looking for a star
   MI7         DO          SOL             SI7
To pray on, or wish on, or something like that
      MI              DO      SOL            SIm7
I was having a sweet fix of a daydream of a boy
      FA        MIm         LA7
Whose reality I knew, was a hopeless to be had
           MI         DO            SOL       SIm7
But then the dove of hope began its downward slope
        MI                    DO
And I believed for a moment that my chances
    SOL                SI7
Were approaching to be grabbed
          MI           DO          SOL    FA
But as it came down near, so did a weary tear
  MIm              LA7              DO9
I thought it was a bird, but it was just a paper bag

       SOL          DO7+       FA          SOL
Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh it kills
                    DO7+          FA         
'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up
         SOL               DO7+         FA        SOL
I got to fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold
     MIm7               LA7
Hunger hurts, but starving works, 
        FA7/6             SOL    SI7/9+
when it costs too much to love

MI           DO    SOL
 And I went crazy again today, 
 SIm7          MI
looking for a strand to climb
DO            SOL         SI7
Looking for a little hope
MI  DO           SOL
    Baby said he couldn't stay, 
SIm7             FA
wouldn't put his lips to mine,
      MIm7              LA7
And a fail to kiss is a fail to cope
         MI             DO           SOL
I said, 'Honey, I don't feel so good, 
              SIm7
don't feel justified
MI            DO          SOL         SO7     
Come on put a little love here in my void,' he said
      MI          DO                       SOL
'It's all in your head,' and I said, 'So's everything'
              FA       MIm7             LA7
But he didn't get it I thought he was a man
           DO9
But he was just a little boy
