DO  MI  DO  MI  FA  MI  LAm 

DO         MI
 The early cars
DO       MI
 Already are
FA       MI           LAm
 Drawing deep breaths past my door
DO            MI
 And last night's phrases
DO                MI
Sick with lack of basis
FA         MI       LAm
 Are still writhing on my floor
LA7                  
 And it doesn't seem fair
          REm/FA
That your wicked words 
       SOLm7   REm
should work in holding me down
LA7
 It doesn't seem right
   FA        DO
To take information
FA             DO
Given at close range
        FA          DO
For the gag and the bind
        FA         MI
And the ammunition round

DO       MI           DO         MI
 A conversation, once colored by esteem
       FA 
Became diologue
     MI           LAm
As a diagram of a play for blood
DO        MI        DO         MI
 Took a vacation my palate got clean
          FA          MI
Now I can taste your agenda
             LAm
While you're spitting your cud


LA7
 And it doesn't make sense
         REm/FA       SOLm7
I should fall for the kingcraft 
     REm
of a meritless crown
LA7
 It doesn't seem right
   FA        DO
To take information
FA             DO
Given at close range
        FA          DO
For the gag and the bind
        FA         MI
And the ammunition round

 DO           MI        DO      MI
"What is this posture I have to stare at?"
DO             MI
That's what he said
           LAm
When I was sitting up straight
DO           MI
 Changed the name 
       DO             MI
of the game 'cause he lost it
   FA          MI
He knew he was wrong
       LAm
But he knew it too late


LA7
 But I'm not being fair
         REm/FA   SOLm7          REm
'Cause I chose to listen to that filthy mouth
LA7
 But I'd like to choose right
FA           DO            FA           DO
Take all the things that I said that he stole
FA           DO              FA      DO
Put 'em in a sack, swing 'em over my shoulder
FA         DO          FA         DO
Turn on my heels, step out of his sight
       FA        DO       MI
Try to live in a lovelier light
