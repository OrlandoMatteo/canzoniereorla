DO  FA6  DO  FA6

DO
 Every single night
FA6
 I endure the flight
DO                        SOL7/5+
 Of little wings of white-flamed
                  DO
Butterflies in my brain

These ideas of mine
SOL
 Percolate the mind
MIb7
 Trickle down the spine
LAb7                           SOL7
Swarm the belly, swelling to a blaze
                 MIb
That's where the pain comes in
SOL7          LAb
Like a second skeleton
DO              FAm7/5-       
Trying to fit beneath the skin
DO              SOL
I can't fit the feelings in
LAm                                 RE5
Every single night's alight with my brain

DO
 What'd I say to her?
FA6
 Why'd I say to her?
DO
 What does she think of me?
SOL7/5+
 That I'm not what I ought to be
DO 
 That I'm what I try not to be
     SOL                MIb7
It's got to be somebody else's fault
  LAb7
I can't get caught
   SOL7
If what I am is what I am, 
         MIb
'cause I does what I does
     SOL7
Then brother, get back, 
          LAb               
'cause my breast's gonna bust open
    DO                       FAm7/5-
The rib is the shell and the heart is the yolk
  DO                     SOL
I just made a meal for us both to choke on
LAm                    MI            RE5
Every single night's a fight with my brain

FA  SOL           SIb  LA
I... just want to feel everything
FA  SOL           SIb  LA
I... just want to feel everything
FA  SOL           SIb  LA
I... just want to feel everything
   
   DO                  FA6
So I'm gonna try to be still now
DO                 SOL7/5+
Gonna renounce the mill a little while and
DO                 SOL 
If we had a double-king-sized bed
         MIbb7              LAb7
We could move in it and I'd soon forget
     SOL7            
That what I am is what I am 
         MIb
'cause I does what I does
    SOL7
And maybe I'd relax, 
       LAb
let my breast just bust open
   DO                       FAm7/5-              
My heart's made of parts of all that surround me
    DO                        SOL
And that's why the devil just can't get around me
LAm                    MI
Every single night's alright, 
LAm                    MI
every single night's a fight
    LAm                    MI            RE5
And every single fight's alright with my brain

FA  SOL           SIb  LA
I... just want to feel everything
FA  SOL           SIb  LA
I... just want to feel everything
FA  SOL           SIb  LA
I... just want to feel everything
FA  SOL           SIb  LA
I... just want to feel everything
