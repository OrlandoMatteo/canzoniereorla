LAm                  FA7
 I've been a bad, bad girl
LAm                        FA7
 I've been careless with a delicate man
LAm               FA7
 And it's a sad sad world
LAm                           FA7
 When a girl will break a boy just because she can
DO         SIb7            FA7
 Don't you tell me to deny it
          DO                  SIb          LAm   
I've done wrong and I want to suffer for my sins
DO              SIb             LAb7           SOL
 I've come to you 'cause I need guidance to be true
           FA7                      LAb
And I just don't know where I can begin


FA7               DOm7
 What I need is a good defense
           FA7                DOm7
'Cause I'm feeling like a criminal
      FA7          
And I need to be redeemed
       DOm7              SIb
To the one I've sinned against
             LAb   SOL7         FA7
Because he's all I ever knew of love


LAm                     FA7
 Heaven help me for the way I am
LAm                             FA7
Save me from these evil deeds before I get them done
LAm                         FA7
 I know tomorrow brings the consequence at hand
    LAm                             FA7
But I keep living this day like the next will never come
   DO                SIb7            FA7
Oh help me but don't tell me to deny it
            DO                SIb      
I've got to cleanse myself of all these lies 'till 
    LAm             
I'm good enough for him 
DO          SIb
 I've got a lot to lose 
        LAb                 SOL
and I'm bettin' high so I'm begging you
  FA7                                  LAb
Before it ends just tell me where to begin


FA7               DOm7
 What I need is a good defense
           FA7                DOm7
'Cause I'm feeling like a criminal
      FA7          
And I need to be redeemed
       DOm7              SIb
To the one I've sinned against
             LAb   SOL7         FA7
Because he's all I ever knew of love

MIb     SI 
 Let me know the way
LAb             SI
 Before there's hell to pay
MIb      SI              LAb7
 Give me room to lay the law and let me go
MIb          SI    
 I've got to make a play
LAb         SI
 To make my lover stay
MIb               SI            LAb7
 So what would an angel say the devil wants to know

FA7               DOm7
 What I need is a good defense
           FA7                DOm7
'Cause I'm feeling like a criminal
      FA7          
And I need to be redeemed
       DOm7              SIb
To the one I've sinned against
             LAb   SOL7         FA7     DOm7
Because he's all I ever knew of love
