City's breaking down on a camel's back
LAbm7                             MIbm
They just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack

So while you fill the streets, 
      SIbm7
it's appealing to see
     LAbm7
You won't get out the county, 
              MIbm
'cause you're bad and free
    MIb                      SIbm7
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
  LAbm7                    MIbm
A melancholy town where we never smile
    MIb                     SIbm7
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
    LAbm7         
My dreams, they got a kissing
         MIbm                 MIb
'Cause I don't get sleep, no

SIbm7
Linin' 'em up like ass cracks
LAbm7
Play these ponies at the track
MIbm
It's my chocolate attack
MIb            
Shit, I'm steppin' in the heart of this here (yeah)
SIbm7
Care Bear rappin' in harder this year (yeah)
LAbm7                       MIbm
Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

     SIbm7
With yo' sound, you in the blink

With yo' sound, you kill the Inc.
   MIb
So don't stop, get it, get it (Get it)
