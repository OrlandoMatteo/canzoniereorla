There's the moon asking to stay 
FAadd9                MIm
  Long enough for the clouds
           MIb
 to fly me away
           FAadd9
Oooh, it's my time coming
MIm      MIb              MIm
I'm not afraid, afraid to die

My fading voice  sings..
LA6  SIm    LA6  MIm
  of lo..........ve
        MIm  FA#m6    SOL6
But she cries  to the clicking
LA6  SIm   LA6      MIm
  of time....... of time

And she weeps on my arm 
FAadd9           MIm
  Walking to the bright lights
   MIb
in sorrow
   FAadd9
Oh drink a bit of wine
   MIm             MIb           MIm
we both might go tomorrow, oh my love

And the rain is fall...ing...
LA6       SIm    LA6             MIm
  and I believe....  my time has come
     MIm      FA#m6  SOL6
It reminds me of the pain.....
LA6         SIm    LA6        MIm
... I might leave.... leave behind
