This is our last goodbye

I hate to feel the love between us die
         SOL
But it's over
          RE7+
Just hear this and then I'll go

Must I dream and always see your face?

Why can't we overcome this wall?

Baby, maybe its just 
                   SOL                
because you didn't know you at all

Kiss me, please kiss me

But kiss me out of desire, 
DO6       SOL         SOLadd9/SI
babe, not consolation

Oh, you know it makes me so angry

'Cause I know that in time,

 Did you say, "No, this can't happen to me"
            SIm7     LA            SOL
Did you rush to the phone to call
            RE          SOLadd9/SI
Was there a voice unkind 
       LA              SOL
in the back of your mind
       MIm7 SIm  LAm7   SOL
Saying maybe you didn't

know him at all

Well, the bells out in the church tower chime
        DO/RE                    SOL/RE
Burning clues into this heart of mine
            DO/RE       RE
Thinking so hard on her soft eyes
        DO/RE           RE              DO/RE
And the memories, offer signs that it's over
RE    RE7+/FA#   DO6/9
Over...
