LA                    MIm7
Over the sea and far away
                      LA
She's waiting like an iceberg
            MIm7
Waiting to change
                 LA
But she's cold inside
                 SOL        RE  RE4
She wants to be like the water
LA                MIm7           LA
 All the muscles tighten in her face
            MIm7          LA
Buries her soul in one embrace
                    SOL
They're one and the same
                 RE
Just like water

                SIm7
The fire fades away
             SOL
Most of everyday
           SOL/FA#   MIm7
Is full of tired excuses
         LA          RE
But it's too hard to say
               SIm7
I wish it were simple
                   SOL
But we give up easily

You're close enough to see that
SIm  SIm/LA    SOL           LA       RE  RE4
You're the other side of the world to me

LA                  MIm7
On comes the panic light
                LA                     MIm7
Holding on with fingers and feelings alike
                  LA
But the time has come
   SOL          RE      
To move along

                SIm7
The fire fades away
             SOL
Most of everyday

Can you help me?
                RE  RE4  MIm7
Can you let me go
                  SIm
And can you still love me
               LA     LA/SOL FA#m7 LA/MI
When you can't see me any---more
