      It's unfortunate
                    DO    FAm
that when we feel a stone
       LAbadd9
We can roll ourselves over
               DO           FAm
'cause we're uncomfortable
   LAbadd9
Oh well..
                   DO   FAm
the devil makes us sin
        LAbadd9
But we like it when we're spinning
DO       FAm   LAbadd9
  in his grip

Love is like a sin
   DO    FAm
my love
        LAbadd9
For the ones that
            DO    FAm
feel it the most
        LAbadd9
Look at her with her eyes
       DO    FAm
like a flame
         LAbadd9
She will love you like a fly
           DO      FAm     LAbadd9
will never love you again

a sin, my love
