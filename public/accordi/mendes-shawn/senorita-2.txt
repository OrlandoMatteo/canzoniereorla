This girl I know, needs some shelter
                   
She don't believe anyone can help her
SI4
 She's doing so much harm
                   SI7+
Doing so much damage

But you don't want to get involved
                         SIm7/4
You tell her she can manage
 
And you can't change the way she feels
                             LAadd9    SOL6
But you could put your arms around her
SI4 SI7+
    I know you want to live yourself
                          LAadd9
But could you forgive yourself
                SOL6
If you left her just the way you found her?
SI7+
 I stand in front of you
        
I'll take the force of the blow

You're a boy and I'm a girl
                           SI7/4  SOL7+/SI
But you know you can lean on me
SI7+
 And I don't have no fear
                     LAadd9
I'll take on any man here
                        SOL7+
Who says that's not the way it should be
SI7+
 I stand in front of you

 She's a girl and you're a boy
                    LAadd9       SOL7+
Sometimes you look so small, you look so small

SI7+
 I've got a baby of your own
                 LAadd9
When your baby's grown, she'll be the one
   SOL7+
To catch you when you fall
