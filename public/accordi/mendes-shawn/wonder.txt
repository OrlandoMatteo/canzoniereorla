       MI  FA#m  DO#m  LA LAm

  MI                    
I wonder if I’m being real
FA#m                                    
Do I speak my truth or do I filter how I feel?
  DO#m
I wonder, wouldn’t it be nice
   LA                       
To live inside a world that isn’t black and white?
  MI              
I wonder, what it’s like to be my friends
FA#m                                
Hope that they don’t think I forget about them
  DO#m      LA
I wonder, I wonder
MI                 
Right before I close my eyes
    FA#m
The only thing that’s on my mind
     DO#m
Been dreaming that you feel it too
  LA               LAm                 MI     FA#m
I wonder what it’s like to be loved by you, yeah
                       DO#m
I wonder what it’s like
  LA                                 
I wonder what it’s like to be loved by

  MI 
I wonder, why I’m so afraid
   FA#m                       
Of saying something wrong, I never said I was a saint
  DO#m
I wonder, when I cry into my hands
       LA                                LAm
I’m conditioned to feel like it makes me less of a man
      MI
And I wonder if some day you’ll be by my side
    FA#m
And tell me that the world will end up alright
DO#m      LA  LAm
  I wonder, I wonder
MI
Right before I close my eyes
    FA#m
The only thing that’s on my mind
     DO#m
