There's a fragrance of love in the air
                                SIm
It's penetrating far deep in my heart
                                  FA#7
And the star it was reborn in the sky
                              SIm
And it died the day she went away

I feel the sound of a thousand colours

Which paints this scene this act of love

Now before me a cemetery do I see
                                     SIm
Where all the arms of war are buried deep
                                FA#7
And from the heavens descends a grand feast

Where all the nations of the world are united
