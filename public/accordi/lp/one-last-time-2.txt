
      SOL#m
I'm a princess cut from marble, 
       
smoother than a storm
        DO#5
And the scars that mark my body, 

they're silver and gold
   RE#
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones
   SOL#m
It keeps my veins hot, 
                         
the fires find a home in me
                                      DO#5
I move through town, I'm quiet like a fire
       SOL#m                               RE#5
And my necklace is of opal, I tie it and untie it
        SOL#m
And our people talk to me, but nothing ever hits
   SI
So people talk to me, 
            FA#
and all the voices just burn holes

               SOL#m
I'm going in (ooh)
                                     RE#m
This is the start of how it all ever ends
                                       
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
FA#         
 I'm speeding up and this is the
DO#m
Red, orange, 
               RE#m                    SOL#m
yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
                                 RE#m
We rip the start, the colors disappear
 
I never watch the stars there's so much down here
FA#                        
 So I just try to keep up with them
DO#m
Red, orange, 
               RE#m                   SOL#m       
yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart


I dream all year, 
                         DO#5             
but they're not the same kinds
        SOL#m
And the shivers move down my shoulder 
                 RE#5
blades in double time
        SOL#m
And now people talk to me 
                            
I'm slipping out of reach now
SI                               FA#
People talk to me, and all their faces blur
             SOL#m
But I got my fingers laced together 

and I made a little prison
        FA#
And I'm locking up everyone 
                           SOL#m
that ever laid a finger on me

               SOL#m
I'm going in (ooh)
                                     RE#m
This is the start of how it all ever ends
                                          
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
FA#                          
 I'm speeding up and this is the
DO#m
Red, orange, 
               RE#m                   SOL#m
yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
                                 RE#m
We rip the start, the colors disappear
 
I never watch the stars there's 
                 FA#
so much down here

So I just try to keep up with them
DO#m
Red, orange, 
               RE#m                  SOL#m
yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
                RE#m      
And this is the red, orange, 
 
yellow flicker beat
                  FA#
Sparking up my heart...
                DO#m
And this is the red, orange, 
               RE#m                 SOL#m
yellow flicker beat-beat-beat-beat  mmm
