SOLb          REb    MIbm7        REb/FA
Said a lot of words along the way
  SOLb       REb MIbm7         REb/FA
I meant them all while we reigned
    SOLb               REb    MIbm7       REb/FA
But shores of love get beaten by the waves 
    SOLb         REb    MIbm7             REb/FA
and after it was done I wish I'd saved time

SOLb    REb MIbm7   REb/FA

SOLb     REb   MIbm7       REb/FA
One less spark from a flame
SOLb     REb   MIbm7     REb/FA
One more heart beat away
  SOLb              REb     MIbm7       REb/FA
I think I lost your scent after the rain
     SOLb              REb         MIbm7       
I'll find you when our paths cross by the gold mines

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah
SOLb               REb    MIbm7                     REb/FA 
Some day in the sky we'll see the same sun on the rise 
SOLb               REb
yeah  Wherever you go
    MIbm7
Far as Tokyo

Aching with a debt never paid
SOLb   REb    MIbm7       
Horses broken and splayed
SOLb             REb          MIbm7       REb/FA
Breathing half a breath since you're away
    SOLb                REb       MIbm7             REb/FA 
But while your blood is warm I'll keep the home fires
