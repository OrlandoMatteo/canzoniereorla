FA     

                      FA     FA/MI
I’ve been looking for answers
                      REm    DO6
I’ve been looking for change
                      SIb     DO
I’ve been looking for dancers
                     REm
In the middle of the rain
                  FA   DO/MI
Might seem a mile away
                REm   DO
It might seem insane
               SIb        DO
You could be a smile away
                  REm
Could you feel my pain
SIb  
How do I reach you
DO   
What’s underneath you
REm                        DO
Keeping you safe and sound
SIb 
Found what I’m chasing
DO 
 Heart’s racing
FA                                
 When you’re around it feels like

FA DO/MI REm   DO
An-gels  over me
SIb         DO           REm    
 I’ve never seen them before
           FA DO/MI REm   DO
But I feel an-gels  over me
            SIb             DO
I hear them sing I love you more, 
           REm              FA/LA  SIb  DO
I love you more, I love you mo---------re
REm                          SIb  DO  FA
 I love you more, I love you mo-------re

                    FA      DO/MI
Got the keys to the kingdom
                   REm
And it felt like a cage
LAm                   SIb
I had to look for the wisdom
DO                 REm
Right there on the page
            FA                   DO/MI
And are you kings and queens and in betweens
REm      LAm7
 We’re okay
        SIb             DO      REm
Staying higher than the mezzanine

We’re okay
SIb 
How do I reach you
DO
What’s underneath you
REm                       DO6
Keeping you safe and sound
SIb
 If you see me
DO
 Do they see me?
FA
 When you’re around it feels like

FA DO/MI REm   DO
An-gels  over me
SIb         DO           REm    
 I’ve never seen them before
           FA DO/MI REm   DO
But I feel an-gels  over me
            SIb             DO
I hear them sing I love you more, 
           REm              FA/LA  SIb  DO  REm
I love you more, I love you mo------------re

     SIb     DO        REm
It’s only a case of denial
     SIb          LAm      REm
That messes with my inner child
        SIb            DO
But you bring out the best in me 
    FA      DO/MI REm  DO
and fill me with ecstasy
     SIb        DO        REm
Like I haven’t seen in a while
      FA 
I see angels

When you’re around it feels like

FA DO/MI REm   LAm/DO
An-gels  over me
SIb         LAm7        SOLm7/9   
 I’ve never seen them before
           FA DO/MI REm   DO6
But I feel an-gels  over me
            SIb             DO
I hear them sing I love you more, 
           REm             
I love you more, I love you more...
