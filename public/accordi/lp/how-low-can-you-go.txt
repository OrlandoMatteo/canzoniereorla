I’ve never seen a diamond in the flesh

I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies

And I’m not proud of my address
        
In the torn up town, no post code envy
           
But every song’s like:

RE
Gold teeth  Grey Goose

Tripping in the bathroom

Bloodstains  Ball gowns

Trashing the hotel room
DO                           SOL
We don’t care, we’re driving Cadillacs in our dreams

But everybody’s like:
RE
Crystal  Maybach

Diamonds on your timepiece

Jet planes  Islands

Tigers on a gold leash
DO                       SOL
We don’t care, we aren’t caught up in your love affair

                   RE
And we’ll never be royals (royals)

It don’t run in our blood
          DO
That kind of lux just ain’t for us, 
           SOL
we crave a different kind of buzz
               RE
Let me be your ruler (ruler)

You can call me queen bee
              DO                
And baby I’ll rule, I’ll rule, I’ll rule, I’ll rule
SOL                       RE
  Let me live that fantasy

               RE
My friends and I we’ve cracked the code
             
We count our dollars on the train to the party
              
And everyone who knows us knows
                    
That we’re fine with this, we didn’t come from money
