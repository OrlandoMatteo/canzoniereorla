Every day, so many drinks

Such pretty flowers, so tell me

Since you went away I've been hanging around
                        SOL
I've been wondering why I'm feeling down
          DO             REm7
You went away, it should make me feel better

 At night, the people come and go
              LAm                FA
They talk too fast, and walk too slow
                          MIm
Chasing time from hour to hour
           LAm                  FA
I pour the drinks and crush the flowers
             MIm                   LAm
What have I, what have I done to deserve this?
