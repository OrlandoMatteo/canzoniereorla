 I came across a cache of old photos
  MIbm7
And invitations to teenage parties
FAm                       
"Dress in white" one said, with quotations
 MIbm7                        
From someone's wife, a famous writer
      SOLb/LAb LAb
In my 19-------20's
REb
 When you're young, you find inspiration
SOLb6
 In anyone who's ever gone


SI
 And opened up a closing door
SOL#m                           SOL#
 She said we were never feeling bored

                     LA7+         SI
'Cause we were never being boring
                SOL#m7              DO#m7
We had too much time to find for ourselves
                  LA7+        SI
And we were never being boring
                  SOL#m7
We dressed up and fought, 
                   DO#m7
then thought make amends
                  LA7+            SOL#m7
And we were never holding back or worried that
FA#m7                 MI7+
Time would come to an end

 When I went, I left from the station
      MIbm7
With a haversack and some trepidation
FAm
 Someone said If you're not careful
       MIbm7                                 
You'll have nothing left and nothing to care for
      SOLb/LAb LAb
In my 19-------20's

 But I sat back and looking forward
  SOLb6
My shoes were high and I had scored


SI
 I'd bolted through a closing door
SOL#m                                  SOL#
 And I would never find myself feeling bored

                     LA7+         SI
'Cause we were never being boring
                SOL#m7              DO#m7

Time would come to an end
               LA7+         SOL#m7
We were always hoping that, looking back
          FA#m7            MI7+
You could always rely on a friend

 Now I sit with different faces
  MIbm7
In rented rooms and foreign places
FAm
 All the people I was kissing
MIbm7
 Some are here and some are missing
      SOLb/LAb LAb
In my 19-------90's
REb
 I never dreamed that I would get to be
SOLb6
 The creature that I always meant to be


SI                 
 But I thought in spite of dreams
SOL#m             FA#4                SOL#
 You'd be sitting somewhere here with me

                     LA7+         SI
