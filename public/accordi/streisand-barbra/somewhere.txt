    Lately baby, I've been thinking
    SIm7      DO#m7   SIm7
How good it was when you were here
LA7+     SIm7               LA7+    SIm7
 And it ain't the wine that I been drinking
LA7+ SIm7           LA7+    SIm7
 For once I feel my head is clear

RE7+  MI                DO#m7              RE7+  
  But early this morning, when I opened up my eyes
         MI             DO#m7          RE7+
That old lonesome feeling took me by surprise
            MI              DO#m7      RE7+
I guess you meant more to me than I realized
                            MI                  
The love we had stays on my mind
    DO#m7                   RE7+                 
The love we had stays on my mind

LA7+   SIm7 LA7+          SIm7    LA7+
  And boy, I've been remembering
    SIm7             LA7+      SIm7  
The good times that we used to share
  LA7+ SIm7                  LA7+       SIm7   LA7+
My     thoughts of you don't have an ending
                SIm7    LA7+   SIm7
And memories of you are everywhere

RE7+        MI             DO#m7          RE7+
 But why should I tell you, it's not your concern
        MI 
You win some, you lose some
          DO#m7         RE7+
Well I've lost and I've learned
            MI               DO#m7
It's just that I'm so lonely
        RE7+
With no place to turn
                   MI  FA#m
And here at the end, I find
         RE           DO#7
The love we had stays on my mind

FA#m         MI
Girl, if you were nearer
FA#m       MI
If you had a mirror
FA#m      MI             FA#m   DO#m7
Maybe you could count my tears
FA#m       MI
And if you were nearer
FA#m         MI
It would all be clearer
FA#m       MI            FA#m
How I wish that you were here

SIm7                     MI7/6
How I wish that you were here
SIm7                     RE/MI
How I wish that you were here

LA7+  SIm7  LA7+  SIm7

LA7+  SIm7       LA7+   SIm7  LA7+
  And baby boy I was tired
       SIm7  LA7+       SIm7
So I laid down to dream for a little while
LA7+   SIm7          LA7+        SIm7
But lately I've been so, so uninspired
LA7+         SIm7    LA7+     SIm7
 Without the comfort of your smile

RE7+      MI               DO#m7
  But I'm not complaining
           RE7+    
Cuz that's how it goes
               MI              DO#m7
There's always some heartache
              RE7+
In this world I suppose
          MI           DO#m7
But you can't imagine
      RE7+
But nobody knows
                            RE/MI
The love we had stays on my mind
    DO#m7               RE7+
The love we had stays on my mind
                             MI
The love we had stays on my mind
    DO#m7               RE7+
The love we had stays on my mind
