Your words cut rather deeply
        LA
They're just some other lies
    RE
I'm hiding from a distance
     LA
I've got to pay the price
  SOLadd9
Defending all against it
  LA
I really don't know why
         SIm7
You're obsessed with all my secrets
    LA4
You always make me cry
    SOLadd9
You seem to wanna hurt me
   LA4
No matter what I do
    RE                RE/DO#
I'm telling just a couple
        SIm7           LA
But somehow it gets to you
         SOLadd9        
But I've learned to get revenge
      LA             SIm7          SOLadd9
And I swear you'll experience that some day

MIm7
Kinda invisible
    SOL         LA
You don't sense my stay
RE                 LA
Not really hiding, not like a shadow
     MIm7                          SIm7 LA
Just thought I would join you for one day

I'm not trying to avoid you
           LA
Just don't wanna hear your voice
         RE
When you call me up so often
        LA4
I don't really have a choice
       SOLadd9
You're talking like you know me
    LA4
And wanna be my friend
    SIm7
But that's really too late now
        LA/DO#
I won't try it once again
        SOLadd9
You may think that I'm a loser
     LA4
That I don't really care
        RE                   RE/DO#
You may think that it's forgotten
    SIm7           LA
But you should be aware
            SOLadd9
'Cause I've learned to get revenge
     LA             SIm7          SOLadd9
And I swear you'll experience that some day
