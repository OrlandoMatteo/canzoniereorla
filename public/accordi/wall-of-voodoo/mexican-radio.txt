SOL               FA
 I feel a hot wind on my shoulder
RE5                 FA
 And the touch of a world that is older
SOL                 FA
 Turn the switch and check the number
RE5                  FA

SOL                FA
 I hear the talking of the dj
RE5                    DO
 Can't understand just what does he say?

 I wish I was in Tiajuana

Eating barbequed iguana

I'd take requests on the telephone

I'm on a wavelength far from home
