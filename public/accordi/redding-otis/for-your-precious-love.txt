DO                  LAm
Your precious love
                  FA
Means more to me
SOL                     DO
Than any love, than any love could ever be
                       LAm
For when I wanted you
                             FA
I was so lonely, and so blue
            SOL
That's what love, 
                        DO
that's what love really made me do
                                 
And darling, oh they keep saying
     LAm
That our love won't grow now
          FA 
But honey I wanna tell them
      SOL
And I just wanna show them
           DO
How in the world do they know that?
                           
If only all, all night long
            LAm                      
For as long as you've been in love with me now
           FA                   
I know our love will grow wider
    SOL
And so deeper
          DO              LA
Than any, any other seen
