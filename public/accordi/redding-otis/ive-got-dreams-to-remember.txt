An old...   man..... turned ninety-eight
           FA#/LA#  SIadd9  FA#/LA#       SOL#m7
He won the lottery..... and died the next day
     FA#/LA#   SIadd9   FA#/LA#     SOL#m7
It's a black.. fly.. in your Chardonnay
       FA#/LA#   SIadd9       FA#/LA#     SOL#m7
It's a death row pardon.. two minutes too late.
         FA#/LA#  SIadd9        FA#/LA#  SOL#m7
Isn't it ironic...... don't you think?

             FA#   SI         FA#     SOL#m7
It's like rain....... on your wedding day
            FA#   SI             FA#     SOL#m7
It's a free ride.... when you've already paid
                FA#   SI
It's the good advice....
         FA#         SOL#m7
that you just didn't take
    LA           MI               FA#
And who would've thought. it figures...

Mister Play it safe was afraid to fly
              FA#/LA# SIadd9
He packed his suit____case
               FA#/LA#    SOL#m7
and kissed his kids goodbye...
              FA#/LA#    SIadd9
He waited his whole damn life...
        FA#/LA#   SOL#m7
just to take that flight
           FA#/LA#       SIadd9
and as the plane crashed down he thought..
     FA#/LA#    SOL#m7
Well isn't this nice.
          FA#/LA#  SIadd9       FA#/LA#  SOL#m7

A traffic jam when you're already late
     FA#/LA# SIadd9       FA#/LA#   SOL#m7
A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
              FA#/LA#  SIadd9
It´s like ten thousand spoons
             FA#/LA#   SOL#m7
when all you need is a knife
     FA#/LA#               SIadd9
It´s meeting the man of my dreams
                     FA#/LA#   SOL#m7 
And then meeting his beautiful wife
          FA#/LA#  SIadd9       FA#/LA#  SOL#m7
Isn't it ironic...... don't you think?
