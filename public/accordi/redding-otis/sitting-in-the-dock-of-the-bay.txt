Sittin' in the morning sun
        DO                       LA7
I'll be sittin' when the evening comes
SOL                     SI7
Watching the ships roll in
       DO                    LA7
Then I watch them roll away again, yeah
    SOL                        MI7
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
             SOL        MI7
Watchin' the tide roll away, ooh
         SOL                        LA7
I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
        SOL     MI
Wastin' time

  SOL              SI7
I left my home in Georgia
DO                    LA7
Headed for the Frisco Bay
    SOL                 SI7
Cuz I've had nothing to live for
              DO                      LA7
And look like nothing's gonna come my way
                  SOL                    MI7
So, I'm just gon' sit on the dock of the bay
             SOL        MI7
Watchin' the tide roll away, ooh
    SOL                        LA7
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
        SOL   MI
Wastin' time

SOL   RE     DO
 Looks like nothing's gonna change
SOL  RE     DO
  Everything still remains the same
SOL RE            DO         SOL
  I can't do what ten people tell me to do
FA                  RE7
 So I guess I'll remain the same, listen

SOL                     SI7
Sittin' here resting my bones
         DO                         LA7
And this loneliness won't leave me alone, listen
SOL                  SI7
Two thousand miles I roam
        DO                 LA7
Just to make this dock my home, now
              SOL                  MI7
I'm just gon' sit at the dock of a bay
             SOL        MI7
Watchin' the tide roll away, ooh
SOL                        LA7
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
        SOL    MI
Wastin' time

SOL
