I was born by a river in this little old tent
  SIbm                 FAm                          
Oh just like this river I've been running ever since
LAb              SIbm       REb
It's been a long, long time coming
      DO7         FAm
But I know, but I know a change is gotta come
   LAb
Oh yes it is    On my!
                             
It's been too hard living, oh my
                      SIbm
And I'm afraid to die
                             FAm
I don't know what's up there
       
Beyond the clouds
     LAb          SIbm        REb
It's been a long   long time coming
      DO7             FAm
But I know, but I know a change is gotta come
   LAb
Oh yes it is   On my!

SIbm                        LAb
  There was a time I would go to my brother
SIbm                                 FAm          SIbm
  I asked my brother, "Will you help me please?"
                                  FAm               
He turned me down and then I ask my dear mother, oh
SIb7
 I said "Mother!"
                            MIb
I said "Mother! I'm down on my knees"
            LAb
It's been a time that I thought
                                       SIbm
Lord this couldn't last for very long

But somehow I thought 
                FAm            
I was still able to try to carry on
     LAb          SIbm         REb
It's been a long,  long time coming
         DO7 FAm
But I know     a change is gonna come
    LAb         SIbm
Oh, yes it is
                                      LAb       
Just like I said, I went to my little bitty brother, 
                    SIbm
my littele brother
                                    FAm      SIbm
I asked my brother "Brother help me please?"
                                FAm                 
He turned me down and then I go to my little mother, 
                SIb7
my dear mother

I said "Mother!"
                         MIb
I said "Mother! I'm down on my knees"
                LAb  
But there was a time that I thought

Lord this couldn't last for very long
  SIbm
But somehow I thought 
              FAm                    
I was still able to try to carry on
     LAb          SIbm              REb
It's been a long,  long time coming
          DO7 FAm                                 
But I know,     but I know a change is gotta come
                LAb
Oh yes it will
                    REb
So tired of standing by myself
         DO7                FAm                  LAb
You know that I know that a change is gotta come...
