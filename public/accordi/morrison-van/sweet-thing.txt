FA#m   LAadd9  LA6 LA7+  MI

          FA#m              
And I will stroll the merry way
             LAadd9        LA6 LA7+  MI
And jump the hedges first
                     FA#m
And I will drink the clear
                          LAadd9    LA6 LA7+  MI
Clean water for to quench my thirst
            FA#m
And I shall watch the ferry-boats
            LAadd9    LA6 LA7+  MI
And they'll get high
     FA#m
On a bluer ocean
           LAadd9        LA6 LA7+  MI
Against tomorrow's sky
          FA#m                LAadd9  LA6  MI
And I will never grow so old again
           FA#m
And I will walk and talk
           LAadd9              MI
In gardens all wet with rain

  LA                        MI
Oh sweet thing, sweet thing
           LA            MI
Oh, oh, oh,  sweet thing
                 LA             MI
My, my, my, my, my sweet thing...

            FA#m
And I shall drive my chariot
LA                          MI
Down your streets and cry
     FA#m              LA
'Hey, it's me, I'm dynamite
                       MI
And I don't know why'
        FA#m 
And you shall take me strongly
LA                  MI
In your arms again
FA#m    
 And I will not remember
LA                         MI
That I even felt the pain
         FA#m
We shall walk and talk
                 LA                    MI
In gardens all misty and wet with rain
     FA#m                LA
And I will never, never, never
                   MI
Grow so old again

LA                           MI
 Oh sweet thing, sweet thing
           LA            MI
Oh, oh, oh,  sweet thing
                   LA   LA7+  MI
My, my, my, my, my... 

           FA#m
And I will raise my hand up
  LA                    MI
Into the night time sky
FA#m
 And count the stars
LA                         MI
That's shining in your eye
FA#m                        LA    
Just to dig it all an' not to wonder
                  MI
That's just fine
            FA#m
And I'll be satisfied
       LA                         MI
Not to read in between the lines
    FA#m
And I will walk and talk
   LA                         MI
In gardens all wet with rain
             FA#m
And I will never, ever, ever, ever
 LA               MI
Grow so old again
              LA           MI  
Oh sugar baby, sweet thing...
LA           MI
 Sugar-baby...
LA             MI
  sweet thing...

LA    MI
