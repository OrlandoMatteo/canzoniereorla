LAm  SOL/LA  LAm  MIm7

           LAm
I kept the right ones out
            SOL/LA
And let the wrong ones in
       DO7
Had an angel of mercy
                         FA
to see me through all my sins
           FAm6/LAb
There were times in my life
           DO/SOL
When I was goin' insane
FA#m7/5-
Tryin' to walk through
    FA
The pain
       LAm
When I lost my grip
      SOL/LA
And I hit the floor
        DO7     
Yeah, I thought I could leave 
                         FA
but couldn't get out the door
      FAm6/LAb
I was so sick and tired
   DO/SOL
Of livin' a lie
      FA#m7/5-
I was wishin that I
      FA
Would die

      DO     MIm
It's Amazing
         FA
With the blink of an eye
    MIm             SOL   SOL7
you finally see the light
      DO   MIm
It's Amazing
         FA
When the moment arrives
         MIm              SOL   SOL7
that you know you'll be alright
      FA MIm
It's Ama-zing
        RE7
And I'm sayin' a prayer
        SOL7               DO    MIm/SI
for the desperate hearts tonight

     LAm
That one last shot's
              RE7
a Permanent Vacation
    FA               FA/SOL
And how high can you fly
            DO     MIm/SI
with broken wings?
LAm
Life's a journey
           RE7
not a destination
      FA
And I just can't tell
                   SOL    SOL7
just what tomorrow brings

            LAm
You have to learn to crawl
           SOL/LA
Before you learn to walk
      DO7
But I just couldn't listen to all
               FA
that righteous talk, oh yeah
      FAm6/LAb
I was out on the street,
     DO/SOL
Just tryin' to survive
FA#m7/5-
Scratchin' to stay
 FA
Alive

      DO     MIm
It's Amazing
         FA
With the blink of an eye
    MIm             SOL   SOL7
you finally see the light
            DO   MIm
Oh... It's Amazing
         FA
When the moment arrives
         MIm              SOL   SOL7
that you know you'll be alright
      FA MIm
It's Ama-zing
        RE7
And I'm sayin' a prayer
        SOL7               DO
for the desperate hearts tonight
REm7                                MIm   FA   
Desperate hearts, desperate hearts
