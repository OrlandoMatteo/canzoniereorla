She said "I've got a problem with your shoes and your tunes
                 
But I might move in" and
DOadd9/MI  FAadd9
"I thought that you were straight, now I'm wondering"
LAm7       SOL4

DOadd9/MI FAadd9     LAm7

 It's not about reciprocation it's just all about me

A sycophantic, prophetic, Socratic junkie wannabe

There's so much skin to see

A simple Epicurean Philosophy
        FAadd9
