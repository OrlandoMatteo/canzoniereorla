SIm   LA SOL SIm   LA SOL

SIm         LA             SOL         SIm
 I find the map and draw a straight line
     LA                SOL       SIm
Over rivers, farms and state lines
             LA              SOL     SIm
The distance from A to where you'd B
          LA                  SOL   SIm
It's only finger lengths that I see
            LA  SOL  SIm
I touch the pla---ce
                    LA  SOL  SIm
Where I'd find your fa---ce
              LA   SOL  SIm
My fingers in creases
                LA  SOL  SIm
Of distant dark places
          LA             SOL     SIm
I hang my coat up in the first bar
            LA                    SOL  SIm
There is no peace that I've found so far
             LA            SOL   SIm
The laughter penetrates my silence
           LA                SOL    SIm
As drunken men find flaws in science
                   LA  SOL  SIm
Their words mostly noises
                 LA  SOL  SIm
Ghosts with just voices
                 LA  SOL  SIm
Your words in my memory
               LA  SOL  SIm
Are like music to me

               RE
And miles from where you are
 RE/LA           SOL               SIm
I lay down on the cold ground and I
                      RE
I pray that something picks me up
   RE/LA                DOadd9
And sets me down in your warm arms

SIm    LA              SOL   SIm
 After I have traveled so far
             LA          SOL      SIm
We'd set the fire to the third bar
                LA            SOL   SIm
We'd share each other like an island
       LA                 SOL    SIm
Until exhausted close our eyelids
                  LA  SOL  SIm
And dreaming pick up from
                  LA    SOL  SIm
The last place we left off
                  LA  SOL  SIm
Your soft skin is weeping
                LA/DO# SOL
A joy you can't keep  in

               RE
And miles from where you are
 RE/LA           SOL               SIm
I lay down on the cold ground and I
                      RE
I pray that something picks me up
   RE/LA                DOadd9       SIm
And sets me down in your warm arms
               RE
And miles from where you are
 RE/LA           SOL               SIm
I lay down on the cold ground and I
                      RE
I pray that something picks me up
   RE/LA                DOadd9      SOL
And sets me down in your warm arms
