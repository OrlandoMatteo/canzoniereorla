MIm                 
I live deep in symmetry
             
In my anonymity
                             SI7
Je t'adore, ma vie tr√®s difficile

I'll take hours to perfect

In this room of disconnect
                              MIm    SI7
All I need are mannequins and me
MIm
Fabric straight from arm to arm

Rescuing my heart from harm
                             SI7
All that I can see speaks of finesse

Radically, my fashion dreams

Costumed men and models scream
                                   MIm   
Fame is nothing more than force, duress
LAm                           MIm
Let them comment of my cold behavior
LAm                            SOL
Beauty has a price that's paid by greed

SI7     MIm
Where I am

I will stand alone
                 SI7
I don't need the money
             MIm
I don't want for much

These two hands

Never will they mourn
                   SI7
I'd rather you not love me
                DO         SI7 MIm
Before you want too much

MIm
Travelling, I do forget

Every single last regret
                        SI7
Solitarily, there is one quest

To my cause, I will devote

All my passion, note for note
                             MIm
To create and fill this emptiness

Freedom that lies underneath
                  
Let it fall and let them breathe
                             SI7
Bodies are not meant to be so bound

I'm the dancer of the dance

Let the socialites advance
                               MIm
Let them love me when I'm not around
LAm                                 MIm
When they speak their words of my demeanor
LAm                            SOL
I will let them fuel what they fire

SI7     MIm
Where I am

I will stand alone
                   SI7
I don't need the money
                 MIm
I don't want for much

These two hands
                  
Never will they mourn
                   SI7
I'd rather you not love me
                DO        SI7 MIm
Before you want too much

LAm                    MIm/SOL
Fading as I live in isolation
SI7                             MIm
Information spreads that I have left

FA#m7/5-  SOL6

    LAm                  MIm
For them let it be an education
          RE              DO6          SI7
Those who cherish me will not let them forget

MIm      SI7  MIm      SI7  DO

        MIm
Where I am

I will stand alone
                 SI7
I don't need the money
              MIm
I don't want for much
          
These two hands
        
Never will they mourn
                   SI7
I'd rather you not love me
                DO        SI7 MIm
Before you want too much
