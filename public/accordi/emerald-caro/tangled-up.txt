           REm        LAm
I took the perfect avenue, 
         MI7             LAm
down the road to both of you
         REm    LAm
Did I go dutch?
            MI7   LAm
This is too much!
             REm          LAm
With all the money in the world
          MI7            LAm
You could never buy this girl
       REm   LAm         MI7   LAm
Quite enough, it will be tough
     REm             LAm
If romancing me with neons 
   MI7                  LAm
is something you should do
        REm              LAm          MI7
May the letters write in luminous, in-lou

           REm
And get me wicked up
LAm
Shake it up
MI7     LAm
Tangled up
             REm          LAm
You could be breaking up, making up
MI7     LAm
Tangled up
             REm
You can't be faking it,
LAm       MI7     LAm     
Making it from my love
              REm      LAm          MI7     LAm
With all this tragedy, don't get me tangled up

I can't separate your sins,
             MI7                LAm
To me you're acting like you're twins
          REm   LAm
This is a mess,
          MI7   LAm
Is this a test?
         REm          LAm
How many guesses do I get?
          MI7           LAm
Till only one of you is left
                 REm   LAm
You're quite the same,
              MI7  LAm
If love's the gain
  REm          LAm     MI7          LAm
I want to see emotions coloring the sky
       REm           LAm           MI7
To the point it will make me wanna cry

          REm
And get me wicked up

Treating girls like a yo-yo 
     LAm      LA7        REm    SIb7 LA7
is a no no of monumental kind
   REm6+            
If playing with your string 
    LAm
had lanced to be your thing
     SI7                          MI7
It's easy to say to both, oh nevermind
