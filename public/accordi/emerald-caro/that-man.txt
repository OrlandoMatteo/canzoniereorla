       SOL#m LA#m7/5- SI6 

         RE#7          SOL#m LA#m7/5- SI6
I'm in a little bit of trouble
    RE#7       SOL#m LA#m7/5- SI6 RE#7
And I'm in real deep
           SOL#m          LA#m7/5- SI6 RE#7
From the beginning to the end
          SI6         RE#7      SOL#m LA#m7/5- SI6 
He was no more than a friend to me
               RE#7      SOL#m LA#m7/5- SI6
The thought is makin' me hazy
          RE#7   SOL#m LA#m7/5- SI6 RE#7
I think I better sit  down
                SOL#m        LA#m7/5- 
'Cause like the sweetest serenade
       SI6               
Bet he knows he's got 
   RE#7      SOL#m LA#m7/5- SI6 RE#7
it made with me
DO#m6+
Twisting 'round on a carousel

This speeds' too much to stop

One second I'm thinkin' I'm feeling the lust
    RE#7
And then I feel a lot

SOL#m    LA#m7/5- SI6    RE#7
Ooh that man is   like a flame
    SOL#m    LA#m7/5-     SI6    RE#7
And ooh that man plays me like a game
   SOL#m LA#m7/5- SI6     RE#7
My only  sin is   I can't win
SOL#m       LA#m7/5-  SI6 RE#7
Ooh I wanna love that man
SOL#m    LA#m7/5- SI6   RE#7
Ooh that man   is on my list
    SOL#m    LA#m7/5- SI6   RE#7

         RE#7          SOL#m LA#m7/5- SI6 RE#7
Now it's like I'm on a mission
       RE#7 SOL#m LA#m7/5- SI6 RE#7
Headed every----where
          SOL#m          LA#m7/5- SI6 RE#7
And if it takes a little long
       SI6            RE#7  
And it feels a little wrong, 
   SOL#m LA#m7/5- SI6 
who   cares?
        RE#7       SOL#m LA#m7/5- SI6 
My baby fits the description
            RE#7  SOL#m LA#m7/5- SI6 RE#7
And does it easi--------ly
         SOL#m        LA#m7/5- 
A little Gable, some Astaire
        SI6          RE#7   SOL#m LA#m7/5- SI6 RE#7
When he dances I can hardly breathe
DO#m6+
Someone call a doctor

I need some help to rescue me

One second I'm thinkin' I must be lost
       RE#7
And he keeps on findin' me

SOL#m    LA#m7/5- SI6    RE#7

Parlato:
"You know, I've been calling you 
for about two days now and I eh
I wanted to see you darling, 
I really do, you know, because
I think of you and eh
All of me kind of goes 
a little bit crazy, so eh
I believe it's a matter darling
You should phone me, and we will have
A night at the Cos Bar 
that neither of us will ever forget
A beautiful evening of love, 
lust and paradise
You can make it nice, call me back
On Riverside at 42239
Ciao ciao"
