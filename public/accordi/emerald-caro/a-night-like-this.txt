       DO#m6+

               DO#m6+
From where you are

You see the smoke start to arise
             SOL#7
Where they play cards and you walk over
              
Softly moving passed the guards
                
The stakes are getting higher
        DO#m6+
You can feel it in your heart
             
He calls you bluff
                  
He is the ace you never thought
            SOL#7
He played that much

And now it's more than all this cards
        
You want to touch
              
You never know if winning this
      DO#m   
Could really be enough
       FA#m/LA         SOL#7
Take a look Beyond the moon
         DO#m
You see the stars
    FA#m/LA           
And when you look around


    SOL#7         DO#
You know the room by heart

             RE#m7/4
I have never dreamed it
              SOL#7                DO#
Have you ever dreamed a night like this
           RE#m7/4
I cannot believe it
            SOL#7            DO#        
I may never see a night like this
                    RE#m7/4       SOL#7
When everything you think is incomplete
                      DO#                       
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek
               FA#m/LA
Could you ever dream it
             SOL#7
I have never dreamed, 


                     DO#m6+
dreamed a night like this

         DO#m6+
How many times

Have I been waiting by the door
            SOL#7
To hear these chimes

To hear that someone debonaire has just a arrived
                        DO#m6+
And opened up to see my world before my eyes

That silhouette creates an image
                      SOL#7
On the night I can't forget

It has the scent of something special

I can't rest if I resist temptation
      DO#m
Oh, I know for sure that I will lose the bet
  FA#m/LA
I walk away and suddenly it seems
         DO#m
I'm not alone
   FA#m/LA
In front of me he stands


  SOL#7        DO#
I stop, before he goes
