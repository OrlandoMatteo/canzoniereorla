
SOLb                                    REb
 She's been out for a week or a little more
 SOLb
Again and again and again
                    REb
counting all these hours at night
SOLb                       SIbm
 A single cloud is passing by
             REb
Right in the moon behind the way
        SOLb      REb
she always said
SOLb                                   REb
You spin fast in a road that i didn't count?
     SOLb
From time to time it felt like
          REb
we have chosen different roads
SOLb                     SIbm
 Oh the future is gonna be
        REb               SOLb
a new estate for you and me
                         REb
At least, at least in your eyes

Oh I swear

SOLb                             REb   MIbm
Down to the upper side I can see ghost towns
             SIbm
Oh until the morning glows
MIbm            SIbm     FA7               SIbm
Read it in your eyes I believe in my whole lies
SOLb  REb  
Oh

SOLb                         REb
She's been out for sick and change
     SOLb                     
In a land where milk and honey flows
             REb      SOLb
Through all our veins
                             SIbm
What does an old picture tell
               REb               SOLb
I thought i've always stayed the same

At least in your eyes 

SOLb                             REb   MIbm
Down to the upper side I can see ghost towns
             SIbm
Oh until the morning glows
MIbm            SIbm     FA7               SIbm
Read it in your eyes I believe in my whole lies
SOLb                             REb   MIbm
Down to the upper side I can see ghost towns
             SIbm
Oh until the morning glows
MIbm            SIbm     FA7               SIbm
Read it in your eyes I believe in my whole lies
SOLb  REb MIbm  SIbm  MIbm  SIbm  FA7  
Huh

SOLb  REb MIbm  SIbm  MIbm  SIbm  FA7  SIbm

            SIbm
Nothing can hold us

Same way as you can't leave us alone
       
It's easy one more step and my head is gone
  SOLb  REb                  FAm      SIbm  
Serena, all I need and all I want you to
  SOLb     REb            FAm     SIbm     FA7  
Believe me all I need and want you to

Oh i swear

SOLb                             REb   MIbm
Down to the upper side I can see ghost towns
             SIbm
Oh until the morning glows
MIbm            SIbm     FA7               SIbm
Read it in your eyes I believe in my whole lies
SOLb                             REb   MIbm

             SIbm
Oh until the morning glows
MIbm            SIbm     FA7               SIbm
Read it in your eyes I believe in my whole lies
SOLb   MIbm SIbm  MIbm  SIbm  FA7  SIbm
Oh oh

SOLb   MIbm SIbm  MIbm  SIbm  FA7  SIbm

      SOLb            SIbm
Can't read it in your eyes
       FA7          SIbm
In the dead of the night
        SOLb            SIbm
I can't read it in your eyes
    FA7               SIbm
I believe in my whole lies
