SOL#5   FA#5   FA5   MI5 RE#5

SOL#5       FA#5              FA5   MI5 RE#5
 I'm having trouble trying to sleep
SOL#5         FA#5              FA5   MI5 RE#5
 I'm counting sheep but running out
SOL#5          FA#5   FA5      MI5 RE#5
 As time ticks by,     still I try
SOL#5        FA#5            FA5  
 No rest for crosstops in my mind
MI5        RE#5       SOL#5   FA#5   FA5   MI5 RE#5
On my own, here we go

SOL#5   FA#5   FA5   MI5 RE#5

SOL#5         FA#5               FA5   MI5 RE#5
 My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
SOL#5        FA#5            FA5   MI5 RE#5
 Dried up and bulging out my skull
SOL#5        FA#5   FA5         MI5 RE#5
 My mouth is dry,    my face is numb
SOL#5          FA#5           FA5   
 Fucked up and spun out in my room
MI5        RE#5      SOL#5   FA#5   FA5   MI5 RE#5
On my own, here we go

SOL#5   FA#5   FA5   MI5 RE#5

SOL#5       FA#5       FA5   MI5 RE#5
 My mind is set on overdrive
SOL#5         FA#5           FA5   MI5 RE#5
 The clock is laughing in my face
SOL#5      FA#5   FA5        MI5  RE#5
 A crooked spine,  my senses dulled
SOL#5           FA#5   FA5   
 Past the point of delirium
MI5        RE#5      SOL#5   FA#5   FA5   MI5 RE#5
On my own, here we go

SOL#5   FA#5   FA5   MI5 RE#5

SOL#5         FA#5               FA5   MI5 RE#5
 My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed
SOL#5         FA#5           FA5   MI5 RE#5
 Dried up and bulging out my skull
SOL#5        FA#5   FA5         MI5 RE#5
 My mouth is dry,    my face is numb
SOL#5          FA#5           FA5   
 Fucked up and spun out in my room
MI5        RE#5
On my own, here we go...

SOL#5   FA#5   FA5   MI5 RE#5
