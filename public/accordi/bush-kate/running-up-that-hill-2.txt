It doesn't hurt me
               SOLm        LAb  SIb  DOm
Do you want to feel how it feels?
               SOLm                 LAb   SIb  DOm
Do you want to know that it doesn't hurt me?
               SOLm           LAb           SIb
Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making?
LAb MIb FAm    LAb           MIb FAm 
 You,           it's you and me

    LAb
And if I only could,
           SIb
I'd make a deal with God,
        DOm          
And I'd get him to swap our places,
                   LAb
Be running up that road,
                   SIb
Be running up that hill,
                   DOm
Be running up that building
           LAb     SIb    DOm    LAb/DO
If I only could, oh...

LAb    SIb    DOm  

                  LAb     SIb  DOm
You don't want to hurt me,
            SOLm            LAb  SIb  DOm
But see how deep the bullet lies
            SOLm         LAb   SIb  DOm
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder
              SOLm           LAb   SIb  DOm
Ooh, there is thunder in our hearts
                                      LAb SIb DOm
Is there so much hate for the ones we love?
         SOLm        LAb        SIb  LAb/DO                   
Tell me, we both matter, don't we?
   MIb FAm LAb            MIb FAm
You,         it's you and me
LAb           MIb FAm
 It's you and me  won't be unhappy

    LAb
And if I only could,
           SIb

 It's you and me won't be unhappy
LAb          SIb             DOm
"C'mon, baby, c'mon darling,
                           
Let me steal this moment from you now
LAb            SIb
 C'mon, angel, c'mon, c'mon, darling,
