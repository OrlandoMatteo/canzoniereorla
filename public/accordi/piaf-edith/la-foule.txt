 When I look back upon my life
            MIb              LAb
it’s always with a sense of shame
            FAm             SOL
I’ve always been the one to blame
DOm       FAm7             SIb
 For everything I long to do
          MIb               LAb
no matter when or where or who
        FAm             SOL
has one thing in common too

It’s a, it’s a, it’s a, 
       DOm   LAb

               FAm7              SIb
At school they taught me how to be
           MIb                  LAb
so pure in thought and word and deed
     FAm             SOL    DOm
They didn’t quite succeed
         FAm7             SIb
For everything I long to do
          MIb              LAb
no matter when or where or who
        FAm             SOL

Father forgive me
MIbm
 I tried not to do it
SOLm
 Turned over a new leaf
DOm              SIb6        DOm
 then tore right through it
                        MIbm
Whatever you taught me
                     SOLm
I didn’t believe it

Father you fought me
         LAb
‘cause I didn’t care
      SIb              SOL     DOm
and I still don’t understand

          FAm7          SIb
So I look back upon my life
        MIb             LAb
forever with a sense of shame
            FAm             SOL    DOm
I’ve always been the one to blame
         FAm7             SIb    
For everything I long to do

Confiteor Deo omnipotenti vobis
fratres quia peccavi nimis cogitatione, verbo, opere
et omissione. Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa
