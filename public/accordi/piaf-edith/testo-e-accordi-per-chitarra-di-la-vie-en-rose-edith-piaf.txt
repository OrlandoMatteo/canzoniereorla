I'm wide awake
          SOLm7/4  SIbadd9  FA  DO4
I'm wide awake
          SOLm7/4
I'm wide awake
            SIbadd9
Yeah, I was in the dark
      FA
I was falling hard
        DO4
With an open heart
          SOLm7/4
I'm wide awake
          SIbadd9           FA    DO4
How did I read the stars so wrong
          SOLm7/4
I'm wide awake
             SIbadd9
And now it's clear to me
          FA
That everything you see
             DO4
Ain't always what it seems
          SOLm7/4
I'm wide awake
            SIbadd9         FA    DO4
Yeah, I was dreaming for so long
              SOLm7/4
I wish I knew then
            SIbadd9
What I know now
              FA
Wouldn't dive in
             DO4
Wouldn't bow down
        SOLm7/4
Gravity hurts
               SIbadd9
You made it so sweet
            FA
Till I woke up on
DO4
On the concrete

SOLm7   SIb        FA  DO4
Falling from cloud nine
SOLm7    SIb      FA  DO4
Crashing from the high
    SOLm7   SIb  FA    DO4
I'm letting go tonight
    SOLm7   SIb        FA  DO4
I'm falling from cloud nine

          SOLm7/4
I'm wide awake
           SIbadd9
Not losing any sleep
          FA
Picked up every piece
           DO4
And landed on my feet
          SOLm7/4
I'm wide awake
             SIbadd9       FA     DO4
Need nothing to complete myself, no
          SOLm7/4
I'm wide awake
           SIbadd9
Yeah, I am born again
           FA
Out of the lion's den
             DO4
I don't have to pretend
             SOLm7/4
And it's too late
            SIbadd9       FA  DO4
The story's over now, the end
              SOLm7/4
I wish I knew then
            SIbadd9
What I know now
              FA
Wouldn't dive in
             DO4
Wouldn't bow down
        SOLm7/4
Gravity hurts
               SIbadd9
You made it so sweet
            FA
Till I woke up on
DO4
On the concrete

SOLm7   SIb        FA  DO4
Falling from cloud nine
SOLm7    SIb      FA  DO4
Crashing from the high
    SOLm7   SIb  FA    DO4
I'm letting go tonight
    SOLm7   SIb        FA  DO4
I'm falling from cloud nine

SOLm7/4  SIbadd9
 Thunder rumbling
FA       DO         SOLm7/4
 Castles crumbling
     SIbadd9        FA  DO4  SOLm7/4
I am trying to hold on
          SIbadd9      FA
God knows that I tried
       DO4             SOLm7/4
Seeing the bright side
            SIbadd9  FA   DO4
But I'm not blind anymore
          SOLm7/4  SIbadd9  FA  DO4
I'm wide awake
          SOLm7/4  SIbadd9  FA  DO4
I'm wide awake 

SOLm7   SIb        FA  DO4
Falling from cloud nine
SOLm7    SIb      FA  DO4
Crashing from the high
    SOLm7   SIb  FA    DO4
I'm letting go tonight
    SOLm7   SIb        FA  DO4
I'm falling from cloud nine

          SOLm7/4  SIbadd9  FA  DO4
I'm wide awake
          SOLm7/4  SIbadd9  FA  DO4
I'm wide awake
          SOLm7/4  SIbadd9  FA  DO4
I'm wide awake
          SOLm7/4  SIbadd9  FA  DO4
I'm wide awake
          
I'm wide awake
