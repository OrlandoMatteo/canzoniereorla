Lost in the high street, where the dogs run
SIb              MIb    MIb/RE
Roaming suburban boys
DOm                  LAb
Mother's got a hairdo to be done
    SIb                      SOL4
She says they're too old for toys
DOm                  LAb
Stood by the bus stop with a felt pen
SIb              MIb    MIb/RE
In this suburban hell
DOm                LAb
And in the distance a police car
   SIb                SOL4   SOL7/4
To break the suburban spell


DO           LAm7                   REm7

You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight
FA7+ SOL   
In Suburbia


DOm              LAb
 Break the window by the town hall
SIb               MIb     MIb/RE
Listen, the siren screams
DOm                   LAb
There in the distance, like a roll call
SIb                 SOL4   SOL7/4
Of all the suburban dreams


DO           LAm7                   REm7

It's on the front page of the papers
SIb                   MIb   MIb/RE
This is their hour of need
DOm                LAb
Where's a policeman when you need one
   SIb               SOL4  SOL
To blame the colour TV?
