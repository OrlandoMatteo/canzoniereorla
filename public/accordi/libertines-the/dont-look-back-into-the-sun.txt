LAb               MIb
Don't look back into the sun
FAm                    MIb
 Now you know that the time is come
REb                          MIb            LAb  MIb
 And they said that it would never come for you
LAb              MIb
Oh my friend you haven't changed
FAm                MIb
 Looking rough and living strange
      REb              MIb           LAb  MIb
And I know you've got a taste for it too
REb
 They will never forgive you 
                       LAb
but they won't let you go, oh no
REb
 She will never forgive you 
                      MIb
but she won't let you go, oh no

LAb               MIb
Don't look back into the sun
       FAm                         MIb
You've cast your pearls but you're on the run
    REb              MIb               LAb    MIb
And all the lies you said, who did you save?
              LAb                     MIb
And then they played that song at the death disco
   FAm                 MIb
It started fast but it ends so slow
    REb               MIb          LAb  MIb
And all the time it reminded me of you
REb  
 They will never forgive you 
                       LAb
but they won't let you go (let me go)
REb
 She will never forgive you 
                      MIb
but she won't let you go, oh no

REb               
 They will never forgive you 
                       LAb
but they won't let you go (let me go)
REb

                      MIb
but she won't let you go, oh no
