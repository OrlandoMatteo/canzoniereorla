      SOLm                    MIbadd9
I was born in the land of the sun
                   FA
And the tall green grass
      SOLm 
And I don't understand
    MIbadd9              FA    DO
How all this has come to pass
          SOLm                 MIbadd9
How we've come to surround ourselves
            FA      DO
In a sea of thieves
     MIbadd9
In a land without learning
FA               SOLm7     MIb FA DOadd9
Only the fools believe
       SOLm
I went driving last night
MIbadd9           FA    
 On a dark canyon road
        SOLm
Had the sky to myself
MIbadd9        FA    DOadd9
 But I wasn't alo----ne
        SOLm
Had the pain of my lifetime
MIbadd9      FA   DO
 For my company
MIbadd9                FA
How did it end up like this
              SOLm FA/SOL SOLm
For you and me
     MIb 
When love breaks the promise
    SIb          FA
The heart has to keep
   MIb                       SOLm
It leaves only truth here to find
         MIb
When the spirit is crushed
        SIb        FA
And the hurt is so deep
   MIb  SIb/MIb MIb   
Between you and I

SIb        FA/LA             SOLm
 Even when love has come and gone
    REm7                   MIb
And our hearts have moved along
         SIb/FA FA   SIb
I will remem----ber
            FA/LA           SOLm
There was a time we had the trust
         REm7        MIb
And that always was enough
         SIb/FA FA
I will remem----ber

 I will remem-ber you

     SOLm        MIbadd9      FA   
As I open my eyes to one more day
    SOLm               MIbadd9
The wind burns my face
                    FA   DO
As it whispers your na---me
        SOLm              MIbadd9
As it's pulling me forward
            FA    DO
It tears me free
        MIbadd9
And the only thing left
       FA             SOLm FA/SOL SOLm FA/SOL
Is the tears for and me
            MIb       
'Cause when love breaks the promise
    SIb          FA
The heart has to keep

It leaves only truth here to find
         MIb
When the spirit is crushed
