Yeah, they give you this alibi
                                     RE
I don't know 'cause I'm lost in your eyes
 MIm                              RE
I, hope my heart don't break too much
                                DO
When I wake from the ways you touch
                                RE
I'm so weak 'cause I can't get enough
                 MIm

I've been running in a thousand tracks

You said it was L-O-V-E
                  RE
Now we don't even speak

I know you didn't need me

What is all this about?

I didn't come for no clout

I get mines and I'm out

I'll survive any drought, feelings are not allowed
                       
I go all the way down, yeah
MIm
We could go somewhere where we don't get service
REadd9
We can sit back and smoke weed all day shirtless
DO
I keep on going in-out of your cervix
REadd9
That would be perfect
