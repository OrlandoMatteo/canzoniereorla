LAm    DO    SOL    RE

LAm                         DO
 And though I never got her name
                    SOL
Or time to find out anything
                 RE
I loved her just the same
LAm                            DO
 And though I rode a different road
                     SOL
And sang a different song
                      RE
I'll love her till my last breaths gone
FA           DO              SOL
 Like a river made of silver
              LAm
Everyone came running to the scene
FA              DO     
 I was shot down in cold blood
REm             MI7
 By an angel in blue jeans

LAm    DO    SOL    FA    LAm

                         DO
Late that night she got away
                    SOL
I chased her to the turnpike
                        RE
Then lost her where the music never plays
LAm                           DO
 And though I rolled upon the stones 
                  SOL
and fell into the water
                      RE
I'll love her till my judgment day
FA            DO                 SOL
 Like a sunrise made of white lies
               LAm
Everything was nothing as it seems
FA             DO            REm
 I was shot down in cold blood
                MI7
By an angel in blue jeans

LAm    DO    SOL    FA

LAm    DO    SOL    FA

SOL           REm
I hear voices calling all around
FA            
I keep falling down
  LAm                                     SOL
I think my heart could pound right out of me
        REm
I see a million different ways
   FA                     MI7
To never leave this maze alive

LAm                      DO
 I woke up in somebody's arms
                 SOL
Strange and so familiar
                     RE
Where nothing could go wrong
LAm                     DO
 Barely alive or nearly dead
                        SOL
Somehow awake in my own bed
              RE
And there you are

FA            DO            SOL
 Like a highway headed my way
         LAm         
Life is but a dream
FA             DO           REm
 I was shot down by your love
             MI7
My angel in blue jeans...

LAm    DO    SOL    FA

LAm    DO    SOL    FA
