 At the same town miles away
REm7
 A little boy made a wish that day
FA
 That the world would be okay
    DO
And Santa Clause would hear him say

I got dreams and I got love
         REm7
I got my feet on the ground and family above
      FA
Can you send some happiness with my best
       DO
To the rest of the people of east and the west
     
And maybe every once in a while

You give my a grandma a reason to smile

 'Tis the season to smile
     DO
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style
   
And let me meet a girl one day

That wants to spread some love this way

 We can let our souls run free
   DO
And she can open some happiness with me

Your boots have been

I'm gonna show them
