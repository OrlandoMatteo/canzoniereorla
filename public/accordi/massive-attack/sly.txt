 I try to believe what I feel these days
                              LAadd9  MIm7
It makes life much easier for me
                            LAadd9      MIm7
It's hard to decide what is real these days
                             LAadd9  MIm7
When things look so dizzy to me
                 LAadd9
I already know my
           MIm7
Children's children's faces
                         LAadd9  MIm
Voices that I've heard before
                    LAadd9  MIm
There's always more
                    LAadd9  
There's always more
     MIm
Wandering, leaving the sea behind

To my home which everybody owns
     LA   MIm 
Wandering
     LA   MIm
Wandering
                           LA  MIm
Where we can do what we please
     LA  MIm       LA MIm

I feel like a thousand years have passed
                           LAadd9  MIm
I'm younger than I used to be
                            LAadd9  MIm
I feel like the world is my home at last
                       LAadd9  MIm
I know everyone that I meet
 
Somewhere in the music
LA
 I can hear the bells
 MIm                       LA
I heard a thousand years before
               MIm  LAadd9
There's always more
               MIm  LAadd9 MIm
There's always more

Wandering, is this there all there is?

Since I was, since I began to be
     LA  MIm
Wandering
     LA  MIm
Wandering
                           LA  MIm
Where we can do what we please
     LA  MIm      
Wandering
