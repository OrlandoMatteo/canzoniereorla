LAadd9              SIadd9
 I got that feeling
                DO#m
That bad feeling that you don't know
LAadd9                SIadd9
 I don't even know her
               
But I hope that
    DO#m           MI6     FA#m  FA#m9 SI
She comforts you tonight
DO#m             SI/RE# MI6             
 Nobody here that       keeps you in the shade
FA#m           FA#m9   SI DO#m
 And ever owned you
                 SI/RE# MI6
Some sentimental tears   or someone else's girl
FA#m   
That drips away

      LAadd9         FA#m
But I somehow slowly love you
          DO#m           
And wanna keep you the same
MI      LAadd9         FA#m
Well, I somehow slowly know you
          DO#m         LAadd9   SIadd9  
And wanna keep you... away
