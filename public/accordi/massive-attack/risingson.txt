I seen you go down to a cold mirror

It was never clearer in my era so

You click a shine upon your forehead or

Check it by the signs in the corridor
                                 
You light my ways through the club maze
                                      
We would struggle through the dub daze
  SI5-
I sink myself in hair upon my lover

It's how you go down to men's room sink
SIbm
Sad we talk how madmen think

I sink myself in hair upon my lover

I don't know her from another miss

I don't know you from another
                                     
See me run now you're gone, dream on

Why you want to take me to this party and breathe

I'm dying to leave
                                            SI5-          
Every time we grind you know we sever lines
SIbm
 Where have those flowers gone
                
Long time passing
                                         SI5-
Why you keep it testing, keep on tasking
              
I keep on asking
SIbm
Toy-like people make me boy-like

Toy-like people make me boy-like
                           
They're invisible, when the trip it flips
                              
They get physical, way below my lips
                
And everything you got hoi-poloi like

Now you're lost and you're lethal
                                 
And now's about the time you gotta leave all
                            
These good people, dream on

Nicer than the bird up in the tree top

Cheaper than the chip inside my lap top

All the variations you could do with me

Nicer than the girl up in your mind you're free
FAm9
Automatic crystal remote control

We come to move your soul

You're gonna fade into the background

Like a better smoke'll bring you back round

Like a man slide inside you my dear

Your cheap beer's filled with crocodile tears
SIbm9
 See 'em run now you're gone, dream on

Toy-like people make me boy-like

Toy-like people make me boy-like

I found a reason
SIbm9
 I found a reason
      
Dream on

Dream on
            SOL5
Dream on
