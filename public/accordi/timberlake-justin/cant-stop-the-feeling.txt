           DO                LAm7
I got this feeling inside my bones
         FAadd9                        LAm7
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
           DO                   LAm7
And if you want it, inside your soul
                  FAadd9                   LAm7
Just open up your heart, let music take control
           DO
I got that sunshine in my pocket
         LAm7
Got that good soul in my feet
            FAadd9
I feel that hot blood in my body 
        LAm7
when it drops, ooh
        DO
I can't take my eyes up off it, 
       LAm7
moving so phenomenally
            FAadd9
The room on lock the way we rock it, 
         LAm7
so don't stop
          SIb/DO                 DO 
Under the lights when everything goes
           SIb/DO                    DO
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
        LAb/SIb                 SIb
When we move, well, you already know
         FAm7                        SOLm7/4
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine

DO
Nothing I can see but you 
         LAm7
when you dance, dance, dance
          FAadd9
A feeling good, good, creeping up on you
        LAm7
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
DO
All those things I shouldn't do
        LAm7
But you dance, dance, dance
     FAadd9                            LAm7
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

DO                       LAm7
 Ooh, it's something magical
            FAadd9
It's in the air, it's in my blood, 
             LAm7
it's rushing on
                DO                    LAm7
I don't need no reason, don't need control
         FAadd9                           LAm7
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone
                  DO
