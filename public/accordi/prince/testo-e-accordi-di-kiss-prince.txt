We couldn't turn around till we were upside down
                    FA               SOL      DO7+  SOL
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
             FA FAm                 DO7+   SOL
I couldn't be     there even when I try
                   FA7+                 DO7+
You don't believe it, we do this every time

                       SOL/SI       FA 
Seasons change and our love went cold
                                     DO7+
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
                    SOL/SI           FA7+
Run away, but we're running in circles

Run away, run away
  SOL         DO7+    SOL/SI
I dare you to do something
               FA7+                             DO7+
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
                    SOL/SI          FA7+
Run away, but we're running in circles

Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
  DO     SOL                           FA
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
                        DO7+        SOL/SI
You thought that it was special, special
                    FA7+                FAm
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
                     DO7+          SOL
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
                          FA7+                       DO7+
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
            FAm                      DO7+
It's only me, what you got to lose?
                            SOL/SI               FA7+
Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
                       DO7+
It's only me, let it go
