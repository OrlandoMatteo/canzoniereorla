FA#
 ...Dearly beloved

We are gathered here today
                                      FA#4 FA#
To get through this thing called life

Electric word life
           RE#m
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
                DO#6
But I'm here to tell you

There's something else

The afterworld
SI
 A world of never-ending happiness
               DO#7         DO#7/4 FA#
You can always see the sun, day or night

So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
                                       
You know the one Dr. Everything'll Be Alright
                                       DO#7/4 
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
                         FA#
Ask him how much of your mind, baby
          SI
'Cause in this life
                                   FA#
Things are much harder than in the afterworld
                
In this life
                   FA#    SI MI FA#
You're on your own...
           SI       MI       FA#
And if the elevator tries to bring you down
   FA#     SI      MI
Go crazy - punch a higher floor

FA# SI DO#m7    FA# SI DO#m7    

FA# SI DO#m7    FA# SI DO#m7

FA#          SI  DO#m7  FA#                 SI DO#m7
If you don't like   the world you're living in
FA#          SI       DO#m7   
Take a look around you
   FA#           SI      DO#m7  
At least you got friends
          FA#           SI   DO#m7  
You see I called my old lady
      FA#      SI    DO#m7   
For a friendly word
    FA#           SI   
She picked up the phone
DO#m7
Dropped it on the floor
 FA# SI      DO#m7   
"Uh  uh" was all I heard
DO#     
Are we gonna let the elevator
RE#m  SI DO#
Bring us down

Oh, no let's go!
FA#      SI    DO#m7
Let's go crazy
FA#       SI   DO#m7
Let's get nuts
      FA#          SI       DO#m7
Let's look for the purple banana
 SI       FA#    SI     DO#m7  SI
'Til they put us in the truck, let's go!

FA# SI DO#m7    FA# SI DO#m7

FA# SI DO#m7    FA# SI DO#m7 

FA#         SI    DO#m7  
We're all excited
       FA#        SI  DO#m7
But we don't know why
FA#         SI    DO#m7
Maybe it's 'cause
      FA#       SI   DO#m7
We're all gonna die
    FA#     SI          DO#m7
And when we do (when we do)
FA#           SI             DO#m7 
What's it all for (what's it all for)
    FA#         SI   
You better live now
  DO#m7                     FA#      SI      DO#m7
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door
         DO#                           RE#m  SI DO#
Tell me, are we gonna let the elevator bring us down

Oh, no let's go!

Let's go crazy
