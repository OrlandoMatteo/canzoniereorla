I was working part time in a five-and-dime,
   SOL                RE SOL LA
My boss was Mr. McGee
                   SOL           FA#m7
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind,
       SOL                    RE SOL LA
'Cause I was a bit 2 leisurely
                 SOL        FA#m7
Seems that I was busy doing something close 2 nothing,
    SOL                            RE SOL LA
But different than the day before
              SOL      FA#m7
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
           SOL
She walked in through the out door (out door)

           LA  SOL      RE/FA#
She wore a Raspberry beret
    SOL                RE   SOL  LA
The kind U find in a second hand store
    SOL      RE/FA#
Raspberry beret
    SOL                              RE   LA
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
    SOL      RE/FA#
Raspberry beret
          MI   LA
I think I love her

LA             SOL         FA#m7
Built like she was, uh, she had the nerve 2 ask me
     SOL                       RE SOL LA
If I planned 2 do her any harm
                                     
So, look here, 
                      SOL               FA#m7 
I put her on the back of my bike and-a we went riding
SOL                             RE SOL LA
Down by old man Johnson's farm
                     SOL        FA#m7
I said now, overcast days never turned me on
    SOL                                    RE SOL LA
But something about the clouds and her mixed
           SOL         FA#m7
She wasn't 2 bright but I could tell
                SOL
When she kissed me

She knew how 2 get her kicks

The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof,
RE
 And the horses wonder who U are
RE             LA/DO#                 RE   LA/DO#
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
  RE
U feel like a movie star
        SOL        FA#m           MI
Listen,  they say the first time ain't the greatest
           RE   
But I tell ya, if I had the chance 2 do it all again
  SOL                             FA#m
I wouldn't change a stroke 'cause baby I'm the most,

With a girl as fine as she was then
