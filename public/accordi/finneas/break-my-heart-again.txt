Hey, you
             RE7
I'm just now leaving
      SOL7+                     MIm9
Can I come around later on this evening?
  LAm7         RE7
Or do you need time?
        SOL7+           MIm9
Yes, of course, that's fine
     LAm7
Hey, you
     RE7
Good morning
                SOL7+
I'm sure you're busy now, 
                     MIm
why else would you ignore me?
  LAm7         RE7
Or do you need space?
          SOL7+                      MIm
You can't help it if your mind has changed
   LAm7                         RE7
So go ahead and break my heart again
         SOL7+                         MIm
Leave me wonderin' why the hell I ever let you in
    LAm7                    RE
Are you the definition of insanity?
      SOL7+
Or am I?
SIm            MIm
Oh, it must be nice
   RE       DO      RE                  MIm9
To love someone who lets you break them twice

          LAm7
You're so blue
              RE7
Are you still breathing?
          SOL7+                            MIm
Won't you tell me if you found that deeper meaning?
   LAm7                RE7
Do you think I've gone blind?
            SOL7+                              MIm
I know it's not the truth when you say, "I'm fine"
   LAm7                         RE
So go ahead and break my heart again
         SOL7+                         MIm

            LAm7                   RE7
So don't pretend that I'm the instigator
             SOL7+           SI7            MIm
You were the one, but you're born to say goodbye
          LAm7          RE7
Kissed me half a decade later
             SOL         SIm7     MIm
That same perfume, those same sad eyes
LAm                          RE7
Go ahead and break my heart again
         SOL                           MIm9
