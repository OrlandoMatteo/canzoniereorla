  REb            SOLb     LAb4        SOLb
I woke up it was seven, I waited 'til 11
        REb             SOLb         LAb4 SOLb
Just to figure out that no one would call
             REb          SOLb 
I think I've got a lot of friends
    LAb4              SOLb
But I don't hear from them
REb/FA         SOLb       LAb
What's another night all alone
            MIbm          SOLb        LAb
When you're spending everyday on your own

And here it goes

REb        SOLb
I'm just a kid
    LAb   
And life is a nightmare
REb        SOLb 
I'm just a kid
  LAb            SOLb
I know that it's not fair
MIbm   SOLb
Nobody cares
            REb
'Cause I'm alone 
        LAb      MIbm       SOLb         
and the world is having more fun 
     LAb  REb SOLb LAb4 SOLb
than me tonight
 
          REb               SOLb 
And maybe when the night is dead
     LAb4          SOLb
I'll crawl into my bed
    REb              SOLb        LAb4 SOLb              
I'm staring at these four walls again
            REb             SOLb 
I'll try to think about the last time 
LAb4     SOLb
 I had a good time
REb/FA         SOLb         LAb
Everyone's got somewhere to go
            MIbm           SOLb       LAb
And they're gonna leave me here on my own

And here it goes

REb        SOLb
I'm just a kid
    LAb   
And life is a nightmare
REb        SOLb

and the world is having more fun 
SOLb 
What the hell is wrong with me?
LAb         
Don't fit in with anybody
REb/FA              LAb SOLb    REb
How did this happen to  me?
SOLb
Wide awake, I'm bored 
      LAb         REb
and I can't fall asleep
    MIbm               LAb
And every night is the worst night ever
