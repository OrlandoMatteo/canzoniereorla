Do you ever feel like breaking down?
       SIbm
Do you ever feel out of place?
     SOLb
Like somehow you just don't belong
    LAb
And no one understands you
       REb
Do you ever want to run away?
       SIbm
Do you lock yourself in your room?
         SOLb
With the radio on turned up so loud
     LAb
That no one hears you screaming
       SOLb
No you don't know what its like
     SIbm7
When nothing feels alright
    SOLb                                LAb
You don't know what its like to be like me

   REb SIbm          SOLb
To be  hurt, to feel lost
      REb             LAb
To be left out in the dark
   REb SIbm               SOLb
To be  kicked when you're down
             REb                 LAb
To feel like you've been pushed around
   REb SIbm           SOLb
To be  on the edge of breaking down
    REb             LAb
And no one there to save you
       MIbm7                 REb/FA SOLb
No you don't know what its like
              REb
Welcome to my life

       REb
Do you want to be somebody else?
        SIbm
Are you sick of feeling so left out?
        SOLb
Are you desperate to find something more
  LAb
Before your life is over
        REb
Are you stuck inside a world you hate?
        SIbm
Are you sick of everyone around?
         SOLb
With the big fake smiles and stupid lies
    LAb
But deep inside you're bleeding
       SOLb
No you don't know what its like
     SIbm7
When nothing feels alright
    SOLb                                LAb
You don't know what its like to be like me
