       REm  SOLm  FA  LA

REm              SOLm         FA   LA
 Olhos verdes e boca cheia de vida
REm             SOLm              FA   LA      
 100 imagens refeitas sobre sua camisa
       REm                      SOLm7         
Não contei minha história eu perdi a memória
   FA6           LA4
De tudo o que passei
REm          SOLm7            FA6          LA                            
 Fuja logo comigo e confie no vento que se foi
        REm         SOLm7
And you keep coming home
        FA6             LA7/4
Cuz I'm running over my time
        REm                      SOLm7
And you see that you're not far away
  
But you clearly
FA6                LA
Don't make up your mind

           REm     SOLm7
So keep on moving on
        FA6         LA7/4
Keep on driving me home
            REm     SOLm7
And keep on moving on
        FA6         LA7/4
Keep on driving me home
         REm                   SOLm7
And I complain that you're not here
               FA6
But you cant't hide
                LA7/4
From moments of fear
               REm           SOLm7
And you're not there so I pretend
          FA6           LA
You're an image from my head
             REm   SOLm7
And you say (Oh-oh-oh)
             FA6   LA7/4
And you say (Oh-oh-oh)

REm              SOLm7            FA6   LA7/4
 Recolhendo os pedaços do vaso da vida
       REm               SOLm7              FA6     LA7/4
Não precisa gritar meu desejo é te amar sem ter fim
    REm         
Fotogramas de instantes
    SOLm7                FA6          LA7/4
Que foram importantes no mundo de nós dois
REm          SOLm7             FA6          LA7/4
 Fuja logo sozinho e confie no vento que se foi
