
MI
 Don't wanna live as an untold story

Rather go out in a blaze of glory
LA                        
I can't hear you, I don't fear you
MI
 I'll live now 'cause the bad die last

Dodging bullets with your broken past
LA                                 SI
I can't hear you, I don't fear you now
SOL#              DO#m
Wrapped in your regret
       RE                 LA           SI
What a waste of blood and sweat  Oh oh oh

              MI
I wanna taste love and pain
                      
Wanna feel pride and shame
              DO#m
I don't wanna take my time
            
Don't wanna waste one line
             FA#m7
I wanna live better days
             
Never look back and say
           LA
Could have been me
                   SI SI4 SI
It could have been me
    MI
Yeah

MI
 Don't wanna live as an unsung melody

I'd rather listen to the silence telling me
LA
I can't hear you, I won't fear you
MI
 Don't wanna wake up on a monday morning
                                     
The thought of work's getting my skin crawling
LA                                 SI
