
  MIb                                   FAm
I asked her to stay  But she wouldn't listen
    SIb                             MIb   SIb/RE
She left before I had the chance to say Oh
    DOm7                                         FAm7
The words that were mend  the things that were broken
    LAb              SIb             MIb
But now its far too late she's gone away
      MIb
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
         DOm7
Thinking why does this happen to me
         LAm7/5-                     LAbadd9
Why does every moment have to be so hard
SIb
  Hard to believe it

MIb
It's not over tonight
                      FAm7
Just give me one more chance to make it right
                  LAb
I may not make it through the night
  SIb              MIb
I won't go home without you

    DOm7                                FAm
The taste of her breath, I'll never get over
    SIb                           MIb     SIb/RE
The noises that she made kept me awake  Oh
    DOm7                                  FAm7
The weight of the things that remained unspoken
      LAb           SIb             MIb
Built up so much it crushed us everyday
      MIb
Every night you cry yourself to sleep
         DOm7
Thinking why does this happen to me
         LAm7/5-                     LAbadd9
Why does every moment have to be so hard
SIb
  Hard to believe it

MIb
It's not over tonight
                      FAm7
Just give me one more chance to make it right
                  LAb
I may not make it through the night
  SIb              MIb
I won't go home without you
MIb
It's not over tonight
                      FAm7
Just give me one more chance to make it right
                  LAb
I may not make it through the night
  SIb              MIb
I won't go home without you

REb         LAb                MIb          SIb
 Of all the things I felt I've never really showed
SOLb         REb             LAb          SIb          
 Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go, 

should not ever let you go oh oh oh

MIb
It's not over tonight
                      FAm7
Just give me one more chance to make it right
                  LAb
I may not make it through the night
  SIb              MIb
I won't go home without you

I won't go home without you
                  
I won't go home without you
                  DOm7
I won't go home without you
  LAb              MIb
I won't go home without you
