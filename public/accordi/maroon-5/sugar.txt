FA LAm SOL DO

FA  LAm   FA DO

FA LAm SOL DO

       FA                 LAm
She'll lie and steal, and cheat, 
    FA               DO
and beg you from her knees
FA                 LAm    SOL     DO
Make you think she means it this time
       FA             LAm      FA              DO
She'll tear a hole in you, the one you can't repair
    FA                LAm     SOL    DO
But I still love her, I don't really care

FA            DO     LAm     SOL       FA
 When we were young, oh, oh, we did enough
            DO    LAm       SOL        FA
When it got cold, ooh, ooh, we bundled up
           DO    LAm     SOL         DO
I can't be told, ah, ah, it can't be done

     FA         LAm       FA               DO
It's better to feel pain, than nothing at all
    FA          LAm      SOL  DO
The opposite of love's indifference
   FA            LAm
So pay attention now, 
    FA               DO
I'm standing on your porch screaming out
    FA              LAm     SOL      DO
And I won't leave until you come downstairs

             FA   DO            SOL LAm
So keep your head up, keep your lo--ve
SOL       FA   DO     SOL LAm
Keep your head up, my lo--ve 
          FA   DO  SOL LAm
Keep your head up, lo--ve
          FA   DO  SOL LAm
Keep your head up, lo--ve

    FA            LAm          FA  
And I don't blame you dear for running 
         DO
like you did all these years
FA             LAm         SOL    DO
I would do the same, you'd best believe
        FA                   LAm
And the highway signs say we're close 
    FA               DO
but I don't read those things anymore
  FA            LAm SOL DO
I never trusted my  own eyes

FA            DO     LAm     SOL       FA
 When we were young, oh, oh, we did enough
            DO    LAm       SOL        FA
When it got cold, ooh, ooh, we bundled up
           DO    LAm     SOL         DO
I can't be told, ah, ah, it can't be done
             FA   DO            SOL LAm
So keep your head up, keep your lo--ve
SOL       FA   DO     SOL LAm
Keep your head up, my lo--ve 
          FA   DO  SOL LAm
