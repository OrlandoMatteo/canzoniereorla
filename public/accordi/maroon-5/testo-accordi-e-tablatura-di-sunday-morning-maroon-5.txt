At  last 
SOLm7  DO7/9+        FA    REm7
    My love has come along
SOLm7   DOm7   DO7  FA       REm7
     My lonely days   are over
SOLm7   DO7            FA    FA7/MIb RE7/9- REb7
    And life is like a song
SOLm7/DO DO9
Oh yeah yeah

At last
SOLm7   DO7/9+         FA    REm7
   The skies above are blue
SOLm7   DOm7    DO7         FA       REm7
     My heart was wrapped up in clover
SOLm7        DO7       FA     SIb6/7  FA7+/9
   The night I looked at you

               SOLm7/4
I found a dream
DO7               FAadd9
   That I could speak to
FA6             MI7  FA7
   A dream that I
MI7        LAm7     DO6
   Can call my own
             REm7/4
I found a thrill 
SOL7           DO7+
   To press my cheek to
DO#dim           REm7/4  SOL7
   A thrill that I
           DO7
Have never known

Oh yeah yeah

    FA      REm7
You smiled, you smiled
SOLm7       DO7/9+       FA       REm7
   Oh and then the spell was cast
SOLm7     DOm7   DO7  FA         REm7
   And here we are    in heaven
SOLm7              DO9
   For you are mine...
