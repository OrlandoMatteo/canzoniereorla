Riding on the City of New Orleans
RE#m             SI             FA#
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
                 DO#              FA#
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
         RE#m        DO#7                 FA#
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail
     RE#m 
All along the southbound odyssey
    LA#m
The train pulls out at Kankakee
DO#                                SOL#
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields
RE#m                
Passin' trains that have no name
LA#m               
Freight yards full of old black men
        DO#               DO#7         FA#
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles

SI            DO#        FA#
Good morning America how are you?
     RE#m               SI              FA#
Say, don't you know me? I'm your native son
DO#7    FA#                 DO#       
I'm the train they call the City 
       RE#m FA#/DO# SOL#7/DO
of New Orleans 
        MI        SI/RE#  DO#
I'll be gone five hundred miles 
                FA#
when the day is done

        FA#
Dealin' card games 
         DO#            FA#
with the old men in the club car
RE#m                SI             FA#
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score
               DO#                FA#
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
RE#m            DO#                 FA#
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor
        RE#m
And the sons of pullman porters
        LA#m
And the sons of engineers
           DO#                            SOL#
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steel
RE#m
Mothers with their babes asleep
    LA#m
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
        DO#           DO#7              FA#
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel

SI            DO#        FA#
Good morning America how are you?

Nighttime on the City of New Orleans
RE#m             SI             FA#
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee
               DO#               FA#
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
            RE#m
Through the Mississippi darkness
DO#                 FA#
Rolling down to the sea
    RE#m
But all the towns and people seem
   LA#m
To fade into a bad dream
        DO#                              SOL#
And the steel rail still ain't heard the news
       RE#m
The conductor sings his songs again
    LA#m
The passengers will please refrain
     DO#                DO#7             FA#
This train got the disappearing railroad blues

SI          DO#        FA#
Good night America how are you?
