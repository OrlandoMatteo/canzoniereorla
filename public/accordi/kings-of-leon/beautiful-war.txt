
Intro:
LA

          LA
Bite your tongue
             
Don't make a scene dear
            RE
Everybody's been here
                
At least once before
                    LA
But we've been here more

Your heart breaks

Rolls down the window
             RE
I've seen it all go

Comeback around
               LA
I've heard the sound
                MI
The tip of your tongue
              RE
The top of your lungs
            LA
Is doing my head in

      LA
I say love
         
Don't mean nothing
         RE
Left them something
               
Worth fighting for
                 LA
It's a beautiful war
       
       LA
When I hold

The warmth of your body
           RE
There is nobody
         
That I'd rather hold
              LA
Shattered and cold
                MI
The tip of your tongue
              RE
The top of your lungs
             LA
Is making me crazy

      LA
I say love

Don't mean nothing
         RE
Left them something
              
Worth fighting for
                 LA
It's a beautiful war
   
I say love
 
You don't need nothing
         RE
Left them something
             
Worth fighting for
                 LA         FA#m7
It's a beautiful war
                 LA         FA#m7  RE
It's a beautiful war
                 LA
It's a beautiful war

      LA
I say love

I say love

Don't need nothing
         RE
Left them something,
    
Worth fighting for
      LA
I say love
           
Don't need nothing
         RE
Left them something

Worth fighting for
                 LA
It's a beautiful war

It's a beautiful war

It's a beautiful war

It's a beautiful war
