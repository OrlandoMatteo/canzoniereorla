MI

DO#m    MI    DO#m   

                  MI
Lay where you're laying

Don't make a sound
                DO#m
I know they're watching

They're watching
           MI
All the commotion

The kiddie-like play
               DO#m
It has people talking

Talking
  
MI
You
               DO#m  LA
Your sex is on fire

                MI
The dark of the alley

The breaking of day
                DO#m
Head while I'm driving

I'm driving
               MI
Soft lips are open

Them knuckles are pale
                   DO#m
Feels like you're dying
       LA7+
You're dying

MI
You
                 DO#m   LA
Your sex is on fire
   MI
Consumed
                      DO#m   LA
With what's just transpired

         MI
Hot as a fever

Rattle of bones
             DO#m
I could just taste it

Taste it
              MI
If this not forever

If this just tonight
                      DO#m
Oh we're still the greatest
     LA7+
The greatest  ...The greatest

MI
You
                DO#m   LA
Your sex is on fire
MI
You
                DO#m   
Your sex is on fire
   MI
Consumed
                      DO#m   LA
With what's just transpired
    MI
And you
                DO#m   LA
Your sex is on fire
    MI
Consumed
                      DO#m   LA   MI
With what's just transpired
