Been waiting on your call

When the phone rings

It's just some friends of mine that say
    LAm
"Hey, what's the matter man?

Singing after dark

          LAm
I've been stumbling on my feet
                             REm7
Shuffling through the street

People ask me, "What's the matter with you boy?"
