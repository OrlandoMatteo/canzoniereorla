She confessed her love to me

Then she vanished on the breeze

Trying to hold on to that was just impossible

She was more than beautiful

Closer to etherial

With a kind of down to earth flavor

 Close my eyes
     FA/LA              SOL6/LA
It's three in the afternoon
      LAm7  SOL6/LA
Then I realize
     FA/LA                 MIm
That she's really gone for good

Love has gone and made me blind
     MIm7/9                  MIm
I've looked but I just can't find
               DO   RE     MIm
She has gotten lost in the crowd

LAm
I was flippin' magazines

In that place on Mercer Street
                               FA LAm
When I thought I spotted her

Getting on a motor bike

Looking rather lady like
                                FA LAm
Didn't she just give me a wave?
LAm7     SOL6/LA
 Salty tears
     FA/LA              LAm7
It's three in the afternoon
              SOL6/LA          
Has she disappeared
   FA/LA               MIm
Is she really gone for good
