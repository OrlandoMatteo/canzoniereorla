RE
 I caught you knockin'
      DOadd9       SOL/SI
at my cellar door

I love you, baby,
      SOLm/SIb       DO
can I have some more
     FA              MI7/4 MI7  
Ooh, ooh, the damage done
RE
 I hit the city and
  DOadd9        SOL/SI
I lost my band

I watched the needle
      SOLm/SIb     DO
take another man
      FA               MI7/4  MI7
Gone, gone, the damage done

RE
 I sing the song
          DOadd9       SOL/SI
because I love the man
 
I know that some
          SOLm/SIb      DO
of you don't understand
     FA
Milk-blood
           MI7/4     MI7   RE
to keep from running out
    
I've seen the needle
        DOadd9       SOL/SI
and the damage done
                       SOLm/SIb  DO
A little part of it in everyone

But every junkie's
       FA          MI7/4  MI7
like a settin' sun
