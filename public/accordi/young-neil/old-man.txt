MIm7  RE  LAm7/4  

        MIm7
He came dancing across the water
         RE
With his galleons and guns
LAm7/4
 Looking for the new world

In that palace in the sun
       MIm7
On the shore lay Montezuma
       RE
With his coca leaves and pearls
       LAm7/4
In his halls he often wondered

With the secrets of the worlds

        MIm7
And his subjects

Gathered 'round him
         RE
Like the leaves around a tree
         LAm7/4
In their clothes of many colors

For the angry gods to see
        MIm7
And the women all were beautiful
        RE
And the men stood
                     LAm7/4
Straight and strong

They offered life in sacrifice

So that others could go on

MIm7  RE  LAm7/4

MIm7
Hate was just a legend
    RE
And war was never known
LAm7/4
 The people worked together

And they lifted many stones
     MIm7
They carried them

To the flatlands
         RE
And they died along the way
         LAm7/4
But they built up

With their bare hands

What we still can't do today
      MIm7
And I know she's living there
        RE                   LAm7/4
And she loves me to this day

I still can't remember when

Or how I lost my way

MIm7  RE  LAm7/4

        MIm7
He came dancing across the water
RE
   Cortez, Cortez
LAm7/4              
   What a killer

MIm7  RE  LAm7/4
