These days my waves get lost in the ocean
SIb                  
Seven billion swimmers

man I'm going through the motions
FA
Sent up a flare, I need love and devotion
SIb
Traded for some faces that I never know, notion
FA
Maybe I should try to find the old me
               SIb
Take me to the places
                 REm
and the people that know me
                  FA
Trying to just connect

thinking maybe you could show me
              SIb
If there's so many people here
      REm
then why am I so lonely?

FA
Can I get a connection?
    SIb                REm
Can I get, can I get a connection?
FA

     FA
Real friends, good friends

hard to find, let's face it
SIb
Buy the perfect home
       REm
and there's a flood in the basement
FA
Made a couple dollars now

and I ain't tryna chase it
SIb                 REm
Kids from Oklahoma, man we don't waste it
FA
I'm just tryna paint the picture for me
                SIb                 RE
Something I can give a damn about at maybe 40
                  FA
Years and I'll be ready and willing

and able to edit the story
                 SIb 
Cause there's so many people here

to be so damn lonely

FA
Can I get a connection?

Foot to the floor
 REm

FA
Need somebody else, sometimes ain't no shame
