 Woke up in London yesterday
                                   RE#m
Found myself in the city, near Picadilly
                        DO#
Don't really know how I got here
                           FA#
I got some pictures on my phone
                                   SI
New names and numbers that I don't know
                             RE#m
Address to places like Abbey Road

Day turns to night
                   DO#
Night turns to whatever we want

We're young enough to say

FA#                        SI
Oh, this has gotta be the good life
                       RE#m
This has gotta be the good life
                        DO#
This could really be a good life, good life
      FA#                           SI
I say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
                     RE#m
Like this city is on fire tonight
                       DO#
This could really be a good life
    
A good, good life
FA#   SI   RE#m   DO#

 To my friends in New York, I say hello
                               RE#m
My friends in L.A. they don't know
                                          DO#
Where I've been for the past few years or so
                        FA#
Paris to China to Colorado
                                         SI
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
                                           RE#m
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
                                        DO#
We all got our stories but please, tell me
                            FA#
What there's to complain about
                           SI
When you're happy like a fool
                 RE#m
Let it take you over
                    DO#
When everything is out

You gotta take it in

FA#                        SI
Oh, this has gotta be the good life

Oh...             Oh, good, good life
FA#   SI   RE#m   DO#
Oh...

      FA#
Hopelessly I feel like there might 

be something that I'll miss

Hopelessly I feel like the window 

closes oh so quick

Hopelessly I'm taking a mental 

picture of you now

'Cause hopelessly the hope is 

we have so much to feel good about

FA#                        SI
