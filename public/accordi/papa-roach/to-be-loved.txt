     RE
When I was a boy

I didn't care about a thing
       SOL
It was me and this world

And a broken dream
      MIm7
I was blaming myself
    LA
For all that was going
RE
wrong (going wrong)
      
I was way out there

On the wrong side of town
        SOL
And the one's that I loved

I started pushing them out
       MIm7
Then I realized
     LA            RE
That it was all my fault

                        RE
I've been looking for a lifeline
         LA           SOL
For what seems like a lifetime
                    MIm7
I'm drowning in the pain
              LA
Breaking down again
              RE
Looking for a lifeline

     RE
So I put out my hand

And I asked for some help
   SOL
We tore down the walls

I built around myself
      MIm7
I was struck by the light
    LA            RE
And I fell to the ground

                        RE
I've been looking for a lifeline
         LA           SOL
For what seems like a lifetime
                    MIm7
I'm drowning in the pain
              LA
Breaking down again
              RE
Looking for a lifeline
                 RE
Is there anybody out there

Can you pull me from this
SOL
ocean of despair
                    MIm
I'm drowning in the pain
              LA
Breaking down again
              RE
Looking for a lifeline

           SIm
You know a heart of gold
      LA               SOL
Won't take you all the way
         SIm
And in a world so cold
     LA               SOL
It's hard to keep the faith
                       RE   SOL   MIm7 LA RE
I'm never gonna fade away
