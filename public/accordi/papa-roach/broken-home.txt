 I can't seem to fight these feelings

I'm caught in the middle of this

And my wounds are not healing

I'm stuck in between my parents

I wish I had someone to talk to

Someone I could confide in

I just want to know the truth
 
I just want to know the truth

Want to   know the truth

             Broken home

...All alone

FA#m
 I know my mother loves me

But does my father even care

If I'm sad or angry

You were never ever there

When I needed you

I hope you regret what you did

I think I know the truth

Your father did the same to you
RE5 DO#5 SI5  LA5 FA#5       RE5 DO#5 SI5 LA5
Did the  same to  you

 I'm crying day and night now
SI5     LA5        FA#5
What is wrong with me?
                RE5 DO#5
I cannot fight now
  SI5       LA5    FA#5
I feel like a weak link
                     RE5 DO#5
Crying day and night now

I feel like a weak link

(Push it back inside...)

  MI   FA#m     MI FA#m    MI FA#m
A weak link

Broken home

All alone

It feels bad to be alone

Crying by yourself, living in a broken home

How could I tell it

So all y'all could feel it

Depression strikes hard

Just like my old earth would tell it

To me, her son

She told me I'm the one

Pain bottled up, about to blow like a gun

Stories that I tell are nonfiction

And you can't take it back 

'cause it's already done
