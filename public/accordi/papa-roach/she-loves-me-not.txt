
LAm
 When I see her eyes
FA
 Look into my eyes
RE5
 Then I realize
     MI5
That she could see inside my head
LAm
 So I close my eyes
FA
 Thinking that I could hide
RE5
 Disassociate
   MI5             DO
So I don't have to lose my head
LAm       FA
 This situation
               RE5
Leads to agitation

Will she cut me off?
MI5
Will this be an amputation?
LAm        FA
  I don't know
      RE5
If I care
       MI5
I'm a jerk
            FA
Life's not fair
                 SOL
Fighting all the time
               LAm
This is out of line

She loves me not
         FA
Loves me not
          SOL
Do you realize
              LAm
I won't compromise

She loves me not
         FA  SOL  LAm
Loves me not


Over the past five years
FA
 I have shed my tears
RE5
 I have drank my beers
    MI5
And watched my fears

Fly away
LAm
 And until this day
FA
 She still swings my way
RE5
 But it's sad to say
    MI5                DO
Sometimes she says she loves me not
LAm
 But I hesitate
FA
 To tell her I hate
RE5
 This relationship
  MI5
I want out today
              LAm
This is over
         FA

        MI5
Relationship is getting ill

Piss drunk stupid
LAm
Mad on the real
                      FA
Could you feel what I feel
                 
What's the deal girl
              RE5
We're tearing up each other's world

We should be in harmony
MI5            DO
Boy and girl
                    LAm
That is the promise we made

Back in the day
   FA
We told each other things wouldn't be this way
RE5
 I think we should work this out
     MI5
It's alright baby we can scream and shout

LAm
 I don't know
