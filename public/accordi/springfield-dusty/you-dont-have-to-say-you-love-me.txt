SOLm    SOLm/FA MIm7/5-   LA  SOLm7  REm

            SOLm         DO
When I said I needed you
                   FA          SIb
You said you would always stay
           SIb/LA SOLm           SOLm/FA     
It wasn't me who  changed but you
MIm7/5-              LA7    REm
 and now you've gone away
                   SOLm            DO
Don't you see that now you've gone
                  FA        SIb
And I'm left here on my own
          SIb/LA SOLm       SOLm/FA
That I have to   follow you 
MIm7/5-             LA7    LA7/5+
and beg you to come home

But believe me I'll never tie you down


REm                  SOLm      DO
 Left alone with just a memory
               FA              SIb   
Life seems dead and quite unreal
             SIb/LA SOLm       SOLm/FA
All that's left  is loneliness 
LA7                     REm
 there's nothing left to feel
