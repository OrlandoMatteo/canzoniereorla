In the cool of the evening, 
     RE7/6                         LAm7    RE7/6
when everything is getting kind of groovy,
    LAm7                           
You call me up, and ask me would 
  RE7/6                         LAm7   RE7/6
I like to go with you and see a movie,
LAm7
First I say no, I've got some plans for tonight,
           RE7/6         MIbdim 
And then I stop,  ...and say al - right,           
LAm7                       RE7/6                  LAm7  MI7/5+
Love is kinda crazy with a spooky little boy like you!
                                                         
    LAm7                        
You always keep me guessing, 
  RE7/6                           LAm7      RE7/6
I never seem to know what you are thinking,
         LAm7
And if a girl looks you,
         RE7/6                            LAm7      RE7/6
It's for sure your little eye will be a - winking,
LAm7
I get confused, I never know where I stand,
             RE7/6         MIbdim 
And then you smile  ...and hold my hand,
LAm7                        
Love is kinda crazy with 
  RE7/6                  LAm7  MI7/9+
a spooky little boy like you,  spoo - ky,  ...hey!

LAm7                        
If you decide, someday, 
   RE7/6                              LAm7      RE7/6
to stop this little game that you are playing,
    LAm7                              
I'm gonna tell you all the things 
   RE7/6                       LAm7    RE7/6
my heart's been a -dying to be saying,
LAm7
Just like a ghost, you've been a- haunting my dreams,
          RE7/6           MIbdim 
But now I know  ...you're not what you seem,         
LAm7                        
Love is kinda crazy with 
  RE7/6                  LAm7        MI7/9+
a spooky little boy like you, spoo - ky,  ...hey!

LAm7      RE7/6           LAm7    RE7/6               
      Ah, hah - hah, ah!  Spooky, mm - mm, humm!   
LAm7     RE7/6
Spooky,  ...ah, ah, ah!
LAm7     RE7/6               
Spooky,    ...hoo- oo!   
LAm7    RE7/6            LAm7     MI7    LAm9
Spooky, ...eh, eh - eh!  Spooky!
