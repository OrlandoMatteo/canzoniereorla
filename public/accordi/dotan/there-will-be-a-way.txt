
          FAm
I want my heart paper thin
           LAb
Felt these walls crumbling
                       MIb
Always questioning the high
                 REb
Never felt quite right
             FAm
I’m reaching out like a satellite
         LAb
I lost myself into the night
                       MIb
Chasing sorry with goodbye
                   REb
Why do good things die?
SIbm                     
Running from all of the thoughts in my head
    REb
I’m fighting my way to the end

FAm              
Underneath the cold, underneath the rain
                LAb
There will be a way, there will be a way
                   
There will be a way
MIb
Just another storm, just another flame
                 REb
That will be the day, that will be the day

That will be the day
     FAm                                      LAb
Like all, ’cause all I want is hear is let me go
     
Meet me on the other side
MIb     
Underneath the cold, underneath the rain
                REb
There will be a way
                  
There will be a way

          FAm
My demons trapped inside my mind
        LAb
Growing wild in their demise
                        MIb
Always dancing with the end
                 REb
Like a long lost friend
           FAm                      
Holding my breath till my lungs burn bright
          LAb
Finding myself in the light
                       MIb
Feeling comfort in the pain
                REb
Like I’m alive again

FAm 
Underneath the cold, underneath the rain
                LAb
There will be a way, there will be a way
                  
There will be a way
MIb                            
Just another storm, just another flame
                 REb
That will be the day, that will be the day

That will be the day
     FAm                                      LAb
Like all, ’cause all I want is hear is let me go
                       
Meet me on the other side
MIb                   
Underneath the cold, underneath the rain
                REb
There will be a way
                  
There will be a way
             FAm
Ooh-ooh-ooh
                   MIb             SIbm
There will be a way   Ooh-ooh-ooh...

REb
Running from all of the thoughts in my head
    FAm
I’m fighting my way to the end
                MIb            REb
‘Cause I can forget I’m alive again

FAm
Underneath the cold, underneath the rain
                LAb
There will be a way, there will be a way

There will be a way
MIb                 
Just another storm, just another flame
                 REb
That will be the day, that will be the day

That will be the day
     FAm                                      LAb
Like all, ’cause all I want is hear is let me go
              
Meet me on the other side
MIb                 
Underneath the cold, underneath the rain
                REb
There will be a way
                  
There will be a way

FAm
There will be a way (There will be a way)
LAb
There will be a way (There will be a way)
        
There will be a way
MIb 
Underneath the cold, underneath the rain 

(There will be a way)
                REb
There will be a way

(There will, there will be a way)
