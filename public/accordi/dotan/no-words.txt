
SIm          LA4
Sunlight creeps in
              SOL
Cracks in the door
           
I'll step outside
                          SIm                   
When the world's sleeping
            LA4
My head held low
          SOL
Out of control

Words hurt the most
                        SIm
When there's no meaning
                    LA
And the wolves outside
                  SOL7+
They come at my door
          
Cold like the snow
                      SIm
As they breathe on me
                     LA
And the lies they write
                    SOL7+
Made me start the fall
                
I'm holding so tight
                    SOL 
But my hands let go
   SIm
No words
  LA
Silence
MIm                     SOL
I just let the music speak
   SIm
Frozen
   LA
Quiet
MIm                   SOL
Broken by the big machine
                           SIm
It's like you've lost your faith in me
LA                    MIm            SOL
 When all the bullets start to bleed
   SIm
No words
  LA    MIm                       SIm
Silence I just let the music speak

          LA4
Sand on my feet
                SOL
As far as I can be
       
It all feels so bleak
                             SIm
Cause the winds still whisper
                 LA
But why can't you see
            SOL
Lines run so deep
            
Gave me the key
                 FA#7  SIm   
To the dark underneath
                  LA
And the wolves outside
                  SOL7+
They come at my door
               
Cold like the snow
                      SIm
As they breathe on me
                    LA
And the lies they write
                  SOL7+
Made me start the fall

I'm holding so tight
                    SOL

I just let the music speak

Frozen

It's like you've lost your faith in me

I just let the music speak

SIm                LA

No words

Silence
MIm
I just let the music speak
