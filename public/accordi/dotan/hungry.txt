Hit up the bottle
SOLm               FA
Hearts will melt like ice
   DOm               SIb
As lights keep falling
          SOLm           FA
Makes you feel so small again
      DOm          SIb
As we walk in circles
  SOLm              FA 
A blind leading the blind
   DOm          SIb
No way of hiding
  SOLm         FA
A heart is all we've got

DOm                 SIb
 I'm hungry for you my love

 Out in this war of needs

DOm              SIb
Drag your heart up
       SOLm           FA
To the place where it belongs
           DOm      SIb
While it's under water
         SOLm           FA
Where my love will fill your lungs
 DOm            SIb
Clouds are shaking
         SOLm        FA
And your palms began to crack
DOm                  SIb
Hands against your eyes
         SOLm        FA
See this love is all we've got

 Out in this war of needs

It's a hive of honeybees
                      FA
Trapped inside of our skin
        MIb
Growing faster

Stinging harder
                  FA
Till we all give in
