
DO#m                             LA
 I've been lost inside a million eyes
           MI                                   SI   SOL#7
They don't see me, they don't know what it's like
DO#m                            LA
 Trading colours into black and white
         MI                                SI   SOL#7
No one's reading all the words to the right
LA                                     DO#m
Oh, feel the weight of the world in my bones
                             SOL#
Try to swim but I'm sinking alone
          
Always falling in the deep unknown

                         DO#m
Now I'm fighting with my hands up, hands up
                           LA
Feel the bullets from your hand rush, hand rush
                    MI
I can see your body in touch, in touch
              SOL#
'Cause I feel numb
                      DO#m
So infected with your bad blood, bad blood
                        LA
Keep on running till it blows up, blows up
                      MI
All I wanted was your real love
           SOL#
But I feel numb

DO#m                        LA
 Silent voices to a distant crowd
          MI                              SI   SOL#7
I'm still singing but there's no one around
DO#m                                LA
 I keep screaming till by lungs run out
           MI                              SI   SOL#7
But no one listens, no more words coming out
LA                                     DO#m
Oh, feel the weight of the world in my bones
                             SOL#
Try to swim but I'm sinking alone

Always falling in the deep unknown

Now I'm fighting with my hands up, hands up
                           LA
Feel the bullets from your hand rush, hand rush
                    MI
I can see your body in touch, in touch
              SOL#
'Cause I feel numb
