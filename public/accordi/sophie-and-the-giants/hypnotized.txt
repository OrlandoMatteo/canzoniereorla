Feel buried alive, this city is airtight
RE                          LA
 Suffocatin', lonely in the crowds

I'm surrounded by all the screens of their lies
RE                                 LA
Screamin' into space to drown them out

So hold me tight, I just wanna fade out

Somewhere we can shut the world away

I'm ready to hide far from the fallouts
