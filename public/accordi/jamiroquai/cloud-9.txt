LAm7         SOL/LA SIb/LA          SIm7  
 You pick me up,    then you put me down
LAm7           SOL/LA       SIb/LA  SIm7
 Can't seem to find my way around ya
LAm7          SOL/LA      SIb/LA             SIm7
 See what you think, when you don't think it now
LAm7         SOL/LA           SIb/LA  SIm7
 You lost my love but someone found it
LAm7          SOL/LA SIb/LA        SIm7
 Now when the rain   falls upon my head
LAm7              SOL/LA           SIb/LA  SIm7
 I don't think of you that much at all
LAm7      SOL/LA SIb/LA           SIm7
 Just one thing  seemed to make you care
LAm7         SOL/LA             SIb/LA  SIm7
 Who's gonna drive and take you home?

LA SOL/LA REm7             FA          SOL  LA
 Only a   fool could walk away from me this time
       SOL/LA REm7          FA         SOL LA
I look up to  heaven, every star I see is mine
  SOL/LA REm7              FA          SOL  LA
Only a   fool could walk away from me this time
       SOL/LA  REm7           FA          SOL  
I'm walking on air, and every cloud is cloud 9

LAm7        SOL/LA  SIb/LA         SIm7
 You get your kicks playing stupid tricks
LAm7            SOL/LA       SIb/LA
 But I've found another crush
SIm7   
 You got me now
LAm7          SOL/LA       SIb/LA        SIm7
Game, set and match, don't seem to be no catch
LAm7                 SOL/LA          SIb/LA  SIm7
 I don't think she'll drive me to the wall
LAm7         SOL/LA
We go out at night, 
        SIb/LA        SIm7
and the world starts feeling right
LAm7       SOL/LA     SIb/LA SIm7
 She don't care about Hollywood
  LAm7             SOL/LA
I know you don't believe it, 
         SIb/LA         SIm7
but this time I really mean it
LAm7         SOL/LA    SIb/LA   SIm7
 I hope it's clearly understood

Can't change it, baby
