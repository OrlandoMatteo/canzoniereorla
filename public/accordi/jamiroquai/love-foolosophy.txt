SIm7              MIm7                DO7+/9   SIm7
Ooh, baby baby, I feel these sweet sensations, yeah
                    MIm7        DO7+/9  SIm7
Honey, honey, looks like a superstar,    yeah yeah
                      MIm7             DO7+/9  SIm7
She' got a promise of love-struck fascination,  ooh
                      MIm7               
What am I to do? How am I to know 
        DO7+/9  SIm7
who you are?

          SIm7  FA#m7   DO#m7
When this love, fool----osophy is killing
MIm7                           SIm7
Previous illusions that (I'm a love fool)
  FA#m7                DO#m7      MIm7
I had in my mind about you (I'm a love fool)
SIm7     FA#m7 DO#m7    
Seems so true, all the lies you're telling
MIm7                             SIm7
Tragically compelling and (I'm a love fool)
   FA#m7                     DO#m7
My love, it means nothing to you
   MIm7                   SIm7
So maybe I'm still a love fool

MIm7                      DO7+/9 SIm7
She shimmers like a California   sunset
           MIm7                    DO7+/9  SIm7
Lady lady, glitters but there's no gold
                      MIm7           DO7+/9  SIm7
She carries sweetly infectious magic formulas
                 MIm7                  DO7+/9
I'm so delirious, is she that serious?
                                    SIm7
Or is she bringing me on, I've been waiting so long
