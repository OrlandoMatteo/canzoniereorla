REm                                         MIb7+
 Little darlin' don't you see the sun is shining
         SIb6/9      LA7   REm
Just for you, only today
                                  MIb7+
If you hurry you can get a ray on you, 
          SIb6/9      LA7   REm
come with me, just to play
                                   MIb7+
Like every humming bird and bumblebee
                                  SIb6/9
Every sunflower, cloud and every tree
                           LA7
I feel so much a part of this
REm                                  MIb7+
 Nature's got me high and it's beautiful
              SIb6/9
I'm with this deep eternal universe
     LA7
From death until rebirth

SIb7+         SOLm7               FA7+       LA7 
 This corner of the earth is like me in many ways
SIb7+          SOLm7
 I can sit for hours here 
              FA7+             LA7
and watch the emerald feathers play
SIb7+            SOLm7
 On the face of it I'm blessed
         FA7+               LA7
When the sunlight comes for free
SIb7+        SOLm7         FA7+                LA7
 I know this corner of the earth, it smiles at me

REm
 So inspired of that 
                              MIb7+
there's nothing left to do or say
        SIb6/9             LA7
Think I'll dream, 'til the stars shine
REm
 The wind it whispers 
                             MIb7+
and the clouds don't seem to care
      SIb6/9                 LA7
And I know inside, that it's all mine
REm                               MIb7+
 It's the chorus of the breakin' dawn
                                       SIb6/9
The mist that comes before the sun is born
                 LA7
To a hazy afternoon in May
REm
 Nature's got me high 
                  MIb7+
and it's so beautiful, yeah yeah
              SIb6/9 
I'm with this deep eternal universe 
     LA7
