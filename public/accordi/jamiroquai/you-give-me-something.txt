RE  SIm7/9  SOL7+  SIm7/9

       RE7+                  SIm7/9
When I met you, you were so unique
    SOL7+                          SIm7/9
You had a little thing I'd love to keep
          RE7+                     SIm7
And every movement carried much mystique
  SOL7+   
I knew right then I'd carry on
   SIm7/9
To you I knew my heart belonged

        RE7+             SIm7/9
So know you, you give me something
SOL7+                          SIm7
Something that nobody else can give
       RE7+          SIm7/9
And my heart started thumpin'
             SOL7+                          SIm7/9
You know now you're the one I truly know I dig

         RE7+                    SIm7/9
Like the sunbeams from a perfect summer day
SOL7+                     SIm7/9
Heaven only seems a step away
         RE7+               SIm7/9
When I'm with you I just celebrate
    SOL7+
I'm hoping my message gets through
SIm7/9
There's never been someone like you
RE7+    SIm7
I had nobody
    SOL7+      SIm7/9
But on you I'd lean
       RE7+          SIm7
'Cause you got these little things
      SOL7+               SIm7/9
That I, I know I've never seen

             RE7+             SIm7/9
You know now you, you give me something
SOL7+                           SIm7/9
Something that nobody else has got
         RE7+                 SIm7/9
And this love, that I've been wanting
             SOL7+                          SIm7/9
Oh baby it's turning out to be too fast to stop
             RE7+              SIm7/9
You know now ooh, you give me something
SOL7+                          SIm7/9
Something that nobody else can give
       RE7+              SIm7/9
See my heart has started thumpin'
              SOL7+                         SIm7/9
You know babe you're the one I truly know I dig
