FA#m   DO#m   SOL#m   RE#m


     FA#m  RE  SOL#m  SIm
Am I love?
               FA#m   RE  SOL#m  SIm
Every heart is beating
      FA#m   RE  SOL#m  SIm
I'm all love
                  FA#m    RE  SOL#m  SI
Can't you feel me feeling?
        FA#m  RE  SOL#m  SI
Take my hand
            FA#m  RE  SOL#m  SIm
Cold like a junkie
SIm             FA#m  RE  SOL#m  SIm
I'm an ice cold man
 SIm            FA#m  RE  SOL#m  SIm
(I'm an ice cold)


                    FA#m
Why am I crying for you?
                MI
All this love I felt for you
SOL#m                     RE#m
 Has gone away to another place
FA#m                 MI 
 I put my faith in a digital world

Where they've given me
SOL#m           SI
 Eyes without a face
FA#m                    MI
 I stare at the moon on silver nights
SOL#m                   RE#m
 Remind myself I am someone
FA#m                 MI
 My soul is null and void tonight


           FA#m  RE  SOL#m  SIm   
(I'm Automaton)

FA#m  RE  SOL#m  SIm

       FA#m  RE  SOL#m  SIm
I'm so tough
                 FA#m   RE  SOL#m  SIm
Can't you see me running
          FA#m  RE  SOL#m  SIm
See I can touch
                FA#m   RE  SOL#m  SIm
Can you feel me coming?
          FA#m  RE  SOL#m  SIm
I see the world
            FA#m    RE  SOL#m  SIm
And cry for freedom
            FA#m               RE 
These metal eyes, they can't disguise
              SOL#m
The fact that I
        SIm            FA#m     RE  SOL#m 
(I need something to believe in)
                SIm         FA#m
But they're not crying for you


                      MI
I said goodbye to the world I knew
SOL#m                     RE#m
 And took off into inner space 
                  FA#m
(It's a digital life)
                         MI
Weren't you the ones who promised me
SOL#m             SI
 A very different place
FA#m                MI
 I power up, get my program set
SOL#m                         RE#m
 And turn my head towards the sun
FA#m                MI
 Inside I know, I'm null and void

Hey, you got me down underground
SI                     SOL#m
Gettin' holed up in my cyber lounge
                    FAm7/5-         SI
As if I had time to break that down
     SOL#m    
(Automaton)
                          FAm7/5-
Whatever you can do I can override it
      SI              SOL#m
Got a million ways to synthesize it

Digital android, I can fight it

FA#m                  MI
 Feel like a man, who fell to Earth
SOL#m                       RE#m
 But this is not where I belong
FA#m                      MI       
 They rule my life from a metal box, 
       
that's windowless
      SOL#m                     SI
And I wonder, where it all goes wrong
FA#m                   MI
 Maybe this dream will stay alive
SOL#m                     RE#m
 But can the madness be undone?
FA#m            MI
 Am I the new intelligence?
           FA#m   MI   SOL#m   RE#m
(I'm Automaton)...
           FA#m   MI   SOL#m   SI
(I'm Automaton)...

                FA#m
You know I need something
        MI
I can hold onto
 SOL#m
Hold onto
               RE#m
You were all I knew

(I'm Automaton)
       FA#m
I need something
         MI
I can hold onto
   SOL#m
Hold onto
               RE#m
This was all I knew
           FA#m   MI   SOL#m   RE#m
(I'm Automaton)...
