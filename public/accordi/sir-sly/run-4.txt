REm            SOLm
 You could be another face 
     FA       LA              REm
that I forget soon as I move along
          SOLm
Everybody makes mistakes
     FA               LA          REm
Am I mistaken for the way I carry on?
                 SOLm
You could show a little grace, 
    FA                LA             REm
but maybe things just went a bit too far
   SOLm            FA
We are just who we are
   LA                             
No time for "what if"s and "what if not"s

REm          DO      SIb
Heavy as the setting sun
        FA
Oh, I'm counting all the numbers
        LA
between zero and one
REm          DO     SIb
Happy, but a little lost
        FA       
Well, I don't know what I don't know
        LA                     REm  SOLm  FA6
So I'll kick my shoes off and run (yeah)
        LA            REm  SOLm  FA6
Kick my shoes off and run
        LA            REm  
Kick my shoes off and run 
    SOLm               FA6
(run, we'll be running barefoot)
        LA            REm  SOLm  FA6
Kick my shoes off and run
        LA        
Kick my shoes off and

REm             SOLm
 You could be a happy bride 
    FA                LA            REm
and we could still be blissfully in love
                 SOLm   FA
Instead of being 25 and already feeling 
     LA            REm
like you have had enough
                SOLm
You could be my one regret, 
FA         LA           REm
infinitely spiraling me down
    SOLm                FA     LA
Sometimes the world feels loud

REm          DO      SIb
