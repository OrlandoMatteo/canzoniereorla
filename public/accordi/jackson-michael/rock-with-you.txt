             SOL#m7
You'll never make me stay
             MIadd9          FA#add9
So take your weight off of me
            SOL#m7
I know your every move
             MIadd9         FA#add9
So won't you just let me be
               SOL#m7
I've been here times before
          MIadd9          FA#add9
But I was too blind to see
           SOL#m7
That you seduce every man
              MIadd9         FA#add9            
This time you won't seduce me
               SOL#m7
She's saying, "That's okay
           MIadd9            FA#add9
Hey, baby, do what you please
           SOL#m7
I have the stuff that you want
         MIadd9             FA#add9
I am the thing that you need
              SOL#m7
She looked me deep in the eyes
             MIadd9         FA#add9
She touchin' me so to start
                 RE#7
She says there's no turnin' back"

              SOL#m
She likes the boys in the bands
               MIadd9           FA#add9
She knows when they come to town
        SOL#m7           
Every musician's fan, 
          MIadd9            FA#add9
after the curtain comes down
             SOL#m7
She waits at backstage doors, 
              MIadd9      FA#add9
for those who have prestige
            SOL#m7
Who promise fortune and fame, 
              MIadd9    FA#add9
a life that's so carefree
               SOL#m7
She's saying, "That's okay
           MIadd9          FA#add9 
Hey, baby, do what you want
             SOL#m7
I'll be your night lovin' thing
            MIadd9           FA#add9
I'll be the freak you can taunt
        SOL#m7    
I don't care what you say
        MIadd9    FA#add9
I wanna go too far
             RE#7

She said, "I have to go home
                MIadd9       FA#add9
'Cause I'm real tired you see
           SOL#m7
Now I hate sleepin' alone
              MIadd9       FA#add9
Why don't you come with me?"
            SOL#m7
I said, "My baby's at home
               MIadd9        FA#add9
She's probably worried tonight
         SOL#m7
I didn't call on the phone
            MIadd9     FA#add9
To say that I'm alright"
      SOL#m7
Diana walked up to me
               MIadd9        FA#add9
She said, "I'm all yours tonight"
           SOL#m7
And then I ran to the phone
           MIadd9      FA#add9
Sayin', "Baby I'm alright"
             SOL#m7
I said, "But unlock the door"
         MIadd9        FA#add9
'Cause I forgot the key
                RE#7
