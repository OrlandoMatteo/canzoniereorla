Another day has gone, I'm still all alone,
               DO#m7                    MI6/FA#
how could this be, you're not here with me
                   SI          FA#/LA#  SOL#m7
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why,
                DO#m7                     MI6/FA#
did you have to go, and leave my world so cold?

     LA6           SOL#7           MI
Everyday I sit and ask myself  How did love slip away 
DO#m7                            FA#7/4
Something whispers in my ear and says that...

             SI             FA#/LA#   SOL#m7
You are not alone, for I am here with you
                  DO#m7              FA#7/4
though you're far away, I am here to stay
                 SI             FA#/LA#   SOL#m7
But you are not alone, for I am here with you,
                  DO#m7                     FA#7/4
though we're far apart, you're always in my heart,

but you are not alone

Just the other night I thought I heard you cry,
             DO#m7                    FA#7/4
asking me to come, and hold you in my arms
                SI                    FA#/LA#  SOL#m7
I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear,
                       DO#m7                   FA#7/4
but first I need your hand, then forever can begin

 Whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
             LA/SOL            FA#7/4
And girl you know that I'll be there
        SOL7/4
I'll be there
