  "There must be some way out of here,"
DOm          SIb        LAb    SIb
  said the joker to the thief,
DOm                 SIb       LAb  SIb
  "There's too much confusion,
DOm       SIb      LAb   SIb
  I can't get no relief.
DOm            SIb  LAb         SIb
  Businessmen, they drink my wine,
DOm       SIb          LAb  SIb
  plowmen dig my earth,
DOm       SIb  LAb            SIb
  None of them along the line
DOm         SIb          LAb    SIb
  know what any of it is worth."

  "No reason to get excited,"
DOm             SIb          LAb  SIb
  the thief, he kindly spoke,
DOm            SIb      LAb     SIb
  "There are many here among us
DOm             SIb           LAb  SIb
  who feel that life is but a joke.
DOm           SIb      LAb             SIb
  But you and I, we've been through that,
DOm           SIb     LAb  SIb
  and this is not our fate,
DOm         SIb      LAb         SIb
  So let us not talk falsely now,
DOm           SIb            LAb   SIb
  the hour is getting late."

All along the watchtower,
DOm       SIb           LAb  SIb
  princes kept the view
DOm             SIb   LAb           SIb
  While all the women came and went,
DOm        SIb        LAb  SIb
  barefoot servants, too.
DOm     SIb         LAb      SIb
Outside in the cold distance
DOm     SIb     LAb    SIb
  a wildcat did growl,
DOm          SIb           LAb  SIb
  Two riders were approaching,
        DOm    SIb        LAb  SIb
And the wind began to howl.
