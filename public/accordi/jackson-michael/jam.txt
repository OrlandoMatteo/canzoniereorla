REm7
Nation to nation, 
        REm6+
all the world must come together,
         REm7
Face the problems that we see,
           REm6+    
Then maybe somehow we can work it out
REm7                       REm6+
 I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said, later
         REm7
What has come of all the people, 
        REm6+
have we lost love of what it's about?
REm
 I have to find my peace 

cause no one seems to let me be

False prophets cry of doom, 

what are the possibilities?
REm7                           REm6+
 I told my brother there'll be problems, 

times and tears for fears,
    REm7                                REm6+                             
But we must live each day like it's the last

Go with it, go with it

REm7 SOL                          
Jam   It ain't, it ain't too much stuff,
REm7                  SOL                      REm7
It ain't too much, it ain't too much for me to jam
         SOL                     REm7

REm7 
 The world keeps changing, 
       REm6+
rearranging minds and thoughts,
            REm7
Predictions fly of doom, 
                  REm6+
the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
REm7
 I told my brother, 
          REm6+
don't you ask me for no favors,
       REm7
I'm conditioned by the system, 
          REm6+                     
don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
REm           
 She pray to God to Buddha, 

then she sings a Talmud song

Confusions contradict the self, 

do we know right from wrong?
REm7                    REm6+                       
 I just want you to recognize me, I'm the temple,
          REm7     
You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself

Go with it, go with it

REm
Jam, jam, here comes the man, hot damn,

The big boy stands, movin' up a hand

Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson,

Smooth criminal, that's the man, Mike's so relaxed

Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle, 

bum rushed to door 3 and 4's in a bundle

Execute the plan, first I cooled like a fan,

Got with Janet, then with Guy, 

now with Michael 'cause it ain't hard to
