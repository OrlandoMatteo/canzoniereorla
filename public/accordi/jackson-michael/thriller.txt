DO#m7  FA#7  SOL#dim

DO#m  MI    FA#  DO#m

DO#m7            FA#7 

It's close to midnight
    DO#m7                                 FA#7
and something evil's, lurking in the dark

Under the moonlight
    DO#m7
you see a sight, that almost stops your heart
           FA#7
You try to scream
                                       DO#m7
but terror takes the sound, before you make it
             FA#7
You start to freeze
                                      DO#m7
as horror looks you right between the eyes
LA/DO#        DO#m7/9
You're para-lyzed

             DO#m   MI        FA# DO#m
'Cos this is Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night
      FA#7
There ain't no second chance
            FA#m7
to kill the thing with forty eyes, girl
DO#m    MI        FA# DO#m
 Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night
       FA#7
You're fighting for your life
         LA7      FA#7          DO#m7
inside a  killer,  Thriller, to-night

             DO#m7
You hear the door slam
                                        FA#7
and realise there's nowhere left to run
             DO#m7
You feel the cold hand

and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
               FA#7
You close your eyes
                                 DO#m7
and hope that this is just imagi-nation
            FA#7
But all the while
                                     LA/DO#
you hear the creature creepin' up be-hind
              DO#m7/9
You're out of time

             DO#m   MI        FA# DO#m
'Cos this is Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night
      FA#7
There ain't no second chance
            FA#m7
to kill the thing with forty eyes, girl
DO#m    MI        FA# DO#m
 Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night
       FA#7
You're fighting for your life
         LA7      FA#7          DO#m7
inside a  killer,  Thriller, to-night

FA#7
Night creatures call and the dead start to walk
         LA7+       SI
in their masquerade
DO#m7
There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien
      LA#m7/5-
this time
LA7+                     SOL#7/4  SOL#7
 This is the end of your life

FA#7            DO#m7
 They're out to get you
                                       FA#7
there's demons closing in on every side
              DO#m7
They will pos-sess you

unless you change the number on your dial
           FA#7
Now is the time
                                 DO#m7
for you and I to cuddle close to-gether
                FA#7
All through the night
                                     DO#m7
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
LA/DO#        DO#m7/4
I'll make you see...

             DO#m   MI        FA# DO#m
That this is Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night
       FA#7
'Cause I can thrill you more
         FA#m7
than any ghost would ever dare try
DO#m    MI       FA# DO#m
Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night
   FA#7
So let me hold you tight
            LA7      FA#7
and share a  killer,  Thriller,
FA#7     LA/SI    DO#m7             MI
 Diller,  chiller, Thriller here to-night.

             DO#m   MI        FA# DO#m
That this is Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night
       FA#7
'Cause I can thrill you more

DO#m    MI       FA# DO#m
Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night
   FA#7
So let me hold you tight
            LA7      FA#7

                           DO#m7
 ...I'm gonna thrill you tonight

(Parlato)
DO#m      LA/DO#
 Darkness falls across the land
SI/DO#                FA#/DO#
 the midnight hour is close at hand.
DO#m                LA/DO#
 Creatures crawl in search of blood
SI/DO#             FA#/DO#
 to terrorise your neighbourhood.
DO#m                    LA/DO#
 And whosoever shall be found
            SI/DO#           FA#/DO#
without the soul for getting down
               DO#m               LA/DO#
Must stand and face the Hounds of Hell
     SI/DO#               FA#/DO#
and rot inside a corpse's shell.

(Cantato) 
                           DO#m
 ...I'm gonna thrill you tonight
LA/DO#                       SI/DO#  FA#/DO#
Uh... I'm gonna thrill you tonight..  oh darling
                           DO#m
 ...I'm gonna thrill you tonight
LA/DO#                       SI/DO#  FA#/DO#
Uh... I'm gonna thrill you tonight..  oh darling
             DO#m     LA/DO#
 ...Thrill tonight... uh

(Parlato) 
            SI/DO#
The foulest stench is in the air
    FA#/DO#                DO#m
the funk of forty thousand years,
           LA/DO#
And grizzy ghouls from every tomb
SI/DO#             FA#/DO#
 are closing in to seal your doom.
DO#m                  LA/DO#
 And though you fight to stay alive
SI/DO#              FA#/DO#
your body starts to shiver,
    DO#m           LA/DO#
For no mere mortal can resist
     SI/DO#      FA#/DO#
the evil of The Thriller

Hahahahaha...
