FA#m
  She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
                                                  SIm
I said don`t mind but what do you mean,I am the one
                                      FA#m
Who will dance on the floor in the round
                   SIm
She said I am the one
                                        FA#m
Who will dance on the floor in the round?  

She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene

Then ev`ry head turned with eyes that dreamed
               SIm
Of being the one,
                                      FA#m
Who will dance on the floor in the round

RE                        FA#m
People always told me, be careful what you do
          RE                             FA#m
And don`t go around breaking young girls' hearts
    RE                        FA#m
And mother always told me, be careful who you love,
       RE                              DO#7
And be careful what you do, `cause the lie becomes the truth, hey

FA#m
  Billie Jean is not my lover,
                                            SIm
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
                       FA#m
But the kid is not my son
                   SIm
She says I am the one,
                       FA#m
But the kid is not my son               

FA#m
 For forty days and forty nights, law was on her side
                                   
But who can stand when she`s in demand,
                 SIm
Her scemes and plans
                                      FA#m
`Cause we danced on the floor in the round
                   SIm                                        
So take my strong advice: 
                              FA#m
Just remember to always think twice
                                                    
She told my baby we danced till three, and she looked at me,
                             
Then showed a photo My baby cried
                   SIm
His eyes were like mine
                                 FA#m
Can we dance on the floor in the round?
RE                        FA#m
People always told me, be careful what you do
          RE                               FA#m
And don`t go around breaking young girls' hearts
        RE                                 FA#m
But you came and stood right by me, just a smell of sweet perfume
     RE                         DO#7
This happened much too soon She called me to her room, hey
