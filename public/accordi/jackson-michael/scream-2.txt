 Tired of injustice

Tired of the schemes

Lies are disgusted

So what does it mean

Kicking me down

I got to get up

As jacked as it sounds

The whole system sucks, damnit

Peek in the shadow

Come into the light

You tell me I'm wrong

Then you better prove you're right

You're sellin' out souls but

I care about mine

I've got to get stronger

And I won't give up the fight

 Tired of you tellin' the story your way
