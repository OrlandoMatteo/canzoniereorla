I know you've deceived me

I know that you have

 If you think that I don't know

About the little tricks you play
MI                        SOL

you put things in my way

 You took advantage of my trust in you when 
         MI       SOL LA
I was so far away
MI
 I saw you holding lots of other guys

And now you've got the nerve to say
         LA
That you still want me
      SI
Well, that's as may be
        LA
But you gotta stand trial
