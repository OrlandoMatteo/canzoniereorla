REm9             DO                  SIb
 I think you can do much better than me
      REm9              DO           SIb
After all the lies that I made you believe
REm9         DO                SIb
 Guilt kicks in and I start to see
    REm9 
The edge of the bed
           DO                SIb
Where your nightgown used to be
REm       SIb          DO 
 I told myself I won't miss you
              REm
But I remember
        SIb          DO       SIb LA7/4 REm
What it feels like beside you
                   SIb             REm
I really miss your hair in my face
                 DO                REm
And the way your innocence tastes
      SIb              DO
And I think you should know this
                             REm9  DO  SIb
You deserve much better than me

REm9  DO  SIb

REm            DO                      SIb
 While looking through your old box of notes
              REm
I found those pictures I took
     DO               SIb    REm
That you were looking for
               DO                     SIb
If there's one memory I don't want to lose
     REm
That time at the mall
        DO                 SIb
You and me in the dressing room
REm       SIb          DO
 I told myself I won't miss you
              REm
But I remember
        SIb          DO        SIb LA7/4 REm
What it feels like beside you

                   SIb            REm
I really miss your hair in my face
                 DO              REm
And the way your innocence tastes
      SIb              DO
And I think you should know this
                             SOLm7
You deserve much better than me
                                SIb
The bed I'm lying in is getting colder
                                FA
Wish I never would've said it's over
               DO       SOLm7
And I can't pretend... 
                                 SIb
I won't think about you when I'm older
                              FA
Cause we never really had our closure
                  DO    LA7/DO#
This can't be the end
