MIm                 DO/MI
 You set my soul at ease
                       MIm6+
Chased darkness out of view
                               DO/MI
Left your desperate spell on me

Say you feel it too
             MIm
I know you do
                          DO/MI
I've got so much more to give
                           MIm6+
This can't die, I yearn to live
                  DO/MI
Pour yourself all over me
                                       SOL
And I'll cherish every drop here on my knees
        RE          MIm
I wanna love you forever
    DO                        SOL
And this is all I'm asking of you
             RE          MIm
Ten thousand lifetimes together
   DO                         SOL
Is that so much for you to do?
                              RE
'Cause from the moment that I saw your face
MIm                        DO
 And felt the fire in your sweet embrace
          SOL

MIm                      DO/MI
 My mind fails to understand
                      MIm6+
What my heart tells me to do
                      DO/MI
And I'd give up all I have just to be with you
            MIm
And now I do
                          DO/MI
I've always been taught to win
                        MIm6+
And I never thought I'd fall
                        DO/MI
Be at the mercy of a man

I've never been
                                  SOL
