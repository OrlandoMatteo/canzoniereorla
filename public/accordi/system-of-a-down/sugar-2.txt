DO5
The kombucha mushroom people

Sitting around all day

Who could believe you?

Who could believe you?

Let your mother pray

Sugar!

I'm not there all the time, you know

Some people, some people, some people

Call it insane!

Yeah, they call it insane! (Sugar!)

I play Russian roulette every day, a man's sport

With a bullet called life

Yeah mama, called life! (Sugar!)

You know that every time I try to go

Where I really want to be

It's already where I am

'Cause I'm already there!

 I got a gun the other day from Sako

It's cute, small, fits right in my pocket

Yeah, right in my pocket! (Sugar!)

My girl, you know, she lashes out at me sometimes

And I just fucking kick her in the

Ooh baby, she's okay (Sugar!)

People are always chasing me down

Trying to push my face to the ground

Where all they really want to do

Is suck out my motherfucking brains!

Sugar!

REb5    REb5 DO5
 I sit...      in my desolate room...
REb5       REb5 DO5       REb5
 No lights!      No music!  Just anger!
REb5 DO5
       I killed everyone
REb5 REb5 DO5
 I'm      ...gone away forever
REb5
But I'm feeling better!

How do I feel, what do I say

Fuck you, it all goes away

How do I feel, what do I say

Fuck you, it all goes away

How do I feel, what do I say

In the end it all goes away

How do I feel, what do I say

In the end it all goes away

How do I feel, what do I say

In the end it all goes away

How do I feel, what do I say

In the end it all goes away
DO5
How do I feel, what do I say
