
DOm
 The piercing radiant moon 

The storming of poor June 

All the life running through her hair 

Approaching guiding light 

Our shallow years in fright 

Dreams are made, winding 
                SIb
Through my head 
                DOm
Through my he---ad
  SIb      LAb SOL DOm
Before you know,  awake

DOm
 Your lives are open wide

The V-chip gives them sight

Of all the life running through her hair

The spiders all in tune

The evening of the moon

Dreams are made, winding
                 SIb
Through my head
                 DOm
Through my he----ad
  SIb      LAb SOL DOm   REb MI
Before you know,  awake

DOm   REb MI DOm   REb MI

DOm   REb MI

           SIb
Through my head
                 DOm
Through my he----ad
  SIb      LAb  SOL  DOm
Before you know
  SIb      LAb            SOL           DOm
Before you know I will be waiting, all awake

Dreams are made winding through her hair

Dreams are made winding through her hair
