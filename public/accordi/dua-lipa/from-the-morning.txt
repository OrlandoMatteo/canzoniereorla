  A day once dawned and it was beautiful
DO        FA                 SOL7/4   DO
  A day once dawned from the ground
                 FA    DO               FA
Then the night she fell and the air was beautiful
DO             FA         SOL7/4   DO
 The night she fell all around
           FA          DO
So look, see the days
          FA               DO
The endless coloured ways
         FA                   SOL7/4 
And go play the game that you learned
         DO       FA  DO  FA  DO
From the morning
       FA      DO          FA
And now we rise and we are everywhere
DO       FA               SOL7/4   DO
 And now we rise from the ground
        FA       DO           FA   
And see she flies, and she is everywhere
DO        FA         SOL7/4   DO
  See she flies all around
           FA            DO
So look, see the sights
           FA             DO
The endless summer nights
      FA                      SOL7/4
And go play the game that you learned
         DO      FA  DO  FA
From the morning
