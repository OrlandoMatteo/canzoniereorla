Shook a thousand hands 
    SOLm             MIb
and seen my share of smiles
     SIb
I've caused some great concern 
         MIb          FA
and told one too many lies
    SIb                               FA
And now I see the world through these sad, 

old, jaded eyes

   SIb
So what if I threw a party 
    MIb  
and all my friends were there?

       SIb
With a backup band of bass players 
   MIb
to keep us up all night
