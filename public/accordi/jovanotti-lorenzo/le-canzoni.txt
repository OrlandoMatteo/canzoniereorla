       MIm    
It's a cruel, cruel world to face on your own
  RE                        
A heavy cross to carry along
    MIm
The lights are on but everyone's gone
          RE
And it's cruel
       MIm
It's a funny way to make ends meet
         RE
When the lights are out on every street
   MIm            
It feels alright but never complete
REb
 Without joy


          MIm
I checked you, if it's already been done
     REm
Undo it
         MIm
It takes two, it's up to me and you
    REm
To prove it
        MIm
On the rainy nights even the coldest days
       REm
You're moments ago but seconds away
    MIm
The principle of nature, it's true but
       REm
It's a cruel world...


MIm      RE   DO5 SI5
Uh...
MIm      RE   DO5 SI5
Uh...

       MIm
We can play it safe or play it cool
RE
Follow the leader or make up all the rules
   MIm
Whatever you want, the choice is yours
RE
 So choose


          MIm
I checked you if it's already been done

To prove it...

I trust you, it's already been done
