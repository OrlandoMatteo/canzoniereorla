I was under your spell for such a long time 
         MIb
couldn't break the chains
REb                               FAm
 You played with my heart tore me apart 
              MIb
with all your lies and games
REb
 It took all the strength I had 
    FAm                MIb
but I crawled up on my feet again
REb
 Now you're trying to lure me back 
    FAm               MIb
but no those days are gone my friend
REb                         FAm
 I loved you so much then I thought someday 
     MIb
that you could change
REb                           FAm
 But all you brought me was a heart full of pain

    FAm              MIb

REb                      FAm
 You took my money and I knew that you, 
          MIb
you could kill someone
REb                        FAm          MIb    
 I gave you everything but nothing was ever enough
REb                           FAm  
 You were always jealous over such crazy stuff

I jumped off a train running off the tracks

Love is gone, face the facts
   REb                    FAm
