Auf wiedersehen
             LA
It's time to say goodbye

The party's over
       FA#m
As the laughter dies
   SOL#
An angel cries
  DO#m
Humanity
                         LA
It's au revoir to your insanity
                                FA#m
You sold your soul to feed your vanity
     SOL#          DO#m
Your fantasies and lies

         DO#m
You're a drop in the rain

Just a number not a name
              FA#m
And you don't see it

You don't believe it
       DO#m
At the end of the day

You're a needle in the hay
               FA#m
You signed and sealed it

And now you gotta deal with it
  LA   SI
Humanity
  LA   SI

Goodbye

    DO#m
Be on your way
                      LA
Adios amigo there's a price to pay
                      FA#m         
For all the egotistic games you played
    SOL#
The world you made
   DO#m
Is gone

         DO#m
You're a drop in the rain

Just a number not a name
              FA#m
And you don't see it

You don't believe it
       DO#m
At the end of the day

You're a needle in the hay
               FA#m
You signed and sealed it

And now you gotta deal with it
  LA   SI
Humanity
  LA   SI

Goodbye

DO#m                            FA#m
In your eyes I'm staring at the end of time
             SI
Nothing can change us
           SOL#/DO          LA
No one can save us from ourselves

DO#m    LA    FA#m  SOL#  DO#m

         DO#m
You're a drop in the rain

Just a number not a name
              FA#m
And you don't see it

You don't believe it
       DO#m
At the end of the day

You're a needle in the hay
               FA#m
You signed and sealed it

And now you gotta deal with it
  LA   SI
Humanity

Goodbye    ...Goodbye
