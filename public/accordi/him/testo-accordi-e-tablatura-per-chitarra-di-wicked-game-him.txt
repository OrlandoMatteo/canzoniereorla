SIm      LA
 I was a highwayman
          SOL               SIm
Along the coach roads I did ride
LA              SOL    RE    LA
 With sword and pistol by my side
MIm     SIm                 LA            SOL7+
 Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
MIm     SIm              LA              SOL7+
 Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
SIm           LA             SOL       LA     RE
 The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
    SOL         LA
But I am still alive

SIm      LA
 I was a sailor
      SOL           SIm      LA
I was born upon the tide
             SOL   RE   LA     MIm
And with the sea I did abide
           SIm                LA          SOL7+
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
MIm      SIm                 LA            SOL7+       
 I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
SIm           LA                   SOL
 And when the yards broke off they said 
     LA    RE
that I got killed
    SOL         LA
But I am living still

SIm      LA
 I was a dam builder
           SOL            SIm
Across the river deep and wide
LA               SOL   RE    LA
 Where steel and water did collide
MIm             SIm            LA       SOL7+
 A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
MIm            SIm           LA             SOL7+     
 I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
SIm          LA               SOL
 They buried me in that great tomb 
     LA      RE
that knows no sound
    SOL         LA
But I am still around
                RE          FA#m/DO#   SIm
I'll always be around, and around and around 
     LA         SOL   FA#m   MIm      SOL LA RE
and around and around...

SIm         LA
 I'll fly a starship
           SOL        SIm     LA
Across the Universe divide
           SOL       RE    LA
And when I reach the other side
MIm          SIm              LA          SOL7+
 I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
MIm        SIm          LA          SOL7+
 Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
SIm       LA          SOL    LA      RE
 Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
    SOL      LA
But I will remain
                  RE         FA#m/DO#  SIm
And I'll be back again, and again and again 
     LA        SOL   FA#m   MIm       SOL LA RE
and again and again...
