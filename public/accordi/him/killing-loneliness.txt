DOm             SOLm
 Memories sharp as daggers
FAm                        LAb
Pierce into the flesh of today
DOm                            SOLm
 Suicide of love took away all that matters
    FAm
And buried the remains 
      LAb            SIb     DOm
in an unmarked grave in your heart

                  MIb
With the venomous kiss you gave me
    LAb                               
I'm killing loneliness (Killing loneliness)
DOm                      MIb              LAb
 With the warmth of your arms, you saved me
                              MIb  SIb
Oh, I'm killing loneliness with yo----u
    DOm
The killing loneliness
     LAb                   MIb  SIb  DOm

DOm                SOLm
 Nailed to a cross together 
   FAm                 LAb
as solitude begs us to stay
DOm                      SOLm
 We disappear in the lie forever
      FAm                                LAb
And denounce the power of death over our souls
                     SIb             DOm
And secret words are said to start a war

                  MIb
With the venomous kiss you gave me
    LAb
