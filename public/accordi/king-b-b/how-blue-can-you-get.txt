 I've been downhearted baby
RE7                        RE9
 Ever since the day we met
SOL7                               
 I said I've been downhearted baby
RE7
 Ever since the day we met
LA7                          SOL7               
 Our love is nothing but the blues, woman
RE7                     LA7
 Baby, how blue can you get?
RE7                           SOL7   
 You're evil when I'm with you
RE7                                  RE9
 And you are jealous when we're apart
SOL7
 Yes, I said you're evil
                                    
You're so evil when I'm with you, baby
RE7
 And you are jealous when we're apart
LA7                          SOL7
 How blue can you get, baby?
     RE7                         LA7
The answer's is right here in my heart

RE7 
 I gave you a brand-new Ford

You said I want a Cadillac
 
I bought you a ten dollar dinner

You said thanks for the snack

I let you live in my penthouse

You said it was just a shack

I gave you seven children

And now you want to give them back
          SOL7
Yes, I've been downhearted baby
                   RE7
Ever since the day we met
           LA7                          SOL7
I said our love is nothing but the blues
          RE7               LA7         
Baby, how blue can you get?
 RE7
Get!
