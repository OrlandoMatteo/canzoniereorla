MIb                               LAb7
The sound that you're listening to is from my guitar
       MIb7                                  LAb7
That's named Lucille  I'm very crazy about Lucille
                                            MIb
Lucille took me from the plantation  Oh you might say,
                    SIb7
Brought me fame
                           LAb7                       MIb
I don't think I could just talk enough about Lucille

Sometime when I'm blue seem like Lucille try to help
                  SIb7   MIb
Me call my name
                                               LAb7
I used to sing spirituals and I thought that this was
                            MIb   MIb7
The thing that I wanted to do 
             
But somehow or other
     LAb7                                     MIb
When I went in the army I picked up on Lucille, and
                        SIb7
Started singing blues
     LAb7                         MIb 
Well, now when I'm paying my dues, maybe you don't
                                             
Know what I mean when I say paying dues, I mean when
                     SIb7   MIb
Things are bad with me 
            LAb7 
I can always, I can always,
                      MIb         MIb7  LAb7
You know like, depend on Lucille
                                       
Sort of hard to talk to you myself I guess I'll let
              MIb                   SIb7    LAb7    MIb
Lucille say a few words and then
                                            SIb7   MIb7
You know, I doubt if you can feel it like I do 

But
                                        LAb7
When I think about the things that I've gone through,
                        MIb7
Like, well for instance, if I have a girlfriend and
               LAb7                            
She misuses me, and I go home at night, maybe I'm
                             MIb                       SIb7
Lonely, well not maybe, I am lonely, I pick up Lucille
     
And it bring out those funny sounds that sound good to
         LAb7     MIb
Me, you know 
          LAb7      
Sometime I get to the place where I
           MIb           SIb7    MIb
Can't even say nothing
          LAb7   MIb   
Look out
                             LAb7   
Sometime I think it's crying
              
MIb    SIb7  LAb7  MIb LAb MIb SIb7

MIb   LAb7   MIb

                                        LAb7  
You know, if I could sing pop tunes like Frank Sinatra
                                     MIb7
Or Sammy Davis Junior, I don't think I still could do
                                                     SIb7
It, 'cause Lucille don't wanna play nothing but the Blues 
            LAb7                               MIb
I think I'm, I think I'm pretty glad about That 
                                           SIb7
Cause don't nobody sing to me like Lucille
MIb             LAb7   MIb   LAb7   MIb
  Sing, Lucille
                                                  SIb7
Well, I'll put it like this Take it easy, Lucille 
                                                
I Like the way Sammy sings and I like the way Frank
  LAb7                                     MIb
Sings, but I can get a little Frank, Sammy, a little
                                                      SIb7

                                       LAb7
You wanna know why I call the guitar Lucille
  MIb
Lucille Has practically saved my life two or three times 
                        LAb7
No Kidding, it really has
                                               MIb
I remember once I was in an automobile accident, and
                                   
When the car stopped turning over, it fell over on
       SIb7                  
Lucille, and it held it up off me, really, it held it
         LAb7   MIb
Up off me 
              LAb                  MIb   
So that's one time it saved my life
    SIb7        MIb                            LAb7
The way, the way I came by the name of Lucille, I was
                                            MIb
Over in Twist, Arkansas, I know you've never heard of
                                 LAb7
That one, have you? And one night the guys started a

Ball over there, you know, they started brawling, you
                MIb                
Know what I mean   And the guy that was mad with his
        SIb7
Old lady, when she fell over on this gas tank that was
            LAb7                           MIb   LAb7  MIb  
Burning for heat, the gas ran all over the floor

SIb7    MIb  

                                  LAb7        MIb
And when the gas ran all over the floor, the building

Caught on fire, and almost burned me up trying to save
         LAb7
Lucille Oh I, I imagine you're still wondering why I
                                             MIb
Call it Lucille, the lady that started that brawl that
                         SIb7   LAb7   
Night was named Lucille
                             MIb         LAb  MIb
And that's been Lucille ever since to me 
                     SIb7    MIb  LAb7  MIb  MIb7
One more Now, Lucille

LAb7    MIb    SIb7

Sounds pretty good to me Can I do one more?

MIb      SIb7  MIb7  LAb7  MIb7
