 Just hear me out
FAadd9    
 If it's not perfect, 
                                  SOL5
I'll perfect it till my heart explodes
         SIbadd9  FAadd9
I highly doubt
                             
That I can make it through 
                         SOL5
another one of your episodes
        SIbadd9  FAadd9
Lashing out
                           
One of the petty moves you pull 
                     MIbadd9
before you lose control
     FA      SOL
You wear me out
MIbadd9   FA        RE5
 But it's all right now

'Cause the sex is so much better 
                  
when you're mad at me

 Oh, the breakup's worth 
                               SOL5
the makeup sex you're giving me
              SIbadd9
Let's hash it out
FAadd9
'Cause your bitching 

and your yelling don't mean anything
SOL5            SIbadd9   FAadd9
