  As far as I can see
                      MIbm
it's too much freedom for me
                   LAb
That's the way you like it. Ah-ah
REb                    SIbm
  If she's so happy to be
                  MIbm
It's never enough for me
                     LAb
And that's the way I like it. Ah-ah ah-ah
REb               SIbm
  You taste humility
              MIbm
Without a referee
                    LAb
That's the way they like it. Ah-ah ah-ah
REb             SIbm
  And no commodities
               MIbm
Not even a cup of tea
                    LAb
That's the way they like it, oooh

REb               SOLb
  Keep on feeling better
LAb                 REb
Love be pleased and stay
               SOLb
Really doesn't matter
             REb
Wake me up today
         SOLb  LAb
Da da da da...

REb               SIbm
  The particles I breathe
                   MIbm
The remedy I never need
                   LAb
That's the way you like it. Ah-ah
REb                 SIbm
  The scent of modesty
                     SIbm
The judge that walks in peace
                    LAb
That's the way they like it, oooh

REb               SOLb

  Not even when I run on pride
LA                             LAb
  I'll change and rearrange my kind
REb                      SIbm
