 Something has to change

Un-deniable dilemma

Boredom's not a burden

Anyone should bear

Constant over stimulation numbs me

But I wouldn't want you

It any other way

    FA5       MIb5 FA5
It's not enough
            MIb5 FA5
I need more
              MIb5 FA5     MIb5 FA5
Nothing seems to   satisfy
               MIb5 FA5
I don't want it
               MIb5 FA5
I just need it
          MIb5 FA5
To breathe, to feel, 
            MIb5 FA5  REb5  MIb5
to know I'm a----live
FA5    REb5            MIb5
Finger deep within the borderline
FA5              REb5
Show me that you love me 
         MIb5
and that we belong together
FA5  REb5    MIb5              FA5
Relax, turn around and take my hand

FAm
 I can help you change

Tired moments into pleasure

Say the word and we'll be

Well upon our way

Blend and balance

Pain and comfort

Deep within you

Till you will not want me any other way

    FA5       MIb5 FA5
It's not enough
            MIb5 FA5
I need more
              MIb5 FA5     MIb5 FA5
Nothing seems to   satisfy
               MIb5 FA5
I don't want it
               MIb5 FA5
I just need it
          MIb5 FA5
To breathe, to feel, 
            MIb5 FA5  REb5  MIb5
to know I'm a----live
FA5     REb5            MIb5
Knuckle deep inside the borderline
FA5             REb5  
This may hurt a little 
         MIb5
but it's something you'll get used to
FA5  REb5   MIb5
Relax Slip away

Something kinda sad about
    FA5
The way that things have come to be
  REb5          MIb5
Desensitized to everything
DO5   FA5
 What became of subtlety?

REbadd9  MIbadd9  DO5 SIbadd9

                             REbadd9  MIbadd9  DO5
How can it mean anything to me
SIbadd9                      
 If I really don't feel anything 
       REbadd9  MIbadd9  DO5
at all?

FA5                     LAb5  SIb5  SOL5
 I'll keep digging till
FA5              LAb5  SIb5  SOL5
I feel something

FA5   REb5            MIb5
Elbow deep within the borderline
FA5              REb5
Show me that you love me 
         MIb5
and that we belong together
FA5  REb5    MIb5              FA5
Relax, turn around and take my hand
