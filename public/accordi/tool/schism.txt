REm
I know the pieces fit

'Cause I watched them fall away

Mildewed and smouldering,

Fundamental differing

Pure intention juxtaposed

Will set two lovers' souls in motion

Disintegrating as it goes

Testing our communication

The light that feuled our fire then

Has a burned a hole between us so

We cannot see to reach an end
                        LAadd9  LAm
Crippling our communication

REm
I know the pieces fit

'Cause I watched them tumble down

No fault, none to blame

It doesn't mean I don't desire to

Point the finger, blame the other

Watch the temple topple over

To bring the pieces back together
                      LAadd9  LAm
Rediscover communication

RE5   FA5 SOL5
 The poetry
      RE5             FA5     SOL5     RE5
That comes from the squaring off between
         FA5      SOL5
And the circling is worth it
RE5          FA5 SOL5          REm    SOL5       
 Finding beauty in the dissonance

REm
 There was a time that the pieces fit

But I watched them fall away

Mildewed and smouldering,

Strangled by our coveting

I've done the math enough to know

The dangers of our second guessing

Doomed to crumble unless we grow
                             LAadd9  LAm
And strengthen our communication


             FA7+
Cold silence has
REm9     LAm
A tendency to
        FA7+   SOL
Atrophy any
REm9        LAm
Sense of compassion
                 FA7+ DO SOL LAm
Between supposed brothers,
                 FA7+ DO SOL RE5              
Between supposed lovers
