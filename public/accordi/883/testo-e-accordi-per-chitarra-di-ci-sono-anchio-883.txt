Dashing through the snow
                    SOLm7
On a one-horse open sleigh,
                   DO7
Over the fields we go,
                 FA
Laughing all the way

Bells on bob-tail ring,
               SOLm7
Making spirits bright,
                   DO7
What fun it is to ride and sing
                   FA     DO7
A sleighing song tonight

FA
Jingle bells, jingle bells,

Jingle all the way!
SIb           FA
O what fun it is to ride
     SOL7           DO7
In a one-horse open sleigh
FA
Jingle bells, jingle bells,

Jingle all the way!
SIb           FA
O what fun it is to ride
     DO7            FA     
In a one-horse open sleigh

  FA
A day or two ago,
                     SOLm7
I thought I'd take a ride,
                    DO7
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
                 FA
Was seated by my side
 
The horse was lean and lank
                      SOLm7
Misfortune seemed his lot
DO7
He got into a drifted bank,
                 FA   DO7
And we, we got upsot

FA
Jingle bells, jingle bells,

Jingle all the way!
SIb           FA
O what fun it is to ride
     SOL7           DO7
In a one-horse open sleigh
FA
Jingle bells, jingle bells,

Jingle all the way!
SIb           FA
O what fun it is to ride
     DO7            FA      
In a one-horse open sleigh

  FA
A day or two ago,
                 SOLm7
The story I must tell
                  DO7
I went out on the snow
                 FA
And on my back I fell

A gent was riding by
                    SOLm7
In a one-horse open sleigh,
              
He laughed as there
  DO7
I sprawling lie,
                   FA   DO7
But quickly drove away

FA
Jingle bells, jingle bells,

Jingle all the way!
SIb           FA
O what fun it is to ride
     SOL7           DO7
In a one-horse open sleigh
FA
Jingle bells, jingle bells,

Jingle all the way!
SIb           FA
O what fun it is to ride
     DO7            FA
In a one-horse open sleigh

FA
Now the ground is white
                   SOLm7
Go it while you're young,
                 DO7
Take the girls tonight
                        FA
And sing this sleighing song
              
Just get a bob-tailed bay
                 SOLm7
Two-forty as his speed
DO7
Hitch him to an open sleigh
                           FA   DO7
And crack! you'll take the lead

FA
Jingle bells, jingle bells,

Jingle all the way!
SIb           FA
O what fun it is to ride
     SOL7           DO7
In a one-horse open sleigh
FA
Jingle bells, jingle bells,

Jingle all the way!
SIb           FA
O what fun it is to ride
     DO7            FA
In a one-horse open sleigh
