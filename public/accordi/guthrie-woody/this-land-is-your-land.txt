RE  LA7  RE     SOL    RE    LA    RE

             SOL                        RE
This land is your land and this land is my land
         LA7                    RE
From California to the New York island
                 SOL                    RE
From the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters
LA7                            RE
This land was made for you and me
          SOL                    RE
As I went walking that ribbon of highway
       LA7                  RE
I saw above me that endless skyway
      SOL                RE
Saw below me that golden valley
LA7                            RE    
This land was made for you and me

SOL   RE   LA   RE   SOL   RE   LA   RE

             SOL
I roamed and rambled 
                     RE
and I've followed my footsteps
                 LA7                  RE
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
     SOL                  RE
All around me a voice was sounding
LA7                            RE
This land was made for you and me
                  SOL                 RE
When the sun come shining, then I was strolling
                     LA7
And the wheat fields waving 
                    RE
and the dust clouds rolling
              SOL                     RE
The voice was chanting as the fog was lifting
LA7                            RE
This land was made for you and me
             SOL                        RE      
This land is your land and this land is my land
         LA7                    RE
From California to the New York island
                 SOL                       RE
From the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters
LA7                            RE
This land was made for you and me

SOL   RE   LA   RE
