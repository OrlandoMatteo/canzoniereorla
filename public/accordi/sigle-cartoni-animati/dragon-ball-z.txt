Tether your soul to me

Strong enough to hold me

  SOLm        FA/LA        SIb
I started to question the angels
        DOm         SIb6      FA
And the answer they gave was you
MIb      FA            REm7      MIb  
I cannot promise there won’t be sadness
               FA             REm7
I wish I could take it from you
    MIb             FA         REm7      MIb
But you’ll find the courage to face the madness
