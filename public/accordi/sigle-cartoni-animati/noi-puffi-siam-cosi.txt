SIb
I was there to witness

Candice's inner business
    SOLm
She wants the boys to notice

Her rainbows, and her ponies
SIb
She was educated but could not count to ten
            SOLm
Now she got lots of different horses

By lots of different men
    
And I say
SIb
Liberate your sons and daughters
    SOLm                               FA/LA            
The bush is high but in the hole is water
SIb             
You can get some, when they give it
SOLm                MIb    FA
Nothing sacred, but it's a living

SIb
Hey, ho, here she goes
         SOLm7
Either a little too high or a little too low
    MIb
Low self-esteem and vertigo
                                     FA                  
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy
SIb
Hey, ho, here she goes
         SOLm7
Either a little too loud or a little too close
      MIb
Got a hurricane at the back of her throat
                             FA   SIb   SOLm
She thinks she's made of candy

SIb
Ring a ring of roses

Whoever gets the closest
    SOLm
She comes and she goes

As the war of the roses
SIb
Mother was a victim

Father beat the system
   SOLm
By moving bricks to Brixton

And learning how to fix them
SIb
Liberate your sons and daughters
    SOLm                                    FA/LA
The bush is high but in the hole there's water
SIb
As you will she'll be the whole of the law
          SOLm
And if it don't feel good
             MIb      FA
What are you doing it for
