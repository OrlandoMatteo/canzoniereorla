
             SOLm      SIb
My body is a cage that keeps me
                      MIb
From dancing with the one I love
       SOLm                  
But my mind holds the key
                       SIb    
My body is a cage that keeps me
                      MIb   
From dancing with the one I love
       SOLm
But my mind holds the key
             
I'm standing on a stage
   SIb           
Of fear and self-doubt
       MIb
It's a hollow play
                         SOLm
But they'll clap anyway
                       SIb
My body is a cage that keeps me
                      RE7
From dancing with the one I love
       MIb                 DOm
But my mind holds the key
       MIb                  DOm
You're standing next to me
   MIb                  DOm
My mind holds the key

                 SOLm
I'm living in an age
     SIb
That calls darkness light
          MIb
Though my language is dead
          SOLm
Still the shapes fill my head

I'm living in an age
      SIb
Whose name I don't know
           DOm
Though the fear keeps me moving
         SOLm
Still my heart beats so slow
                       SIb
My body is a cage that keeps me
                      RE
From dancing with the one I love
       MIb                 DOm
But my mind holds the key
       MIb                  DOm
You're standing next to me

My mind holds the key

My body is a

SOLm  SIb  DOm  SOLm

             SOLm
My body is a cage
   SIb            
We take what we're given
     MIb
Just because you've forgotten
           SOLm
That don't mean you're forgiven

I'm living in an age
             SIb
That screams my name at night
           DOm
But when I get to the doorway
        SOLm
There's no one in sight
                 
I'm living in an age
     SIb
That laughs

When I'm dancing
         RE
With the one I love
       MIb                DOm
But my mind holds the key
       MIb                  DOm
You're standing next to me
   MIb                 DOm
My mind holds the key
