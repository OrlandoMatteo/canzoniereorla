If the businessmen drink my blood
         FA#m                          SIm
Like the kids in art school said they would
       RE                       LA
Then I guess I'll just begin again
FA#m                           SIm
You say, "can we still be friends? "

   If I was scared... I would
             MI       LA       DO#m RE7+

All the kids have always known

That the emperor wears no clothes
         RE                    LA
But they bow down to him anyway
            FA#m                 SIm
'Cause it's better than being alone

RE7+        MI          RE7+

I would rather be wrong
     MI                          RE
Than live in the shadows of your song
           FA#m
My mind is open wide
    MI                RE   FA#m
And now I'm ready to start

And now I'm ready to start
            
You're not sure
     FA#m
You open the door
    MI                 RE    FA#m
And step out into the dark
MI           
Now I'm ready
