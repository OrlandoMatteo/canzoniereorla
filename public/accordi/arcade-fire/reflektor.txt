SIm

SIm                        FA#m
 Trapped in a prison, in a prism of light
SIm                       FA#m
 Alone in the darkness, a darkness of white
RE6               LA6
We fell in love, alone on a stage,
   SIm
in the reflective age
                  FA#m
Entre la nuit, la nuit et l'aurore
SIm                  FA#m
Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts
RE6                   LA6
 If this is heaven, I don't know what it's for
   SIm
If I can't find you there, I don't care

  MIm       RE                   SIm
I thought I found a way to enter

it was just a reflector (Just a reflector)
  MIm       RE                   SIm
I thought I found the connector

it was just a reflector (Just a reflector)

        SIm                   FA#m
Now the signals we send are deflected again
SIm                      FA#m   
 We're so connected, but are we even friends?
RE6                  LA6
We fell in love when I was 19,
              SIm
and now we're staring at a screen
                  FA#m
Entre la nuit, la nuit et l'aurore
SIm                   FA#m
 Entre le royaume des vivants et des morts
RE6                 LA6
 If this is heaven, I need something more
       SIm
Just a place to be alone, cause you're my home

         SI
Just a reflection of a reflection

                           MI
but I see you on the other side

SIm                  LA/SI
Our song it skips on little silver disks
SIm                            SIm9
 Our love is plastic, and they break it to bits
SIm
 I want to break free,
SIm9
 but will they break me
SIm
down, down down, don't mess around
