When you grow up, livin' like a good boy oughta
         DOm                             SIb
And your mama, takes a shine to her best son

Something different, 
                           LAb
all the girls they seem to like you
             DOm
Cause you're handsome, 
                                SIb
like to talk and a whole lot of fun
             DOm           DOm/SIb 
But now your girl's gone a missin'
         LAm7/5-          FA    SIb
And your house has got an empty bed
             DOm              DOm/SIb
The folks'll wonder 'bout the wedding
           LAm7/5-     FA       SIb
They won't listen to a word you said

      SIb               
Gonna take your mama out all night
           LAb                   
Yeah we'll show her what it's all about
              MIb               
We'll get her jacked up on some cheap champagne
              SIb
We'll let the good times all roll out

And if the music ain't good, 

well it's just too bad
            LAb
We're gonna sing along no matter what
            MIb              
Because the dancers don't mind at the New Orleans
       SIb                        LAb  LA5
If you tip 'em and they make a cut
SIb
Do it
               LAb
Take your mama out all night
          MIb
So she'll have no doubt that 
                           SIb    LAb

       SIb                              LAb
It's a struggle, livin' like a good boy oughta
       DOm                                 SIb
In the summer, watchin' all the girls pass by

When your mama, 
                              LAb
heard the way that you'd been talking
           DOm
I tried to tell you, 
                           SIb
that all she'd wanna do is cry
       DOm               DOm/SIb
Now we end up takin' the long way home
LAm7/5-
Lookin' overdressed 
        FA                 SIb
wearin' buckets of stale cologne
        DOm                      DOm/SIb
It's so hard to see streets on a country road
          LAm7/5-        
When your glasses in the garbage
         FA                      SIb
And your Continental's just been towed
