LA LAadd9   LA4 LA

           LA    LAadd9   LA4 LA
I hold you in my arms
            LAadd9   LA4  LA 
As the band plays
                                LAadd9   LA4 LA
What are those words whispered, baby
            MI4   MI    MIadd9 MI
Just as you turn away
  LA           LAadd9   LA4 LA
I saw you last night
                   LAadd9   LA4 LA
Out on the edge of town
                    LAadd9   
I want to read your mind
        LA4          LA
To know just what I've got 
        MI4            MI     MIadd9 MI
in this new thing I've found

           FA#m   LA   RE LA
So tell me what I see
       FA#m    LA        RE LA
When I look in your eyes
        FA#m LA  MI
Is that you,     baby
   FA#m7  RE          RE/DO#  MI
Or just a brilliant disgu-----ise?

LA LAadd9   LA4 LA

                 LA        LAadd9   LA4 LA
I heard somebody call your name
                    LAadd9   LA4 LA
From underneath our willow
                LA        LAadd9   LA4 LA
I saw something tucked in shame
     MI4        MI      MIadd9 MI
Underneath your pillow
           LA            LAadd9   LA4 LA
Well I've tried so hard, baby
                 LAadd9   LA4 LA
But I just can't see
                  LAadd9   LA4 LA
What a woman like you
      MI4     MI   MIadd9 MI
Is doing with me

           FA#m   LA   RE LA
So tell me what I see
       FA#m    LA        RE LA
When I look in your eyes
        FA#m LA  MI
Is that you,     baby
   FA#m7  RE          RE/DO#  MI
Or just a brilliant disgu-----ise?
  
LA LAadd9   LA4 LA

LA LAadd9   LA4 LA

    MI
Now look at me, baby
                 LA
Struggling to do everything right
            RE
And then it all falls apart
     LA
When out go the lights
           MI
I'm just a lonely pilgrim
            RE
I walk this world in wealth
                       LA    
I want to know if it's you I don't trust
                   MI
'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself
 
                 LA     LAadd9   LA4 LA
Now you play the loving woman
                       LAadd9   LA4 LA 
I'll play the faithful man
                        LAadd9   LA4 LA
But just don't look too close
         MI4     MI      MIadd9 MI
Into the palm of my hand
         LA     LAadd9   LA4 
We stood at the alter
          LA                   LAadd9  LA4 LA
The gypsy swore our future was right
                     LAadd9
But come the wee wee hours
     LA4   LA       MI4   MI   MIadd9 MI
Well maybe baby the gypsy lied

            FA#m    LA  RE LA
So when you look at me
                FA#m          LA    RE LA
You better look hard and look twice
        FA#m LA  MI
Is that me,      baby
   FA#m7  RE          RE/DO#  MI
Or just a brilliant disgu-----ise?
  
LA LAadd9   LA4 LA

LA LAadd9   LA4 LA

            LA     LAadd9   LA4 
Tonight our bed is cold
     LA                     LAadd9   LA4 
Lost in the darkness of our love
         LA           LAadd9   LA4 LA      
God have mercy on the man
                MI4       MI
Who doubts what he's sure of...
