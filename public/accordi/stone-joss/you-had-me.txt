You cost me
                      SI7/RE#
I don't want you here messing with my mind

MIm7                      SI7/RE#

SI7           MIm7

              MIm7

You tried to trade on my naivete
        MIm7                       SI7/RE#
But the things you do and say embarrass me
    MIm7                   SI7/RE#
See once upon a time I was your fool
        MIm7                 SI7/RE#

I'm taking back my life
LAm7                  SIm7
Vodka and a packet of cigarettes
       DO7+
That's all it used to be but now
       LAm7                         SIm7
You're sniffing on snow when you're feeling low
DO7+
Suffocating dreams that could have been
LAm7                     SIm7
Maybe for a minute I was down with that
       DO7+
But it didn't take long for me to see the light
LAm7                  SIm7
 You swore you had control of it
         DO7+                                   MIm
But when I stepped back you slipped on your supply
