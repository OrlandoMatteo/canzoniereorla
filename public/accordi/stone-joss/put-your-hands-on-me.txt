 I guess I'm picky with love
          SOLm
Well baby I give it up it's you I choose
SIb
 And don't keep me waiting
     SOLm
This girl's got things she needs to do
  FA7
Oh if I was blind, you'd help me see
                                    
If I lost my mind, you'd find it for me
   
Speak on it babe tell me what do you need
                                           SIb
Because all I need is for you to love me baby

                     
Put your hands on me baby

Put your hands on me baby

You got me flipping

Put your hands on me baby

Put your hands on me baby

SIb
 Can't stop my mind from thinking of you
SOLm
How am I supposed to function
       SIb
Got me feelin' for your lips on my kiss
                 SOLm
All night, never want no other lover
FA7
 Baby I'm hungry

I want and I need

Bring me your sugar
                         SIb
And pour it all over me baby


Put your hands on me baby

Put your hands on me baby

You got me flipping

Put your hands on me baby

Put your hands on me baby

FA7      
 Up till now my eyes could see

Touch me once and it's all hazy

I don't know why and I don't know how
                             SIb
But somehow some way you got me

I can't explain can't comprehend the world 

could reacht its very end and all I focus on is him

The way he moves, he found his groove there's 

nothing left to do but tell the world the truth

Cause there's no way out
  
I love him

I feel him

Oh I'm lovin' those hands

                     SIb
Put your hands on me baby

You got me flipping

One more time

Put your hands on me baby

Put your hands on me baby
       
One taste I'm trippin
                                  FA7
Just kiss me baby, tell me you're mine
                     SIb    
Put your hands on me baby 

FA7
