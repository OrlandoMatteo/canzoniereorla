Lately I've been wondering what's been going on
SOL                                 LAm
I've been here before but I don't remember when
                                     DO
And every time we get to where we're entering
SOL                           LAm
I feel my beliefs and hopes surrendering
DO/SI DO  SOL             LAm       DO DO/SI LAm
But I know I'll be coming home soon

And yes
  DO   SOL                  LAm       
I know  that I'll be coming home soon

DO DO/SI LAm     DO DO/SI 

       LAm                          DO
'Cause like the enemies that we are battling
SOL                      LAm
I am nothing but a human alien
                                   DO
Left with nothing else but to keep wandering
SOL                                     LAm
Down this path whilst stopping my hands trembling

  DO/SI   DO   SOL                  LAm       
Because I know  that I'll be coming home soon
    DO/SI
And yes
  DO   SOL                   LAm
I know   that I'll be coming home soon 

DO DO/SI LAm     DO DO/SI LAm

                 MIm   SOL 
with a soldier's eyes
                 LAm   DO DO/SI LAm
With a soldier's eyes
                 MIm   SOL
With a soldier's eyes
                 LAm
With a soldier's eyes
                             DO
I've seen inside the devil's dreams 

where young men die
    SOL
And graveyards open up their arms 
    LAm
for mothers left to cry

I have seen the bleeding 
    DO
and I hate what we've done
    SOL 
But just like every other fool 
LAm
I'll keep marching on
  DO/SI   DO   SOL                  LAm
Because I know  that I'll be coming home soon
    DO/SI
And yes
  DO   SOL                  LAm   
I know, that I'll be coming home soon 
                 MIm   SOL
with a soldier's eyes
                 LAm   DO DO/SI LAm
With a soldier's eyes
                MIm    SOL
With a soldier's eyes
                LAm      DO  DO/SI  LAm
With a soldier's eyes...
