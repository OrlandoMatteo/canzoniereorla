LAbadd9     SOLm    SIbm9    MIb    LAb

LAb
Every generation
REb7+
Blames the one before
    LAb
And all of their frustrations
     REb7+
Come beating on your door
  SOLb6
I know that I'm a prisoner
  
To all my Father held so dear
  SIbm
I know that I'm a hostage
     
To all his hopes and fears
       MIb
I just wish I could have 
         REb/MIb MIb    LAb
told him in the  living years

Oh, crumpled bits of paper
       REb7+
Filled with imperfect thought
LAb
Stilted conversations
     REb7+
I'm afraid that's all we've got
    SOLb6
You say you just don't see it

He says it's perfect sense
    SIbm7
You just can't get agreement

In this present tense
       MIb
We all talk a different language
REb/MIb MIb  LAb
Talking in defence

       LAb
Say it loud (say it loud), 
       REb
say it clear (oh say it clear)
        SIbm      MIb7/4      LAb
You can listen as well as you hear
         
It's too late (it's too late) 
        REb
when we die (oh when we die)
     SIbm         MIb7/4     LAb
To admit we don't see eye to eye

      LAb
So we open up a quarrel
            REb7+
Between the present and the past
        LAb
We only sacrifice the future
         REb7+
It's the bitterness that lasts
   LAb/SOLb
So don't yield to the fortunes

You sometimes see as fate
       SIbm
It may have a new perspective

On a different day
           MIb
And if you don't give up, and don't give in
                  LAb
You may just be okay

          LAb          REb
So say it loud, say it clear (oh say it clear)
        SIbm      MIb         LAb
You can listen as well as you hear

Because it's too late, 
         
it's too late (it's too late) 
        REb
when we die (oh when we die)
     SIbm         MIb        LAb
To admit we don't see eye to eye

  LAb
I wasn't there that morning
        REb7+
When my Father passed away
  LAb
I didn't get to tell him
        REb7+
All the things I had to say
  LAb/SOLb
I think I caught his spirit

Later that same year
    SIbm
I'm sure I heard his echo

In my baby's new born tears
       MIb
I just wish I could have told him 
REb/MIb MIb     LAb
in the  living years

       LAb          REb
Say it loud, say it clear (oh say it clear)
        SIbm      MIb         LAb
You can listen as well as you hear

It's too late (it's too late) 
        REb
when we die (it's too late when we die)
     SIbm         MIb        LAb
To admit we don't see eye to eye
                          
So say it, say it, say it loud (say it loud)
       REb
Say it clear (come on say it clear)...
