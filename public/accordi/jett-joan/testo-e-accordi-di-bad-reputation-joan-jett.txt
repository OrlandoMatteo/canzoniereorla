I don't give a damn about my reputation
                                                 
You're living in the past, it's a new generation
       MI                   FA#
Hey, a girl can do what she wants to do
    MI              SI    FA#
And that's what I'm gonna do

And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation

SI  MI  FA#  SI

   SI  MI  FA#  SI
Oh no
    SI  MI  FA#  SI
Not me
                                           SI
And I don't give a damn about my reputation

I never said I wanted to improve my station
        MI                         FA#
And I'm only feeling good when I'm having fun
      MI            SI        FA#
And I don't have to please no one

And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation

SI  MI  FA#  SI

DO#
And I don't give a damn about my reputation

I've never been afraid of any deviation
      FA#               SOL#
And I don't really care if I'm strange
  FA#   DO#   SOL#    
I ain't gonna change

And I don't give a damn about my bad reputation

DO#  FA#  SOL#  DO#

DO#     
                                            DO#
And I don't give a damn about my reputation

The world's in trouble, there's no communication
    FA#                        SOL#
And everyone can say what they want to say
   FA#        DO#       SOL#
It never gets better anyway
   DO#
So why should I care about a bad reputation
DO#  FA#  SOL#  DO#
     any-way
