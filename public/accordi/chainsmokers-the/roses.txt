
MI
 Taking it slow, but it's not typical

He already knows that my love is fire
                                           
His heart was a stone, but then his hands roamed
                                  DO#m
I turned him to gold and took him higher
                   LA                     MI
Well, I'll be your daydream, I'll be your favorite things
                      DO#m
We could be beautiful
                 LA                          MI
Get drunk on the good life, I'll take you to paradise
                           
Say you'll never let me go
DO#m
Deep in my bones, I can feel you
        LA
Take me back to a time only we knew
         MI
Hideaway
DO#m
We could waste the night with an old film
               LA
Smoke a little weed on my couch in the back room
         MI
Hideaway
                          DO#m  LA  MI
Say you'll never let me go
                          DO#m  LA  MI
