SIbm7   LAb REb/FA  SOLb     SIbm7   LAb REb

       SOLb     SIbm7          LAb      REbadd9/FA
I'll tell you a story before it tells itself
         SOLb       SIbm7
I'll lay out all my reasons, 
           LAb         REb
you'll say that I need help
           SOLb   SIbm7
We all got expectations, 
              LAb     REbadd9/FA
and sometimes they go wrong
           SOLb    SIbm7
But no one listens to me, 
         LAb        REb
so I put it in this song
     SOLb    SIbm7    
They tell me think with my head, 
LAb       REbadd9/FA    
 not that thing in my chest
SOLb           SIbm7           LAb   REb
They got their hands at my neck this time
SOLb           SIbm7
But you're the one that I want, 
LAb        REbadd9/FA
 if that's really so wrong
SOLb            SIbm7             LAb      REb
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

SOLb      SIbm7    LAb
And I say yeah-eah
     REbadd9/FA   SOLb
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
SIbm7    SOLb    REb
Yeah-eah    Yeah-eah-eah-eah
    SOLb  SIbm7    LAb REbadd9/FA  SOLb
And I say yeah-eah...

SIbm7    LAb REb/FA

       SOLb      SIbm7
I'll tell them a story, 
               LAb        REbadd9/FA
they'll sit and nod their heads
         SOLb     SIbm7  
I tell you all my secrets, 
             LAb      REb
and you tell all your friends
        SOLb     SIbm7
Hold on to your opinions, 
            LAb       REbadd9/FA
and stand by what you said (stand by what you said)
            SOLb      SIbm7
In the end, it's my decision, 
             LAb         REb
so it's my fault when it ends
     SOLb    SIbm7    
They tell me think with my head, 
LAb       REbadd9/FA    
 not that thing in my chest
SOLb           SIbm7           LAb   REb
They got their hands at my neck this time
SOLb           SIbm7
But you're the one that I want, 
LAb        REbadd9/FA
 if that's really so wrong
SOLb            SIbm7             LAb      REb
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

SOLb      SIbm7    LAb
And I say yeah-eah
     REbadd9/FA   SOLb
Yeah-eah-eah-eah
SIbm7    SOLb    REb
Yeah-eah    Yeah-eah-eah-eah
    SOLb  SIbm7    LAb REbadd9/FA  SOLb
And I say yeah-eah...

SIbm7    LAb REb/FA

       SOLb     SIbm7          LAb      REbadd9/FA
I'll tell you a story before it tells itself

Then they don't know what this feeling is like
   SOLb        SIbm7 LAb REb
My friends say no-o,  no-o-o
    SOLb  
But they don't know
SIbm7 LAb  REb
No-o,   no-o-o
SOLb  SIbm7 LAb REbadd9/FA
Yeah, no-o,  no-o-o
SOLb       SIbm7
They don't know
    LAb  REb
No-o, no-o-o...

    SOLb  SIbm7   LAb REbadd9/FA    
And I say no...

SOLb  SIbm7   LAb REb

SOLb       SIbm7   LAb REbadd9/FA    SOLb
And I say, yeah...
SIbm7        LAb REb   SOLbadd9
They don't know, oh
