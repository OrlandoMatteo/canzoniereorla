We were staying in Paris
                      SIm
To get away from your parents
                                LA
And I thought, "Wow, if I could take this in a shot right now
        FA#m7
I don't think that we could work this out"
           SOLadd9
Out on the terrace
                     SIm          
I don't know if it's fair but I thought, 
                     LA
"How could I let you fall by yourself
          FA#m7
While I'm wasted with someone else?"
   SOLadd9         SIm
If we go down then we go down together
        LA 
They'll say you could do anything
        FA#m7
They'll say that I was clever
   SOLadd9         SIm
If we go down then we go down together
      LA
We'll get away with everything
      FA#m7                    SOLadd9
Let's show them we are better
      SIm                      LA

To get away from your parents
                                 LA
You look so proud standing there with a frown and a cigarette
        FA#m7
Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet
           SOLadd9
Out on the terrace
                  SIm    
We breathe in the air of this small town
       LA 
On our own cuttin' class for the thrill of it
        FA#m7
Getting drunk on the past we were livin' in
