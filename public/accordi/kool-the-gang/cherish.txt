Let's take a walk together near the ocean shore
SOLb7+                  
 Hand in hand you and I

Let's cherish every moment we have been given
SOLb7+
 The time is passing by
MIbm7/9                FAm7

If you receive your calling before I awake

Could I make it through the night

The world is always changing

Nothing stays the same

 But love will stand the test of time

The next life that we live in

Remains to be seen
