
MI                      
 Purple washes over me
                         LA
Seeping through my open seams
                MI
I'm stained all over
                          
You pretend we've started again
                       LA
Waiting for me to say when
          MI
But I say purple

DO#m7     SI
She won't go
      LA
Where I
FA#m7          DO#m
I would go for you
    SI       LA
I'd curse my heart
    MI
For you

MI
 Silence makes a girl talk fast
                        LA
Speeding but I'm gonna crash
             MI
And burn for loves sake

Duty keeps a lover loyal
                             LA
But is it really worth the spoils
             MI
When I dream purple

DO#m7     SI
She won't go
      LA
Where I
FA#m7          DO#m
I would go for you
    SI       LA
I'd curse my heart
DO#m7     SI
She won't go
      LA
Where I
FA#m7          DO#m
I would go for you
    SI       LA
I'd curse my heart
     LAm   LAm9   MI
For you

LAm  LAm9  SI4 SI  SI4 SI

SI6 SI7 SI    

DO#m7     SI
She won't go
      LA
Where I
FA#m7          DO#m
I would go for you
    SI       LA
I'd curse my heart
DO#m7     SI
She won't go
      LA
Where I
FA#m7          DO#m
I would go for you
    SI       LA
I'd curse my heart
     MI
For you...   for you...

For you
