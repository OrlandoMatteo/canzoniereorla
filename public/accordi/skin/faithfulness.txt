
LAm9
Faithfulness

Distracts me from my ever changing
SOL6
Tastefulness

My mouth upon the richest tongues
  FA
I run for this
                              REm9
Static at the same time by it all
LAm9
Common sense

Can slap me in the face
          SOL6
And yet I condescend

Embarrassed by your obvious
  FA
Indifference
                                 REm9
Disgusted at the same time by it all
                               LAm  LAm7+ SOL
Watching as my ego breaks your fall

LAm9
Leave you now

Can't convince myself
                SOL6
That you're the one somehow

To free me from this smile
          FA
I call my loneliness
                                  REm9
Stuck inside this need to feel complete

Now I've left you standing on your feet
