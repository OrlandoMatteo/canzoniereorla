 Don't put him down as arrogant
LA7/4                        DO5
 His reserve, a quiet defense

Is what you say about socie--ty
MIm       MIm/FA# SOL6      MIm/LA

He gets by on you

 To any god or government

 Always hopeful, yet discontent

And the energy you trade
                     
He gets right on to the friction of the day...
