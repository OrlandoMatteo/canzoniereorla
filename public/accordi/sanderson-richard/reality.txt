SIm           SOL                LA           SIm
 I know there's something in the wake of your smile
      SOL               LA           SIm
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yea
             SOL             LA          SIm
You've built a love but that love falls apart
                           SOL         MIm
Your little piece of heaven  turns too dark

               SIm  SOL
Listen to your heart

 Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
          SOL                LA          SIm
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yea
           SOL                 LA         SIm
They're swept away and nothing is what it seems,
                        SOL        MIm
The feeling of belonging  to your dreams
