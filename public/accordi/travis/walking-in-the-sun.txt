I was walking along in the su---n
       LA          SIm7 RE MI7/4 
Taking pictures of everyo---ne
             LA              SIm7      RE             
And there's something on the tip of my tongue
MI7/4  LA  SIm7  RE  MI7/4
Oh
          LA      SIm7       RE MI7/4
Well it's easy to see from afa---r
         LA      SIm7       RE  MI7/4
And it's easy to be on your gua--rd
         LA             SIm7        RE 
But it's harder just to be who you are
 MI7/4  LA  SIm7  
Oh
     RE  MI7/4
When all these

They're on your back
RE                LA        MI
They will try and tear you apart
      LA                 MI
But believe and you will see that 
           SIm7      RE
there's no reason to doubt
         SIm7
Then you will find
RE              LA     MI  LA  SIm7  RE  MI7/4
You can do much better than that

LA  SIm7  RE  MI7/4

       LA               SIm7            RE MI7/4
If you think of all the things that you fe--el
        LA             SIm7          RE  MI7/4
All the voices in your head that you he--ar
       LA           SIm7             RE  MI7/4
It's a mystery that we are all still holding

on
     RE  MI7/4
When all these

LA              MI                SIm7

Taking pictures of everyone
