  SOLm                                  MIb
Well I believe there's someone watching over you
        FA                                   SOLm
They're watching everything single thing you say
                                          MIb
And when you die they'll set you down and take you through
       FA
You'll realise one day how...........

That the grass is always greener on the otherside
    FA6/LA
The neighbour's got a new car that you wanna drive
         SOLm                                       MIb
And when time is running out you want to stay alive....
   FA
We all live under the same sky, we all will live, 

we all will die, there is no
                                                     SOLm
wrong, there is no right, the circle only has one side

   SOLm                              MIb
We all try hard to live our lives in harmony
    FA                           SOLm
For fear of falling swiftly overboard
                               MIb
But life is both a major and a minor key
     FA
Just open up the chord.....
