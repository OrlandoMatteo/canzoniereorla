Baby, you've been going so crazy
                            FA#m
Lately, nothing seems to be going right
                             SIm7
Solo, why do you have to get so low

You're so
                           FA#m
You've been waiting in the sun too long
           LA    MI  SIm7
But if you sing, sing, 
                  LA  
sing, sing, sing, sing
                       MI           SIm7
For the love you bring won't mean a thing
                             LA
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing

FA#m                     SIm7
Colder, crying over your shoulder
                                   FA#m
Hold her and tell her everything's gonna be fine
                              SIm7
Surely, you've been going too early
                                FA#m
Hurry, 'cause no one's gonna be stopped

Nah, nah, nah, nah
           LA    MI  SIm7
But if you sing, sing, 
                  LA
sing, sing, sing, sing
                       MI           SIm7
For the love you bring won't mean a thing
                        LA
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing

LA  MI  SIm7     LA

LA  MI  SIm7     LA

FA#m                            SIm7
Baby, there's something going on today
         FA#m               
But I say nothing, nothing, nothing
                  SIm7
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
FA#m
So, nah, nah, nah, nah
           LA   MI   SIm7                LA
But if you sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
                       MI           SIm7
For the love you bring won’t mean a thing
                        LA
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing
                  MI SIm7               LA
Oh, baby, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
                       MI            SIm7
For the love you bring won’t mean a thing
                             LA
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing
