LA            RE
Everything is open
MI
Nothing is set in stone
LA             RE
Rivers turn to oceans
MI
Oceans tide you home
LA                RE
Home is where the heart is
    MI
But your heart had to roam
LA            RE
Drifting over bridges
MI
Never to return
MI7
Watching bridges burn 

       LA        MI            SIm7/9
You're driftwood floating underwater
              RE
Breaking into pieces, pieces, pieces
     LA         MI               SIm7/9
Just driftwood, hollow and of no use
                RE
Waterfalls will find you, bind you, grind you

LA           RE
Nobody is an island
MI4             MI
Everyone had to go
LA              RE
Pillars turn to butter
MI4          MI
Butterflying low
LA                RE
Low is where your heart is
    MI4               MI
But your heart has to grow
LA             RE
Drifting under bridges
MI4            MI
Never with the flow
        SIm7/9                       MI
And you really didn't think it would happen
       SIm7/9                   MI
But it really is the end of the line

       LA    MI                    SIm7/9
So I'm sorry that you've turned to driftwood
                RE                        LA
But you've been drifting for a long, long time

SIm7/9  MI  SIm7/9  MI

SIm7/9  MI  SIm7/9 

LA                 RE
Everywhere there's trouble
MI
Nowhere's safe to go
LA             RE
Pushes turn to shovels
MI
Shovelling the snow
LA              RE
Frozen you have chosen
MI4                  MI
The path you wish to go
LA             RE
Drifting now forever
MI4         MI
And forever more
  MI7
Until you reach your shore

       LA        MI            SIm7/9
You're driftwood floating underwater
              RE
Breaking into pieces, pieces, pieces
     LA         MI               SIm7/9
Just driftwood, hollow and of no use
                RE
Waterfalls will find you, bind you, grind you
        SIm7/9                       MI
And you really didn't think it would happen
       SIm7/9                   MI
But it really is the end of the line
        LA   MI                    SIm7/9    
So I'm sorry that you've turned to driftwood
                RE                        LA
But you've been drifting for a long, long time
            SIm7/9                     LA
You've been drifting, for a long, long time
SIm7/9
Drifting for a long, long  
RE                        LA
Drifting for a long, long time
