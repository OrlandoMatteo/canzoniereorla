MI                      DO#m
  I can't sleep tonight
                                     MI7+
Everybody saying everything's alright
                             DO#m
Still I can't close my eyes
                                            LA
I'm seeing a tunnel at the end of all these lights
      SI4     LAadd9
Sunny days
               SI4
Where have you gone?
  LA      LA/SOL#    FA#m7 FA#m7/MI SI
I get the strangest feeling   you belong

MI                  SI          LA
 Why does it always rain on me?
      MI/SOL#    FA#m7            LA6/MI
Is it because I lied when I was seventeen?
MI                  SI
 Why does it always rain on me?
LA             MI/SOL#
 Even when the sun is shining
FA#m7     LA6/MI         MI
 I can't avoid the lightning

                     DO#m
I can't stand myself
                                   MI7+
I'm being held up by an invisible man
                          DO#m
Still life on a shelf when
                                LA
I got my mind on something else
