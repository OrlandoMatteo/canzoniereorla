Home ... is where I want to be
        RE         MIm     DO7+  MIm
Pick me up ... and turn me round
       RE    MIm  DO7+             MIm
I feel numb ...   born with a weak heart
   RE              MIm    DO7+   MIm
 I guess I must be having fun

    RE           MIm         DO7+   MIm
The less we say about it the better
RE            MIm    DO7+  MIm
Make it up as we go along
RE          MIm     DO7+        MIm
Feet on the ground, head in the sky
RE      MIm              DO7+      MIm       
It's ok I know nothing's wrong ... nothing

RE  MIm  DO7+    MIm       RE   MIm   DO7+  MIm 
 Hi yo ... I got plenty of time
RE  MIm  DO7+      MIm           RE   MIm  DO7+  MIm 
 Hi yo ... you got light in your eyes              
           RE       MImm   DO7+    MIm   
And you're standing here beside me
RE          MIm        DO7+   MIm
 I love the passing of time
RE         MIm   DO7+        MIm    
 Never for money  always for love
RE           MIm     DO7+   MIm      RE   MIm  DO7+  MIm
Cover up and say goodnight  say good night

Home ... is where I want to be
      RE          MIm   DO7+   MIm
But I guess I'm already there
       RE    MIm    DO7+          MIm
I come home ... she lifted up her wings
  RE                   MIm     DO7+   MIm
I guess that this must be the place
RE           MIm       DO7+     MIm
I can't tell one from another
    RE             MIm      DO7+   MIm
Did I find you, or you find me?
RE          MIm    DO7+         MIm
There was a time before we were born
   RE            MIm             DO7+  
If someone asks, this where I'll be ... 
MIm        RE
where I'll be

RE  MIm  DO7+ MIm          RE  MIm  DO7+  MIm
 Hi yo ... we drift in and out
RE  MIm  DO7+   MIm      RE   MIm  DO7+  MIm
 Hi yo ... sing into my mouth
       RE        MIm      DO7+   MIm      
Out of all those kinds of people
RE         MIm         DO7+   MIm
 You got a face with a view
RE           MIm    DO7+          MIm   
 I'm just an animal looking for a home and
RE              MIm         DO7+     MIm  
 Share the same space for a minute or two
        RE      MIm     DO7+        MIm
And you love me till my heart stops
RE       MIm      DO7+   MIm
 Love me till I'm dead
RE               MIm DO7+              MIm
 Eyes that light up, eyes look through you
RE           MIm          DO7+           MIm  
Cover up the blank spots, hit me on the head like a ...
