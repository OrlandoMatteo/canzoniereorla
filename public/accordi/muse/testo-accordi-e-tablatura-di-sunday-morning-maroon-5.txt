  Sunday morning, rain is falling,
REm7         SOL7            DO7+
  steal some covers, share some skin
REm9         SOL13           DOadd9
  Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
    REm7             SOL7          DO7+
you twist to fit the mold that I am in
    REm7               SOL13
But things just get so crazy
        DOadd9
living life gets hard to do
            REm7           SOL
and I would gladly hit the road
           DO7+
get up and go if I knew
     REm9             SOL13            DOadd9
that someday it would lead me back to you,
     REm7             SOL             DO7+
that someday it would lead me back to you

            REm7   SOL7/6 DO7+
That may be all... I...  need,
                   REm7   SOL7/6 DO7+
In darkness she is all... I...   see
                   REm7     SOL7/6  DO7+
Come and rest your bones... with... me
                       REm7
Driving slow on Sunday morning,
      SOL7/6    DO7+
and I never want to leave

REm9      SOL7/5+             DO7+
  Fingers trace your every outline, oh yeah, yeah
REm7      SOL7             DO7+
  paint a picture with my hands
REm9       SOL13
  Back and forth
             DOadd9
we sway like branches in a storm
           REm7             SOL            DO7+
change the weather, still together when it ends

            REm7   SOL7/6 DO7+
That may be all... I...  need,
                   REm7   SOL7/6 DO7+
In darkness she is all... I...   see
                   REm7     SOL7/6  DO7+
Come and rest your bones... with... me
                       REm7

      SOL7/6    DO7+

Sunday morning, rain is falling
        DO7+
and I'm calling out to you
        REm9          SOL13             DOadd9
Singing someday it'll bring me back to you,
       REm7           SOL7               DO7+
find a way to bring myself back home to you

That may be all... I...  need,
