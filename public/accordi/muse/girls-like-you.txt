           SOL     SIm           DO
I miss you so much, I can't stand it
              SOL   SIm             RE
Seems like my heart, is breaking in two
             SOL  SIm            DO
My head says no    but my soul demands it
             SOL  RE  DO          SOL
Everything I do,    reminds me of you
                   SIm                       DO
I miss you so much, in this house full of shadows
                        SOL       SIm        RE
While the rain keeps pouring down, my window too
              SOL  SIm            DO
When will the pain, recede to the darkness
                   SOL  RE       DO            SOL
From whence it has come, and I'm feeling so blue

              DO                SIm
Ain't goin'down, no more to the well
             DO         RE               SOL  SOL7
Sometimes it feels like, I'm going to hell
                 DO                     SIm
Sometimes I'm knocking, on your front door
                 DO      RE          SOL
But I don't have nothing, to sell no more

               SOL    SIm               DO
Seems like the spirit, is pushing me on wards
              SOL  SIm                        RE
I'm able to see,    where I tripped and went wrong
                  SOL    SIm
I'll just have to guess, 
                           DO    
where my soul will find comfort
                   SOL  RE        DO         SOL
And I miss you so much,  when I'm singing my song

And sometimes it seems, I'm going to hell

You'll find me knocking, on your front door

'Till I'm able to see where, 
                      RE
I tripped when I went wrong
                  SOL    SIm
I'll just have to guess,

where my soul will get comfort
