SIb           MIb                   SIb
You, you who smiled when you're in pain
        MIb                      SIb
You who soldiered through the profane
            MIb                SIb  FA  MIb 
They were distracted and shut down
DOm7 SIb    FA        MIb            SIb
So why, why would you talk to me at all
              FA  MIb                SIb
Such words were dishonorable and in vain
         FA      MIb         SIb  FA
Their promise as solid as a fog
    MIb                       SIb
And where was your watchman then

                FA      MIb              DOm7 SIb
I'll be your keeper for life as your guardian
                   FA   MIb              DOm7 SIb
I'll be your warrior of care, your first warden
               FA     MIb              DOm7 SIb
I'll be your angel on call, I'll be on demand
               FA     MIb              DOm7 
The greatest honor of all as your guardian

SIb      FA     MIb        DOm7 SIb
You, you in the chaos feigning sane
    FA      MIb           DOm7     SIb
You who has pushed beyond what's humane
     FA     MIb        DOm7 SIb  FA
Them as the ghostly tumbleweed
    MIb                       SIb
And where was your watchman then

                FA      MIb              DOm7 SIb
I'll be your keeper for life as your guardian
                   FA   MIb              DOm7 SIb
I'll be your warrior of care, your first warden
               FA     MIb              DOm7 SIb
I'll be your angel on call, I'll be on demand
               FA     MIb               
The greatest honor of all as your guardian

SIb         MIb/SIb           SIb
Now no more smiling mid crest fall
            MIb/SIb       SIb
No more managing unmanageables
                MIb/SIb          SIb
No more holding still in the hailstorm
    DOm7       SIb/RE   MIb  FA  MIb   SIb       
Now enter your watch woman

                FA      MIb              DOm7 SIb
I'll be your keeper for life as your guardian
                   FA   MIb              DOm7 SIb
I'll be your warrior of care, your first warden
               FA     MIb              DOm7 SIb
I'll be your angel on call, I'll be on demand
               FA     MIb              
The greatest honor of all as your guardian...
