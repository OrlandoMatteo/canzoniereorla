      LAm7                           FA
Irish blood, English heart, this I'm made of
         LAm7                 FA
There is no one on earth I'm afraid of
    LAm7                         
And no regime can buy or sell me
FA/LA                    FA
 I've been dreaming of a time when
                           LAm
To be English is not to be baneful
      FA              
To be standing by the flag not feeling shameful
          LAm    LAm7 LAm6+ FA/LA LAm LAm7 LAm6+ 
Racist or partial

FA/LA LAm7                           FA/LA
Irish blood, English heart, this I'm made of
         LAm7                 FA/LA
There is no one on earth I'm afraid of
    LAm7            FA/LA              LAm7
And I will die with both of my hands untied
FA/LA                    FA
 I've been dreaming of a time when
    FA                           LAm
The English are sick to death of labor and Tories
                              FA       
And spit upon the name Oliver Cromwell
            
And denounce this royal line
             LAm    LAm7 LAm6+
That still salute him 
    FA/LA  LAm    LAm7 LAm6+ FA/LA FA
and will salute him  forever
