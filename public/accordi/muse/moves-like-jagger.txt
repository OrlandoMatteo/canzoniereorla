
SIm      MIm7
Oh...
         
Oh!
                   SIm
Just shoot for the stars

If it feels right
 
And aim for my heart

If you feel like
             MIm7           
And take me away and make it OK

I swear I'll behave
              SIm
You wanted control

So we waited

I put on a show

Now I make it
              MIm7
You say I'm a kid

My ego is big
               
I don't give a shit
                  SIm
And it goes like this (Uh)

Take me by the tongue

And I'll know you
                    
Kiss me 'til you're drunk

And I'll show you
        MIm7
All the moves like Jagger

I've got the moves like Jagger
             
I've got the moves like Jagger                 
SIm
 I don't need to try to control you

Look into my eyes and I'll own you
          MIm7
With them moves like Jagger

I've got the moves like Jagger
       
I've got the moves like Jagger
 
           SIm
Maybe it's hard

When you feel like you're broken and scarred

Nothing feels right
                     MIm7
But when you're with me

I'll make you believe

That I've got the key

Oh
              SIm
So get in the car

We can ride it

Wherever you want

Get inside it
                MIm7
And you want to steer

But I'm shifting gears
                
I'll take it from here (Oh! Yeah yeah!)

                 SIm
And it goes like this (Uh)

Take me by the tongue

And I'll know you (Uh)

Kiss me 'til you're drunk

And I'll show you
        MIm7
All the moves like Jagger

I've got the moves like Jagger
                                SIm              
I've got the moves like Jagger

I don't need to try to control you (Oh, yeah)

Look into my eyes and I'll own you
          MIm7
With them moves like Jagger

I've got the moves like Jagger (Yeah yeah)

SIm
 You wanna know how to make me smile
                                        MIm7
Take control, own me just for the night

And if I share my secret

You're gonna have to keep it
                          SIm
Nobody else can see this

So watch and learn

I won't show you twice
                                    MIm7
Head to toe, oooh baby rub me right

But if I share my secret

You're gonna have to keep it
                                         
Nobody else can see this (Ay! Ay! Ay! Aaay!)

                           SIm
And it goes like this (Uh)

Take me by the tongue

And I'll know you (Take me by the tongue)

Kiss me 'til you're drunk
