 'Ere the bonnie boat was won
                    MIb      MIbadd9 MIb
As we sailed into the mystic
                               MIbadd9
Hark now, hear the sailors cry
MIb                 
 Smell the sea and feel the sky
SIb                      
 Let your soul and spirit fly
         MIb
Into the mystic
SOLm                      LAb
 Yeah, when that fog horn blows
          MIb          SOLm
I will be coming home
                     LAb
Yeah, when that fog horn blows
        SIb
I wanna hear it

I don't have to fear it

     MIb                     
And I wanna rock your gypsy soul
                              
Just like way back in the days of old
