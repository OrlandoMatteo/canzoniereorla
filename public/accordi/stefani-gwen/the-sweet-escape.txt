If I could escape I would
             MIb7         SOLb
But first of all, let me say
        SIbm
I must apologize
    REb              MIb7              SOLb
For acting stank and treating you this way
                 SIbm                   REb
'Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
          MIb7                           SOLb
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
      SIbm                        REb        MIb7
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold?

             REb        LAb/DO                       SIbm
If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world
    FAm                        MIbm
And I could be your favourite girl forever

Perfectly together
    LAb7/4                           LAb7
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet?

(sweet escape)
              REb
If I could be sweet (be sweet)
  LAb/DO                    SIbm
I know I've been a real bad girl

(I'll try to change)
  FAm                        MIbm
I didn't mean for you to get hurt

(whatsoever)  We can make it better,
    LAb7/4                           FA7
And tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet?

            SIbm
You melt me down,
    REb          MIb7    SOLb
I'm at my lowest boiling point
             SIbm
Come help me out
  REb            MIb7        SOLb
I need to get me out of this joint
              SIbm
Come on let's bounce
    REb            MIb7     SOLb
Counting on you to turn me around
           SIbm       REb
Instead of clowning around
               MIb7        SOLb 
Let's look for some common ground
    SIbm
So, baby
REb                MIb7
Times get a little crazy
SOLb                SIbm
I've been gettin' a little lazy
REb                    MIb7
Waitin' on you to come save me
SOLb                  SIbm
I can see that you're angry
REb                 MIb7
By the way that you treat me
SOLb                SIbm
Hopefully you don't leave me
REb            MIb7
Wanna take you with me
