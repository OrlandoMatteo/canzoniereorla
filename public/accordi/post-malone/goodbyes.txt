FA  LA7  REm  SIb

FA
 Me and Kurt feel the same
                     LA7
Too much pleasure is pain

My girl spites me in vain
                 REm
All I do is complain

She needs something to change
                      SIb
Need to take off the e-e-edge
                  FA
So fuck it all tonight
                          LA7
And don't tell me to shut up
                           REm
When you know you talk too much
                          SIb
But you don't got shit to say (say)
                     SOLm   DO7
I want you out of my head
                     LAm       REm
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (bedroom)
                       SIb
There's no way I could save you (save you)
                    SIbm
'Cause I need to be saved too

                   FA
I'm no good at goodbyes
     
We're both actin' insane
                    LA7
But too stubborn to change

Now I'm drinkin' again
                 REm
80 proof in my veins

And my fingertips stained
                  SIb
Looking over the e-e-edge
                     FA
Don't fuck with me tonight
                                            LA7
Say you needed this heart, then you got it (got it)
                                          REm
Turns out that it wasn't what you wanted (wanted)
                                      SIb
And we wouldn't let go and we lost it

Blue diamond, no shark

Your Barbie life doll

                                             LA7
And I don't want you to never go outside (outside)
