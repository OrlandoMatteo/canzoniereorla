       MI  DO#m7/9  LAadd9

MI         DO#m7                    LAadd9
 She had a face straight out a magazine
MI        DO#m7                  LAadd9
 God only knows but you'll never leave her
MI       DO#m7                  LAadd9
 Her balaclava is starting to chafe
             MI                DO#m7
And when she gets his gun he's begging
          LAadd9
Babe, stay, stay, stay

(Stay, stay, stay)

              MI       SI
I'll give you one more time
               DO#m7    LAadd9
We'll give you one more fight
      MI       SI
Said, one more lie
     DO#m7    LAadd9  MI
Will I know you?

MI          DO#m7                      LAadd9
 Now if you never shoot, you'll never know
MI          DO#m7                    LAadd9
 And if you never eat, you'll never grow
MI            DO#m7               LAadd9
 You've got a pretty kinda dirty face
           MI
When she's leaving your home
      DO#m7             LAadd9
She's begging you to stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
              DO#m7    LAadd9
I'll give you one more time
               MI       SI/RE#
We'll give you one more fight
      DO#m7    LAadd9
Said, one more line
                           MI       SI
There'll be a riot, 'cause I know you

FA#m7                            MI/SOL#
 Well, now that you've got your gun
                                      LA
It's much harder now the police have come
                                 SI4
Now shoot him if it's what you ask
                                 DO#m7
But if you'd just take off your mask
                    SI              LAadd9
You'd find out that everything's gone wrong

MI               SI
 Now everybody's dead
            DO#m7            LAadd9
And they're driving past my old school
MI                    SI
 And he's got his gun, and he's got his suit on
DO#m7          LAadd9       MI   SI
 She says, babe, you look so cool
           LAadd9           MI     SI  LAadd9
You look so cool, you look so cool
          MI     SI         DO#m7  LAadd9
You look so cool, you look so cool
           MI    SI  DO#m7  LAadd9  MI
You look so cool
