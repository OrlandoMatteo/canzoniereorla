FAm
Hey! Would you

Like to

Look outside sometimes?

No!

I'm just with my friends online
                                 
And there's things we'd like to change! (yeah)
                       
Next thing you'll find you're
SIb7              DO7       SIb7
Reading about yourself on a plane (fame!)
DO7
What a shame!
SIb                  DO
Ohh! Well, just keep looking!
                            FA7  MI7     FA7  MI7
Looking! Looking! Looking!

And love me (yeah!)
                         FAm7           SIb7
If that's what you wanna do (oh, yeah!)
         FAm7        SIb7
And love me (yeah!)
                         FAm7           SIb7
If that's what you wanna do (oh, yeah!)

            FAm
You've been reading about yourself on a plane,

Fame for a change

Caught up in fashion, Karcrashian panache

And a bag of bash for passion

You've got a beautiful face 
             
but got nothing to say (Oh!)
                                   
"You look famous, let's be friends and portray 
 
we possess something important

And do the things we'd like"
SIb7               DO7
We've just come to represent
    SIb7              
A decline in the standards
DO7         SIb
Of what we accept!"
                DO
Yeah?!  Yeah?!  Yeah?!  No!

And love me (Yeah! Oh)
                         FAm7          SIb7
If that's what you wanna do (Oh, yeah)
         FAm7                SIb7          
And love me (Love me, yeah!)
                         FAm7           SIb7
If that's what you wanna do (Oh, yeah!)

      SIb7
Oh so sack off your calendar,
DO7
Give it to the people!
SIb7                 DO7 
Be the man that gets them up on their feet
     SIb             DO
Say "Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhh"

         FAm7      SIb7   FAm7    SIb7
And love me (Yeah!)        (Oh)
         FAm7         
And love me (Yeah!)
