 You wet my     eyes  but I don't mind it
       LAbadd9/DO REb6        SIbm7  MIb
I tell you    lies but it's only sometimes
         LAbadd9/DO REb6       SIbm7   MIb
You pick a   fight    and I'll define it
        LAbadd9/DO   REb6
I swear that    I, I swear that I
    SIbm7         MIb          LAbadd9/DO REb6
I only called her one time, maybe it was  two times
      SIbm7        MIb
Don't think it was three times, 
      LAbadd9/DO   REb6
can't be more than four times
      SIbm7      MIb   
Think we need to rewind, 
    LAbadd9/DO    REb6
you text that boy sometimes!
     SIbm7        MIb
Must be more than three times!
       LAbadd9/DO REb6             SIbm7 MIb
Didn't mean  to   two-time ya, two-time ya
         LAbadd9/DO REb6        SIbm7    MIb
She said that    I,  I should have liked it
       LAbadd9/DO REb6       SIbm7  MIb
I told her   "I     only use it sometimes"
       LAbadd9/DO REb6      SIbm7 MIb
Except when    I,    I need reminding
      LAbadd9/DO   REb6
I'm petrified, I'm petrified
        SIbm7         MIb
But I only called her one time
      LAbadd9/DO REb6
Maybe it was     two times?
      SIbm7        MIb
Don't think it was three times
       LAbadd9/DO REb6             
Didn't mean  to   two-time ya, 
    SIbm7 MIb FAm7  REbadd9     MIb FAm7  REbadd9
