  RE        LA/RE         SOL/RE
I see her online all the time
    RE     LA/RE
I'm trying not to stare down there
                                SOL/RE
While she talks about her tough time
RE        LA/RE                        SOL/RE
Girl of your dreams, you know what I mean
        RE         LA/RE
There's something 'bout her stare that makes you nervous
                                   SOL/RE
And you say things that you don't mean
        MIm7             RE/FA#
Well, I found my hotel I called up the twins
     MIm7                      RE/FA#
It's seven in the morning so they won't let me in
  MIm7
I need to get back
 RE/FA#                        SOL/LA
I've gotta see the girl on the screen

LA/RE                   SIm7                        SOL7+/9
"Maybe I would like you better if you took off your clothes
        LA/RE
I'm not playing with you, baby
  SIm7                            SOL7+/9
I think that you should give it a go"
           LA                     SIm7
She said, "Maybe I would like you better 
                     SOL
if you took off your clothes
        LA
I wanna see, and stop thinking
              SIm7
If you're too shy, then let me
MIm7                 SOL/LA     RE
Too shy, then let me know"

RE   LA/RE                                  SOL/RE
I've been wearing nothing every time I call you
   
(And I'm starting to feel weird about it)
RE  LA/RE 
Sometimes it's better if you think about it
     SOL/RE
This time, (I think I'm gonna drink through it)
      RE        LA/RE
But I see her online
                                                    SOL/RE
(And don't think that I should be calling) all the time

(I just wanted a happy ending)
           RE          LA/RE
And I'm pretending I don't care about her stare
                               SOL/RE
While she's giving me a tough time
        MIm7             RE/FA#
Well, I found a motel it looked like the bins
  MIm7                              RE/FA#
I think there'd been a murder so we couldn't get in
  MIm7
I need to get back
   RE/FA#                      SOL/LA
I've gotta see the girl on the screen
