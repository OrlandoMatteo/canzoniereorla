  SOLadd9     LA
A soft sound
                         SOLadd9
To the way she wears her hair down
                SIm7  LA
Covering up her face
          SOLadd9   LA
Oh what a let down
                                SIm7
I don't seem to be having any effect now
                     RE
Falling all over the place
           SOLadd9       
But you're losing your words
      LA
We're speaking in bodies
 RE/FA#                       SIm7  LA4
Avoiding me and talking 'bout you
           SOLadd9
But you're losing your turn
  LA           
I guess I'll never learn
        RE/FA#                 SIm7  LA4
Cause I stay another hour or two

    SOLadd9    LA    SIm7     RE 
For crying out loud, settle down
    SOLadd9         LA           RE/FA#  LA4
You know I can't be found with you
   SOLadd9        LA
We get back to my house
     SIm7     RE
Your arms, my mouth
    MIm7          RE/FA#      SOLadd9  LA4
Now I just stop myself around you

  SOLadd9     LA
A small town
                            RE/FA#
Dictating all the people we get around
                SIm7   LA
What a familiar face
                  SOLadd9   LA
Do you get what I mean now?
                                    SIm7
I'm so fixated on the girl with the soft sound
                      RE
And hair all over the place
           SOLadd9
But you're sure that I'd learn
    LA          
I'm pushing through bodies
 RE/FA#                        SIm7  LA
Avoiding me and walking around you
           SOLadd9
But you're cold and I burn
  LA
I guess I'll never learn
        RE/FA#                           
Cause I stay another hour or two

    SOLadd9    LA    SIm7     RE 
For crying out loud, settle down
