MI   DO7+  DO#m7/5-  LA

MI        DO7+             DO#m7/5-  LA
 It's the cruelest joke to play
MI      DO7+           DO#m7/5-  LA
 I'm so high, I run in place
MI      DO7+         DO#m7/5- LA
 Only a line, we separate,    so

MI                              SOL
 I keep on playing our favorite song
                          RE
I turn it up while you're gone
                                    RE#dim
It's all I've got when you're in my head

And you're in my head
              MI  DO7+  DO#m7/5-  LA
So I need it

MI          DO7+             DO#m7/5-  LA
 You're the only thing I've got
MI            DO7+          DO#m7/5-  LA
 That I can't seem to get enough
MI      DO7+          DO#m7/5- LA
 We collide for one embrace,   so

MI                              SOL
 I keep on playing our favorite song
