DO  LAm9 LAm  MIm

    DO                   LAm9
You wanna know if I know why?
                   MIm
I can't say that I do,
        DO                    LAm9
I don't understand the evil eye,
              MIm
Or how one becomes two
      DO                                LAm9
And I just can't recall what started it all,
                       MIm
Or how to begin in the end,
  DO      
I ain't here to break it,
     LAm9                MIm
Just see how far it will bend,

Again and again,

DO

DO
 I wanna make it,
LAm9                 MIm
 I wanna make it wit chu,

    DO          
Sometimes the same is different,
    LAm9            MIm
but mostly it's the same
      DO              LAm9                  MIm     
these mysteries of life, that just ain't my thing
     DO                             LAm9
if I told you that I knew about the sun and the moon,
        MIm
I'd be untrue,
         DO                    LAm9
The only thing I know for sure
                MIm
Is what I wanna do,
                            
anytime, anywhere and I say

DO                  LAm9
 I wanna make it, (again and again)
                     MIm
