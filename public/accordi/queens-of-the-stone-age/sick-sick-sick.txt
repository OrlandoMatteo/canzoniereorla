DO7

DO7
Young, dumb, don't see a problem

Bloodshot, stare like a hoodlum

Simple as this, I'm in love with the risk

I know what I've done but tell me 

what did I miss?

So please don't save something

Waste not, save nothing

Lose the halo, don't need to resist

A lick of the lips and a grip on your hips

DO7
Sick, sick, sick

Don't resist

Sick, sick, sick

Don't resist

DO7
First thing we succumb to

Shall erase and undo

Days are unreleased, if there's no release

Please just let me do whatever fits you

Make something, make someone

Beg on a knee, baby, baby please

Pout your bottom lip while cracking the whip

You know what we want, it's candy to cum to

DO7
Sick, sick, sick

Don't resist

Sick, sick, sick

Don't resist

Sick, sick, sick

Don't resist

Sick, sick, sick

Don't resist

DO7
 A total eclipse in the teeth of the risk

The tongue is a twist, perpetual bliss

Forever midnight, forever midnight

Forever midnight, forever

DO7
Sick, sick, sick

Don't resist

Sick, sick, sick

Don't resist

Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)

Don't resist (I don't wanna change)

Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)

Don't resist (I don't wanna change)

Baby, baby come out

C-c-c-come out

Baby, come out

C-c-c-come out

Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)

Don't resist (I don't wanna choose)

Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)

Don't resist (I don't wanna change)

Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)

Don't resist (I don't wanna choose)

Sick, sick, sick (I'm gonna take)

Don't resist (I don't wanna change)
