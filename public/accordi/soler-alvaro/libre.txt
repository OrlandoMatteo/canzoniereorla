 It's like we just can't help ourselves
DO         LAm              MIm  FA
 Cause we don't know how to back down
DO        LAm            MIm   FA
 We were called out to the streets
DO        LAm          MIm  FA
 We were called out to the towns, 
DO        LAm           MIm    FA
 how the heavens they opened up
DO     LAm         MIm  FA        
 Like arms of dazzling gold
DO         LAm          MIm    FA
 With our rain-washed histories 
DO        LAm          MIm  FA
 well we do not need to be told
LAm
Show me now
                
Show me the arms aloft
SOL6          
Every eye , trained on a different star
FA7+
This my chick
                            LAm   SOL
This drunken semaphore, and I

LAm
We are listening
    SOL     
And we're not blind
FA                      LAm       SOL
This is your life, this your time
LAm                   SOL          
We are listening, and were not blind
FA                         LAm        SOL
This is your life, this is your time

DO      LAm             MIm   FA
 I was called out in the dark
DO     LAm           MIm  FA
 By a choir of beautiful cheats
DO           LAm              MIm  FA
 And as the kids took back the parks
DO        LAm             MIm    FA
 You and I were left with the streets
LAm
Show me now
                 
Show me the arms aloft
SOL6
Every eye, trained on a different star
FA7+
This my chick
                 
This drunken semaphore
    LAm    SOL
And I, 

LAm
we are listening
    SOL
And we're not blind
FA
This Is your life
        LAm        SOL
This is your time
LAm
We are listening
    SOL     
And we're not blind
FA                 
This is your life

This is your time

We are listening
