            SOL#m
It ain't no joke
      DO#    SOL#m7         DO#
I'd like to buy the world a toke
              SOL#m    DO#      SOL#m7      DO#
And teach the world to sing in perfect harmony
              SOL#m    DO#
And teach the world to snuff 
    SOL#m7        DO#
the fires and the liars
       SOL#m            DO#
Hey, I know it's just a song, 
              SOL#m7     DO#
but it's spice for the recipe
          SOL#m  DO#
This is a love attack
               SOL#m7/5-     DO#
I know it went out, but it's back
               SOL#m DO#     SOL#m7/5-       DO#
It's just like any fad, it retracts before impact
              SOL#m
And just like fashion, 
       DO#             SOL#m7/5-    DO#
it's a passion for the with-it and hip
               SOL#m
If you got the goods, 
                 DO#            SOL#m7/5-    DO#
they'll come and buy it just to stay in the clique

SOL#m       DO#      SOL#m7/5-         DO#
 So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
         DO#            SOL#m7/5-
Allow if you're still alive
             DO#        SOL#m
Six to eight years to arrive
           DO#            SOL#m7/5- DO#
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
      SOL#m        DO#
But if the offer's shunned
     RE#7/9+                        SOL#m  DO#
You might as well be walking on the Sun

Twenty-five years ago, 
      SOL#m7            DO#
they spoke out and they broke out
     SOL#m        DO#
Of recession and oppression 
      SOL#m7       DO#
and together they toked
         SOL#m      DO#      SOL#m7       DO#
And they folked out with guitars around a bonfire
     SOL#m          DO#
Just singin' and clappin', man, 
 SOL#m7         DO#
what the hell happened?
               SOL#m       DO#        SOL#m7/5-
Then some were spellbound, some were hellbound
           DO#            SOL#m         DO#
Some, they fell down and some got back up
     SOL#m7/5-              DO#  
And fought back against the meltdown
          SOL#m            DO#         
And their kids were hippie chicks, 
     SOL#m7/5-  DO#
all hypo------crites
        SOL#m         DO#            SOL#m7/5-   DO#
Because fashion is smashing the true meaning of it

SOL#m       DO#      SOL#m7/5-         DO#
 So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
         DO#            SOL#m7/5-
Allow if you're still alive
             DO#        SOL#m
Six to eight years to arrive
           DO#            SOL#m7/5- DO#
And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
      SOL#m        DO#
But if the offer's shunned
     RE#7/9+                        SOL#m  DO#

            SOL#m
It ain't no joke
       DO#           SOL#m7   DO#
When a mama's handkerchief is soaked
         SOL#m
With her tears 
            DO#             SOL#m7 DO#
because her baby's life has been revoked
            SOL#m
The bond is broke up
   DO#           SOL#m7      DO#
So choke up and focus on the close up
    SOL#m           DO#     SOL#m          DO#
Mr. Wizard can't perform no god-like hocus-pocus

         SOL#m     DO#
So don't sit back, kick back
    SOL#m7/5-           DO#
And watch the world get bushwhacked
        SOL#m            DO#     SOL#m7/5- DO#
News at 10, your neighborhood is under   attack
             SOL#m
Put away the crack, 
           DO#   SOL#m7/5- DO#
before the crack puts you away
            SOL#m
You need to be there 
          DO#         RE#7/9+
when your baby's old enough to relate

SOL#m       DO#      SOL#m7/5-         DO#
 So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
