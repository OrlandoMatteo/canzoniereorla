
      SOLm7  MIb  SIb  FA#4+ 
Come on...
 SOLm7  MIb  SIb  FA#4+
Ooh,     yeah...

SOLm7  MIb  SIb  FA#4+  SOLm7  MIb  SIb  FA#4+

SOLm7       MIb         SIb           FA#4+
 I call you up whenever things go wrong
SOLm7          MIb               SIb           FA#4+
 You're always there, you are my shoulder to cry on
SOLm7       MIb             SIb         FA#4+
 I can't believe it took me quite so long
   SOLm7              MIb  
To take the forbidden step
        SIb              FA#4+   SOLm7  MIb  SIb 
Is this something that I might regret?
        FA#4+             SOLm7
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
     MIb     SIb
(You are the one)
         FA#4+               SOLm7
A lonely heart that can't be tamed
      MIb       SIb
(Come on, come on)
           FA#4+             SOLm7  MIb
I'm hoping that you feel the same
        SIb              FA#4+      SOLm7
This is something that I can't forget

               MIb               SIb
I thought that we would just be friends
            FA#4+              SOLm7
Things will never be the same again
                MIb                   SIb
It's just the beginning, it's not the end
            FA#4+               SOLm7
Things will never be the same again
           MIb       SIb
It's not a secret anymore
          FA#4+          SOLm7
Now we've opened up the door
           MIb                 SIb
Starting tonight and from now on
             FA#4+               SOLm7
We'll never, never be the same again
 MIb                SIb
(Never be the same again)
FA#4+              SOLm7 
Never be the same again
 MIb                SIb  FA#4+
(Never be the same again)

SOLm7   MIb              SIb       FA#4+
 Now I know that we were close before
SOLm7       MIb        SIb              FA#4+
 I'm glad I realized I need you so much more
SOLm7        MIb            SIb        FA#4+
 And I don't care what everyone will say
SOLm7              MIb  
It's about you and me 
          SIb          FA#4+   SOLm7
and we'll never be the same again

               MIb               SIb
I thought that we would just be friends
            FA#4+              SOLm7
Things will never be the same again
                MIb                   SIb
It's just the beginning, it's not the end
            FA#4+               SOLm7
Things will never be the same again
           MIb       SIb
It's not a secret anymore
          FA#4+          SOLm7
Now we've opened up the door
           MIb                 SIb
Starting tonight and from now on
             FA#4+               SOLm7
We'll never, never be the same again
 MIb                SIb
(Never be the same again)
FA#4+              SOLm7 
Never be the same again
 MIb                SIb   FA#4+
(Never be the same again)

                        SOLm
Uh, check it, night and day, 
                        MIb
black beach sand to red clay
           SIb        FA#4+                    SOLm
The US to UK, NYC to LA, from sidewalks to highways
                        MIb
See, it'll never be the same, what I'm sayin'
    SIb                           FA#4+
My mind frame never changed 'til you came rearranged
    SOLm                  MIb
But sometimes it seems completely forbidden
     SIb
To discover those feelings 
        FA#5
that we kept so well hidden
        SOLm
Where there's no competition 
        MIb
and you render my condition
         SIb
Though improbable it's not impossible
      FA#5                          
For a love that could be unstoppable
         SOLm                   MIb
But wait, a fine line's between fate and destiny
         SIb
Do you believe in the things 
          FA#5
that were just meant to be?
        SOLm                         MIb
When you tell me the stories of your quest for me
     SIb                             FA#5
Picturesque is the picture you paint effortlessly
          SOLm                MIb
And as our energies mix and begin to multiply
     SIb                  FA#4+
Everyday situations, they start to simplify
   SOLm                             MIb
So things will never be the same between you and I
   SIb  
We intertwined our life forces 
    FA#4+             SOLm7
and now we're unified

               MIb               SIb
I thought that we would just be friends
            FA#4+              SOLm7
Things will never be the same again
                MIb                   SIb
It's just the beginning, it's not the end
            FA#4+               SOLm7
Things will never be the same again
           MIb       SIb
It's not a secret anymore
          FA#4+          SOLm7
Now we've opened up the door
           MIb                 SIb
Starting tonight and from now on
             FA#4+               SOLm7
We'll never, never be the same again
 MIb                SIb
(Never be the same again)
FA#4+              SOLm7 
Never be the same again
 MIb                SIb 
(Never be the same again)
FA#4+              SOLm7 
Never be the same again
           MIb       SIb
It's not a secret anymore
          FA#4+          SOLm7
Now we've opened up the door
           MIb                 SIb
Starting tonight and from now on
             FA#4+               SOLm7
We'll never, never be the same again
 MIb                SIb
(Never be the same again)
FA#4+              SOLm7 
Never be the same again
 MIb                SIb 
(Never be the same again)
FA#4+              SOLm7 
Never be the same again
 MIb                SIb 
(Never be the same again)
FA#4+              
Never be the same again
