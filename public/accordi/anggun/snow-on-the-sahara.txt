 When you wander off out there

To those hills of dust and hard winds that blow

 In that dry white ocean alone

 The sun may blind our eyes,

I'll pray the skies above

 For snow to fall on the Sahara

where you can leave your doubts
SI                            DO#m7
 I'll hold you up and be your way out

 For snow to fall on the Sahara

Just a wish and I will cover your shoulders

With veils of silk and gold
         SOL/SI           SIm         LA4   LA
When the shadows come and darken your heart
