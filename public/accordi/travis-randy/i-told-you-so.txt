
   LA
Suppose I called you up tonight
    DO#m7
And told you that I love you
       RE            MI                LA
And suppose I said I want to come back home
       RE
And suppose I cried and said 
          LA      MI/SOL#    FA#m   MI
I think I finally learned my lesson
    SI7                           MI7/4    MI7
And I'm tired of spending all my time alone
     LA                              DO#m7
If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted
      RE               MI       LA
And it's killing me to be so far away
          RE
Would you tell my that you love me too
    LA       MI/SOL# FA#m  MI
And would we cry   together
   SI7                              MI7/4  MI7
Or would you simply laugh at me and say...

  RE/LA    LA    DO#m7    RE   MI/RE RE
I told you so, I told you so
  SIm7                                  MI
I told you some day you'd come crawling back
                          LA   MI
And asking me to take you in
  RE/LA    LA          DO#m7  RE   MI/RE RE
I told you so, but you had to go
         SIm7
Now I've found somebody new
             MI                           LA
And you will never break my heart in two again

RE/LA    MI

     LA
If I got down on my knees
             DO#m7
And told you I was yours forever
          RE                MI           LA
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand
         RE              
Would we get that old-time feeling
         LA        MI/SOL#  FA#m   MI
Would we laugh and talk for hours
    SI7                       MI7/4    MI7
The way we did when our love first began
          LA
Would you tell me that you've missed me too
    DO#m7
And that you've been so lonely
         RE               MI        LA
And you've waited for the day that I returned
         RE
And we'd live and love forever
           LA     MI/SOL# FA#m  MI
And that I'm your one and only
   SI7                              MI7/4  MI7
Or would you say the tables finally turned

And would you say...

  RE/LA    LA    DO#m7    RE   MI/RE RE
I told you so, I told you so
  SIm7                                  MI
I told you some day you'd come crawling back
                          LA   MI
And asking me to take you in
  RE/LA    LA          DO#m7  RE   MI/RE RE
I told you so, but you had to go
         SIm7
Now I've found somebody new
             MI                           LA
And you will never break my heart in two again
         SIm7
Now I've found somebody new
             MI                           LA
And you will never break my heart in two again

RE/LA   LA   MI LA
