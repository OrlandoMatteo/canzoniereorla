He wore starched white shirts buttoned at the neck,
         RE                             LA
and he'd sit in the shade and watch the chickens peck
        RE                   SOL
And his teeth were gone, but what the heck,
  RE           LA7        RE        SOL LA
I thought that he walked on water

   RE                   SOL
He said he was a cowboy when he was young
         RE                       LA7
He could handle a rope and he was good with a gun
       RE                    SOL
And my mama's daddy was his oldest son,
    RE             LA7          RE      
and I thought that he walked on water

               SOL               RE
If the story's told, only heaven knows
                      LA               RE   RE7
But his hat seemed to me like an old halo
                 SOL                    RE
And although his wings, they were never seen

I thought that he walked on water

     RE                    SOL
Then he tied a cord to the end of a mop,
           RE                  LA7
and said, "Son, here's a pony, keep her at a trot"
    RE                           SOL
And I'd ride in circles while he laughed alot
      RE      LA7      RE       LA/DO#   
Then I'd flop down beside him
           SIm                 LA
And he was ninety years old in sixty-three
    SOL             LA      
and I loved him and he loved me
    SOL               LA
And lord, I cried the day he died,
       RE             LA7        RE       
'cause I thought that he walked on water
