
   FA                             SIb
On one hand I count the reasons I could stay with you
    FA                             DO
And hold you close to me all night long
   FA                     SIb        
So many lovers' games I'd love to play with you
        SOL                             DO
On that hand there's no reason why it's wrong

           SIb                   FA
But on the other hand, there's a golden band
     DO                               FA
To remind me of someone who would not understand
   SIb                             FA
On one hand I could stay and be your lovin' man
        DO                         FA
But the reason I must go is on the other hand

        FA                         SIb
In your arms I feel the passion, I thought, had died
       FA                         DO
When I looked into your eyes, I found myself
         FA                          SIb
And when I first kissed your lips, I felt so alive
            SOL                           DO
I've got to hand it to you, girl, you're somethin' else

           SIb                   FA
But on the other hand, there's a golden band
     DO                               FA
To remind me of someone who would not understand
   SIb                             FA
On one hand I could stay and be your lovin' man
        DO                         FA
But the reason I must go is on the other hand
         DO                         FA
Yeah the reason I must go is on the other hand
