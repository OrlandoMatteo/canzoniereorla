The days of wine and roses were a long time ago
    SIbm                           LAb     SIbm
The proms, teenage crusin' and the picture show
    SIbm             LAb         SIbm
You tried so hard to fix your outsides
          SIbm                      LAb          SIbm
Until you realized that I took everything dear inside

             LAb
Give me your heart
             SIbm
Give me your soul
     SOLb
I'll take you when you're young
                  SIbm
The devil in miss Jones

     SIbm                     LAb             SIbm
Your daddy had a funny way of showing you his love.
       SIbm                           LAb      SIbm
It's a shame you've hid well from the Lord up above.
        SIbm                  LAb          SIbm
There's something inside that burns like a fire,
        SIbm                               LAb    SIbm
and you realize you've been blessed with a wild desire.

             LAb
Give me your heart
             SIbm
Give me your soul
     SOLb
I'll take you when you're young
                  SIbm
The devil in miss Jones

SIbm    LAb  SIbm

SIbm    LAb  SIbm

     SIbm                 LAb             SIbm
Your parochial background vanished in the wind
          SIbm                      LAb            SIbm
Perhaps a pornographic future and a million dollar friend
    SIbm             LAb           SIbm
you tried so hard to always be the one
     SIbm                  LAb          SIbm
Your loved by all men, but respected by none.

             LAb
Give me your heart
             SIbm
Give me your soul
     SOLb
I'll take you when you're young
                  SIbm
The devil in miss Jones
             LAb
Give me your heart
             SIbm
Give me your soul
     SOLb                                
I'll take you when you're young
                               SIbm
and I'll leave you when you're old.
