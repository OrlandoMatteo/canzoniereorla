LAm
All I'm looking for
     LAm/SOL
Is a little bit more rope
   FA
To wrap around my throat
                            SOLadd9
I'm in trouble I'm in trouble
    LAm
And all I'm gasping for
   LAm/SOL
Is one last breath of hope
   FA
To heal the hearts I broke
                            SOLadd9
I'm in trouble I'm in trouble
         LAm          LAm/SOL
When you lay my body down
         FA                  
When you throw me in the ground
               SOLadd9
Don't be sorry
         LAm          LAm/SOL
When you lay my body down
         FA                     SOLadd9
When you throw me in the ground

LAm
All the fearful eyes
     SOL
Stay burned upon my mind
    FA
The gift they left behind
                                 SOL
I'm all troubles I'm all troubles
LAm
Still they find the words
     SOL
Ring louder than my thoughts
    FA
Lay heavy as a curse
                             SOL
I'm in trouble I'm in trouble
         LAm          LAm/SOL
When you lay my body down

When you lay my body down

When I'm buried in the ground
