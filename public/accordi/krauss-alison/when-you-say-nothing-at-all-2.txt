 It's amazing how you 
           SIb         MIb  SIb  LAb  SIb
can speak right to my heart
MIb       SIb      LAb  
 Without saying a word 
        SIb           MIb  SIb  LAb  SIb
you can light up the dark
LAbadd9               SIbadd9       
Try as I may I could never explain 
MIb      SIb            LAb         SIb
 what I hear when you don't say a thing

    MIb             SIb
The smile on your face 
         LAb           SIb
lets me know that you need me
          MIb             SIb
There's a truth in your eyes 
        LAb           SIb
saying you'll never leave me
    MIb            SIb
The touch of your hand 
             LAb                SIb   LAb/DO SIb/RE
says you'll catch me if ever I fall
LAb            SIb 
You say it best 
                         MIb  SIb  LAb  SIb
when you say nothing at all

MIb  SIb  LAb  SIb

MIb       SIb        LAb  
 All day long I can hear 
        SIb         MIb  SIb  LAb  SIb
people talking out loud
MIb        SIb         LAb   
 But when you hold me near 
    SIb            MIb  SIb  LAb  SIb
you drown out the crowd
LAb                       SIb
Old Mister Webster could never define
MIb           SIb          LAb            SIb
What's being said between your heart and mine

    MIb             SIb
The smile on your face 
         LAb           SIb
