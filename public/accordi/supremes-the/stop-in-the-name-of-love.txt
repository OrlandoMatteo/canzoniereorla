 Baby, baby

I'm aware of where you go
              LA7
Each time you leave my door
FA7+              SOL6
 I watch you walk down the street
FA7+                SOL6
 Knowing your other love you'll meet

 Leaving me alone and hurt

 I've known of your
DO7+
Your secluded nights
SOLm7
 I've even seen her
LA7
Maybe once or twice
FA7+        SOL6
 But is her sweet expression
FA7+                SOL6
 Worth more than my love and affection?
DO                        SOL/SI
 But this time before you leave my arms

 I've tried so hard, hard to be patient
SOLm7               LA7
 Hoping you'll stop this infatuation
FA7+           SOL6
 But each time you are together

 I'm so afraid I'll be losing you forever
