 Up on a hill is where we begin
RE                 REadd9          
 This little story 
              SOL6  SOL  SOL6  SOL
a long time ago
RE               REadd9
 Stop to pretend, stop pretending
RE                          
 It seems this game 
          REadd9      SOL6  SOL  SOL6  SOL
is simply never-ending

           RE              REadd9
Oh, in the sun, sun having fun
                RE
It's in my blood
    
I just can't help it
      REadd9             
Don't want you here right now
    SOL6  SOL  
Let me go,  oh, let me g-g-g-g-g-g-go

             RE/FA#
Leavin' just in time
                 MIm
Stay there for a while
               FA#m
Rolling in the ocean
                LA
Trying to catch her eye
                  RE/FA#
Work hard and say it's easy
              MIm
Do it just to please me
                 FA#m
Tomorrow will be different
                 LA
So I'll pretend I'm leaving

              RE
Our fears are different here
            REadd9
We train in A-V-A
           RE
I wish you hadn't stayed
            REadd9                 
My vision's clearer now, 
           SOL6  SOL  SOL6  SOL
but I'm unafraid
RE                  REadd9
Flying overseas, no time to feel the breeze
RE               REadd9    SOL6  SOL  SOL6  SOL
 I took too many varieties
           RE              REadd9
Oh, in the sun, sun having fun

It's in my blood
RE     
 I just can't help it
      REadd9 
Don't want you here right now
    SOL6  SOL
Let me go ...Darling let me g-g-g-g-g-g-go
