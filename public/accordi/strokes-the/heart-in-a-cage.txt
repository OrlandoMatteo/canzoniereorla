        DOm    
Well, I don't feel better 
      LAb         MIb
when I'm fucking around
      DOm
And I don't write better 
       LAb            MIb
when I'm stuck in the ground
         DOm
So don't teach me a lesson 
        LAb         MIb
'cause I've already learned
          DOm
Yeah, the sun will be shining 
     LAb          MIb
and my children will burn
    DOm       LAb       MIb
Oh, the heart beats in its cage

DOm         LAb  FAm  DOm

        DOm      
I don't want what you want, 
    LAb               MIb
I don't feel what you feel
         DOm
See, I'm stuck in a city 
     LAb          MIb
but I belong in a field
             DOm
Yeah, we got left, left, left, left, 
LAb         MIb
left, left, left
         DOm
Now it's three in the morning 
     LAb           MIb
and you're eating alone
    DOm       LAb       MIb
Oh, the heart beats in its cage

DOm                      LAm7/5-      SOLm
All our friends, they're laughing at us
DOm              LAm7/5-      SOLm
All of those you loved, you mistrust
DOm               LAm7/5-       SOLm
Help me, I'm just not quite myself
DOm                  LAm7/5-    SOLm
Look around, there's no one else left

  DOm
I went to the concert 
     LAb                 MIb
and I fought through the crowd
        DOm
Guess I got too excited 
      LAb                MIb
when I thought you were around
            DOm
Oh, he gets left, left, left, left, 
LAb         MIb
left, left, left
        DOm
And I'm sorry you were thinking 
        LAb        MIb
I would steal your fire
        DOm   LAb          MIb   
Oh, the heart beats in its cage
         DOm   LAb        MIb
Yes, the heart beats in its cage...

DOm          

        DOm   LAb        MIb
And the heart beats in its cage
