
           SOLm                      MIb
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
                SIb
Well, that's alright, 
                          FA/LA
because I like the way it hurts
           SOLm                     MIb
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
                SIb
Well, that's alright, 
                           FA/LA
because I love the way you lie
                   SOLm
I love the way you lie

                         SOLm
I can't tell you what it really is
                  
I can only tell you what it feels like
MIbadd9
And right now, 

there's a steel knife in my windpipe
SIb
I can't breathe, 
 
but I still fight while I can fight
SIb/LA
As long as the wrong feels right, 

it's like I'm in flight
SOLm
 High off of love, drunk from her hate
                      MIbadd9
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her, 

the more I suffer
            SIb
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
                   SIb/LA
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me
                    SOLm
And I love it, "Wait

Where you going?" "I'm leaving you"
               MIbadd9
"No you ain't, come back"

We're running right back, here we go again
SIb
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, 

it's going great
SIb/LA
I'm Superman, 

with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
SOLm
But when it's bad, it's awful
                   MIbadd9
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, 

"Who's that dude?"
                            SIb
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her

I'll never stoop so low again, 
SIb/LA
I guess I don't know my own strength

           SOLm                      MIb
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
                SIb
Well, that's alright, 
                          FA/LA
because I like the way it hurts
           SOLm                     MIb
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
                SIb
Well, that's alright,

I love the way you lie

                  SOLm
You ever love somebody 
                     
so much you can barely breathe 
            
when you're with 'em?
    MIbadd9
You meet, and neither one of you, 

even know what hit 'em
         SIb
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah, 

them chills, used to get 'em
           SIb/LA
Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em
                 SOLm
You swore you've never hit 'em, 

never do nothing to hurt 'em
                           MIbadd9
Now you're in each other's face

Spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
    SIb
You push, pull each other's hair, 

scratch, claw, bit 'em
       SIb/LA
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, 
                    
so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
         SOLm          
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
                   MIbadd9
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
                                       SIb
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, 

that was yesterday
                          SIb/LA
Yesterday is over, it's a different day

Sound like broken records playin' over
        SOLm
But you promised her, 

next time you'll show restraint
               MIbadd9
You don't get another chance, 

life is no Nintendo game
              SIb
But you lied again

Now you get to watch her leave out the window
                      SIb/LA
Guess that's why they call it window pane

           SOLm                      MIb
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
                SIb
Well, that's alright, 
                          FA/LA
because I like the way it hurts
           SOLm                     MIb
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
                SIb
Well, that's alright, 
                           FA/LA
because I love the way you lie
                   SOLm   MIb
I love the way you lie
                   SIb   SIb/LA
I love the way you lie

              SOLm
Now I know we said things, 
                        
did things that we didn't mean
        MIbadd9
Then we fall back into the same patterns

Same routine, 
SIb
but your temper's just as bad as mine is
                       SIb/LA
You're the same as me, when it comes to love, 

you're just as blinded
             SOLm
Baby, please come back, it wasn't you

Baby, it was me, 
      MIbadd9
maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
      SIb
Maybe that's what happens 

when a tornado meets a volcano
SIb/LA
All I know is I love you too much 
                   SOLm
to walk away though

Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
MIbadd9
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
SIb
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
SIb/LA
Next time I'm pissed, 

I'll aim my fist at the drywall
SOLm
Next time? There won't be no next time
       MIbadd9
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
                 SIb
I'm tired of the games, 

I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
       SIb/LA
If she ever tries to fucking leave again

I'm a tie her to the bed 

and set this house on fire

           SOLm                      MIb
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
                SIb
Well, that's alright, 
                          FA/LA
because I like the way it hurts
           SOLm                     MIb
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
                SIb
Well, that's alright, 
                           FA/LA
because I love the way you lie
                   SOLm   MIb
I love the way you lie
                   SIb   SIb/LA
I love the way you lie
