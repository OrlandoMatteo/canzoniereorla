There's nothing that I can do
            LAm7
I've set my mind on you
           MIm7
the more I see that you're not real
             RE
the more I believe I feel
        DO7+
I gotta reach out to you
             LAm7
and hold you some day somehow
            MIm7
and when my love dreams come true
   RE
oh Lord
   DO7+                     LAm7
No matter what it takes, to be here
   MIm7
no fear that can't be one by love
          RE
if you believe it

Love is a temple
LAm7/9
don't take it for granted
MIm7
and when it happens
     RE                        DO7+
it's time to write your story

                 DO7+
I tried to break all the rules
             LAm7
and all I do hurts you soon
             MIm7  
but this time I'm close to you
          RE
girl, you slip away from me
     DO7+                              LAm7
I'll never get the chance to get here
       MIm7                         
you'll better make this rain on time
        RE
you and I
