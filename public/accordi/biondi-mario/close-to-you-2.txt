I know why do birds suddenly appear
      SIm7         MIm7
Every time you are near
DO7+/9        
Just like me, they long to be
SOL7+/9        
Close to you
       DO7+/9               FA#m7/5- SI7
Why do stars fall down from the  sky
      SIm7          MIm7
Every time you walk by
DO7+/9
Just like me, they long to be
SOL7+/9
Close to you
DO7+
On the day that you were born
DO7+/4+               DO6/9
 And the angels got together
      SIm7                    MI11     MI7
And decided to create a dream come true
 DO7+/9
So they sprinkled moon dust

In your hair of gold
                            RE7 
And starlight in your eyes of blue

            DO7+/9  FA#m7/5-   SI7
That is why all the girls in town
SIm7            MIm7
Follow you all around
DO7+/9                    
Just like me, they long to be
SOL7+/9
Close to you...
