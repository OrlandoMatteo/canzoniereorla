The clouds come-a creepin' and you got me weepin' this morning
                                               
I can't believe your really gonna leave this town
FAm7/9     SOL7/5+               DOm7/9  
  everyone knows, I can't make a move with you
LAb7+                   SOL7/5+   DOm7/9
  your turnin' my whole world, upside-down
FAm6          SOL7/9-           DOm7/9         FA9/6
  and I get a feelin' that I've seen the last of you,

DOm7/9                                               
  The salty air, your wind-blown hair, reflections of a dream
   
thoughts of you with who knows who,

flowin' through me like a stream
FAm7/9   FAm6   SOL7/5+ DOm7/9   
  Brazilian serenades, linger on
LAb7+          SOL7/5+     DOm7/9
  help me lose my soul, in your song
REm7/5- SOL7/9-                  DOm7/9         FA6/9
  and I get a feelin', that I've seen that last of you,

  Months go by, I wounder why, I'm left here on my own

could it be my destiny, to live my life alone
FA#m7/9 FA#m6      SOL#7/5+    DO#m7/9
  these dark and rainy days are turning cold
LA7+      SOL#7/5+       DO#m7/9   
  lonely sleepless nights, gettin' old
RE#m7/5-      SOL#7/9-    DO#m7/9         FA#6/9
  and I get a feelin' that I've seen the last of you
