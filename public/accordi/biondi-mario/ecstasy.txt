I'm in ecstasy   ...when you're missing me
          DOm7
When your heart wants mine
        MIb6/FA
There's no sense of time
         SIb
You're a song to me
         SOLm7/9
Sung so easily
        DOm7/4
Nothing more to say
      MIb/FA          SIb
Nothing else will do
      MIb7+             REm7
And I feel so blue In my solitude
     DOm7
As i lay awake
       MIb6/FA
In the night
       SIb    
I'm in ecstasy when you're
SOLm7
Reaching me
         DOm7
When our souls allign
           MIb/FA
There's no world sublime
          SIb
You're my harmony
        SOLm7/9
In this empty sea
     DOm7/4
Want you here inside
        MIb6/FA   FA
Can you hear me cry
         MIb7+
If you'd call my name
       REm7
You'd erase the pain
        DOm7
But all over again
     MIb6/FA
I'm alone
       SIb
I'm in ecstasy want you
SIb/LAb
Kissing me
