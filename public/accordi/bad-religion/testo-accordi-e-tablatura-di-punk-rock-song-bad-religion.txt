Have you been to the desert
         SI              FA#
have you walked with the dead?
          DO#m             MI
There's a hundred thousand children
      SI               SOL#
being killed for their bread
        LA
And the figures don't lie
              MI
they speak of human disease
       SI
But we do what we want
       MI            SI
and we think what we please
         DO#m          MI
Have you lived the experience

Have you witnessed the plague?
DO#m          MI
People making babies sometimes
SI       SOL#
just to escape
        LA
In this land of competition
       MI
the compassion is gone
       SI
Yet we ignore the needy
       MI           SI
and we keep pushing on
MI           SI
Keep pushing on

Written for the people
        MI              SOL#
who can see something's wrong
     LA
Like ants in a colony
   MI
we do our share
            SOL#
But there's so many other

fuckin' insects out there

Have you visited the quagmire
         SI          FA#
have you swam in the shit?
    DO#m     MI
The party conventions
        SI       SOL#
and the real politik
    LA
The faces always different
       MI
the rhetoric the same
       SI
But we swallow it all
           MI      SI
and we see nothing changed
MI          SI
Nothing has changed
