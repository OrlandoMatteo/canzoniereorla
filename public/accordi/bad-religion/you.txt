          LAm                         FA      
There's a place where everyone can be happy
              DO
It's the most beautiful place
                     SOL
in the whole fucking world
     LAm      
It's made of candy canes and planes
    FA
And bright red choo-choo trains
        DO
And the meanest little boys
             RE5             MI
and the most innocent little girls
        LAm                      FA  
And you know I wish that I could go there
       DO                   SOL
It's a road that I have not found
    LAm                    FA 
And I wish you the best of luck, dear
DO                         RE5        MI
Drop a card or a letter to my side of town
                FA
Because there's no time for fussing
    MI
and fighting my friend
    FA
But baby I'm amazed
       MI        FA      SOL
at the hate that you can send and
LAm FA SOL  LAm
You... 
                  FA     DO MI
painted my entire world
    LAm FA SOL
But I...     don't have the turpentine
   LAm                 FA   MI
to clean what you have soiled
                        LAm
And I won't forget it

          LAm                         FA
There's a place where everyone can be right
     DO                                   SOL
Even though you remain determined to be opposed
  LAm                         FA
Admittance requires no qualifications
           DO
It's where everyone has been
          RE5       MI
and where everybody goes
   LAm                    FA
So please try not to be impatient
       DO                   SOL
For we all hate standing in line
    LAm                    
And when the farm is good and bought
          FA
You'll be there without a thought
     DO
And eternity, my friend
     RE5          MI
is a long fucking time
                FA
Because there's no time for fussing
    MI
and fighting my friend
    FA
But baby I'm amazed
       MI        FA      SOL
at the hate that you can send and
LAm FA SOL LAm
You... 
                  FA     DO  MI
painted my entire world
    LAm FA SOL
But I...     don't have the turpentine
   LAm                 FA   MI
to clean what you have soiled
                       LAm FA SOL DO
And I won't forget it 

LAm FA SOL DO
