DO#
She
                            MIdim
May be the face I can' t forget
                        FA#
A trace of pleasure I regret
                          DO#             LA#7/RE
May be my treasure or the price I have to pay
RE#m                              FA#m/LA
  She may be the song that summer sings
                             DO#/SOL#
May be the chill that autumn brings
                         FA#
May be a hundred tearful things
           SOL#           DO# FA# SOL#4 SOL#
Within the measure of the day

DO#
She
                         MIdim
May be the beauty or the beast 
                         FA#
May be the famine or the feast 
                           DO#         LA#7/RE
May turn each day into heaven... or a hell 
RE#m                          FA#m/LA
  She may be the mirror of my dreams 
                       DO#/SOL#
A smile reflected in a stream 
                             RE#7/SOL
She may not be what she may seem 
  SOL#4 SOL# DO#
Inside  a    shell


LA
She
                               MI
who always seems so happy in a crowd 
                                    RE
Whose eyes can be so private and so proud 
                             DO#
No one's allowed to see them when they cry 


FA#m           SI                       MI
She may be the love that cannot hope to last 
            DO#                    RE#
May come to me from shadows of the past 
         RE#7                  SOL#  SOL#7
That I remember till the day I die 


DO#
She
                       MIdim
may be the reason I survive 
                           FA#
The why and wherefore I'm alive 
                                  DO#
The one I'll care for through the rough
          LA#7/RE
and rainy years
RE#m                                FA#m/LA
  Me I'll take her laughter and her tears 
                          DO#/SOL#
And make them all my souvenirs 
                            RE#/SOL
For where she goes I got to be 
            SOL#
The meaning of my life is ...

FA#    DO#/FA  RE#m7   DO#
  She, she....... mmh, she
