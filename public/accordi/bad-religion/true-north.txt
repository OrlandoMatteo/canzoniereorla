SOLm              MIb  FA RE
Unrepentant vagabond
SOLm                         MIb           FA RE
Plot the new coordinates and cast the map aside
SOLm                MIb  FA RE
Now I gotta ramble on
SOLm                      MIb               FA RE
Navigate the pitfalls and cross the great divide
    MIb                      FA
The mapmaker's legend gave direction and a key
   MIb                          RE
He set the declination but what good is it to me?

SOLm              MIb
I can't see the rationality
    SIb                    FA
The world's not my responsibility
    SOLm            MIb
And happiness isn't there for me
    SIb                           RE
But maybe I'll inch closer to the source

When I find true north...
 SIb       FA      SOLm  MIb
(With or without a friend 
SIb             FA      SOLm  
keep searching 'til the end)

Tempting fate and cheating death
SOLm                       MIb              FA RE
No one ever told me it was going to be like this

Contemplate the randomness
SOLm                             
When the mind is willing 
        MIb           FA RE5
it gets downright perilous
MIb                               FA
Overburdened, underwhelmed, their ethical decree
MIb/SOL
That's your moral compass 
         RE
but what good is it to me?

SOLm              MIb
I can't see the rationality
    SIb                    FA
The world's not my responsibility

SIb    FA        SOLm
When I find true north
