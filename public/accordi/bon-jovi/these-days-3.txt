I was walking around
       REadd9
Just a face in the crowd
      MIm9                        
Tryna keep myself out of the rain
RE    DOadd9
Saw a vagabond king
REadd9
Wear a Styrofoam crown
         MIm9
Wondered if I might end up the same
RE        DOadd9         REadd9
There's a man out on the corner
MIm9               DOadd9       
Singing old songs about change
                     REadd9            SOL
Everybody's got their cross to bear these days
         DOadd9           REadd9
She came looking for some shelter
       MIm9
With a suitcase full of dreams
RE   DOadd9               REadd9
To a motel room on the boulevard
              MIm9   
I guess she's tryna be James Dean
      DOadd9         REadd9     
She's seen all the disciples 
    MIm9          DOadd9
and all the wanna-bes
                RE                  MIm
No one wants to be themselves these days

Jimmy Shoes busted both his legs
MIm9
Tryna learn to fly
RE     DOadd9       REadd9
From a second story window
        MIm9                  
He just jumped and closed his eyes
    DOadd9            REadd9
His momma said he was crazy
          MIm9              DOadd9
He said, "Momma, I've gotta try
                    RE            MIm
Don't you know that all my heroes died?
      DOadd9            REadd9        SOL
And I guess I'd rather die than fade away"
