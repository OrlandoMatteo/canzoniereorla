 this romeo is bleeding
SI
 but you can't see his blood

 it's nothing but some feelings
          SOL#m
that this old dog kicked up
DO#m
 it's been raining since you left me
        SI
now I'm drowning in the flood
LA
you see I've always been a fighter
       SOL#m           LA  SI
but without you I give up
DO#m
now I can't sing a love song
         SI/RE#
like the way it's meant to be
        LA/MI
well, I guess I'm not that good anymore

till the heavens burst and
    LA
the words don't rhyme

           DO#m
now you're pictures that you left behind
         SI
are just memories of a different life
          LA
some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
         SOL#m         
one that made you have to say goodbye
         DO#m
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
SI                   
 to touch your lips, to hold you near
         LA
when you say your prayers try to understand
     SOL#m              LA     SI        
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
        DO#m
when he holds you close, when he pulls you near
        SI/RE#                 
when he says the words you've been needing to hear
          LA/MI
I'll wish I was him `cause those words are mine
   SI/FA#              LA     SI            
to say to you till the end of time

 if you told me to cry for you
        RE
I could
                  SOL      LA4 LA              
if you told me to die for you
      SIm

take a look at my face
