LA
 As I sit in this smokey room
DO#m
 The night about to end
SOL
 I pass my time with strangers
         RE
But this bottle's my only friend
LA
 Remember when we used to park
  DO#m
On Butler Street out in the dark
SOL
 Remember when we lost the keys
   RE
And you lost more than that in my backseat
LA
 Remember how we used to talk
     DO#m
About busting out, we'd break their hearts
  SOL RE/FA#    SOL RE
Toge--ther,   fore--ver

      LA                 DO#m
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
RE     
You and me and my old friends
REm                   
Hoping it would never end

LA
 Remember days of skipping school
DO#m
Racing cars and being cool
       SOL
With a six pack and the radio
  RE
We didn't need no place to go
LA
 Remember at the prom that night
DO#m
You and me we had a fight
        SOL    
But the band they played our favorite song
     RE
And I held you in my arms so strong

   LA
We danced so close

We danced so slow
      DO#m
And I swore I'd never let you go
