 Hello again, it's you and me
SOL/SI
 Kinda always like it used to be
MIm
 Sippin' wine, killing time
FA
 Trying to solve life's mysteries
DO
 How's your life, it's been a while?
SOL/SI
 God it's good to see you smile
MIm
 I see you reaching for your keys
FA                        
Looking for a reason not to leave
       DO         SOL
If you don't know if you should stay
        LAm      FA
If you don't say what's on your mind
      DO
Baby just breathe
        MIm                          FA
There's nowhere else tonight we should be
                 DO      
You wanna make a memory

DO
 I dug up this old photograph
SOL/SI
 Look at all that hair we had
MIm
 It's bitter sweet to hear you laugh
FA
 Your phone is ringin' I don't wanna ask
       DO     SOL
If you go now I'll understand
       LAm        FA
If you stay, hey, I've gotta plan
                 DO      SOL/SI
You wanna make a memory?
                  LAm             FAadd9
You wanna steal a piece of time?
                 DO         SOL/SI
You can sing the melody to me
                  LAm          FAadd9
And I can write a couple lines
                 DO     SOL/SI   LAm   FAadd9
You wanna make a memory

       DO         SOL
If you don't know if you should stay
        LAm       FA
And you don't say what's on your mind
     DO
Baby just breathe
        MIm
There's nowhere else tonight 
      FA
we should be (We should be)

(We should be)

                 DO     SOL/SI
You wanna make a memory?
