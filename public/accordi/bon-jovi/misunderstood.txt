 Should I? Could I?

Have said the wrong things right a thousand times
                  SOL/SI               LA7/4
If I could just rewind, I see it in my mind
                                           SOL
If I could turn back time, you'd still be mine

You cried, I died
                      SOL/RE                  DOadd9
I should have shut my mouth, things headed south
                            SOL/SI
As the words slipped off my tongue, 
                LA7/4
they sounded dumb

If this old heart could talk, 
                     LAm7            
it'd say you're the one
                DO
I'm wasting time when I think about it

 I----I should have drove all night,
                         RE/FA#
I would have run all the lights
              MIm7
I was misunderstood
     DOadd9             SOL
I----I stumbled like my words,

Did the best I could

Damn, misunderstood

Apologize for sleeping on the couch that night
                          SOL/SI        
Staying out too late with all my friends
LA7/4
 You found me passed out in the yard again
SOL       SOL/FA#  MIm7
 You cried, I tried
                          SOL/RE     LAm7
To stretch the truth, but didn't lie
               DO        
It's not so bad when you think about it
