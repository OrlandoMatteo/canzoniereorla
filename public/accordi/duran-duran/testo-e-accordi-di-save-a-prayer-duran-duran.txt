  You saw me standing by the wall...
SOL         FA
corner of a main street
REm       FA/DO
  And the lights are flashing
SIb7+          SOL   DO
on your window sill
REm    FA/DO           SIb7+
  All alone ain't much fun,
          SOL     FA      REm
So you're looking for the thrill
        FA/DO             SIb7+
And you know just what it takes
               SOL   DO
and where to go!


SIm     RE7+                SOL
  Don't say a prayer for me now
FA#m             LA      SIm
Save it 'til the morning after
          RE7+                SOL
No, don't say a prayer for me now
FA#m             LA      REm
Save it 'til the morning after!

  Feel the breeze deep on the inside
         SOL    FA      REm
Look you down into your well
       FA/DO               SIb7+
If you can, you'll see the world
           SOL   DO
in all his fire
REm      FA/DO            SIb7+
  Take a chance, like all dreamers
      SOL     FA    REm
can't find no other way
          FA/DO            SIb7+
You don't have to dream it all
            SOL   DO
just live a day!

  Pretty looking road,
         SIb7+           SOL
I try to hold the rising floods
     FA      REm
that fill my skin
             FA/DO             SIb7+
Don't ask me why, I'll keep my promise
         SOL   DO
melt the ice
REm       FA/DO                 SIb7+
  And you wanted to dance, so I asked you to dance
    SOL     FA      REm
But fear is in your soul
            FA/DO               SIb7+
Some people call it a one night stand
           SOL         DO
But we can call it paradise!
