Wild boys...

    MIm
The wild boys are calling
         SIm
On their way back from the fire
   MIm
In August moon's surrender to
  SIm
A dust cloud on the rise
DO                LA7
 Wild boys fallen far from glory
MIm 
Reckless and so hungered
       SIm           
On the razors edge you trail
                MIm
Because there's murder by the roadside
     SIm
In a sore afraid new world
DO             RE
 They tried to break us
      DO                LA
Looks like they'll try again

        MIm 
You got sirens for a welcome
        SIm
There's bloodstain for your pain
         MIm
And your telephone been ringing
             SIm
While you're dancing in the rain
DO               LA
Wild boys wonder where is glory
MIm
Where is all you angels
        SIm
Now the figureheads of have fell
    MIm
And lovers war with arrows
     SIm
Over secrets they could tell
DO             RE             DO                LA
 They tried to tame you looks like they'll try again
