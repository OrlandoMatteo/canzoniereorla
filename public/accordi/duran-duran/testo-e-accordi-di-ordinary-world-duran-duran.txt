DO#m7
Came in from a rainy thursday
MI            FA#4
on the avenue
DO#m7                              MI   FA#4
 thought I heard you talking softly
DO#m7
 I turned on the lights, the tv
MI           FA#4
and the radio
DO#m7                              MI   FA#4
 still I can't escape the ghost of you
DO#m7
 What is happened to it all?
SOL#m9
Crazy, some say
RE#7                         MI   
Where is the life that I recognize? Gone away

SI                          FA#m7
  But I won't cry for yesterday
                    REadd9
there's an ordinary world
        LA/DO#    MIadd9
somehow I have to find
SI                        FA#m7
  And as I try to make my way
                REadd9
to the ordinary world
       LA/DO#      DO6
I will learn to survive

DO#m7     FA#7/DO#

DO#m7
Passion or coincidence
     MI                  FA#4
once prompted you to say
DO#m7                          MI   FA#4
 "Pride will tear us both apart"
         DO#m7
Well now pride's gone out the window
          MI            FA#4
cross the rooftops, runaway
DO#m7                         MI    FA#4
  left me in the vacuum of my heart
DO#m7
What is happening to me?
SOL#m9
Crazy, some say
RE#7                           MI         
Where is my friend when I need you most? Gone away

SI                          FA#m7
  But I won't cry for yesterday
                    REadd9
there's an ordinary world
        LA/DO#    MIadd9

  And as I try to make my way
                REadd9
to the ordinary world
       LA/DO#      MIadd9
I will learn to survive

SI  FA#m7  REadd9  LA/DO#  MI

SI  FA#m7  REadd9  LA/DO#  DO6

DO#m7                           MI               FA#4
 Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed
DO#m7                       MI   FA#4
 Fear today, forgot tomorrow
DO#m7                      MI           FA#4
  Besides the news of holy war and holy need
DO#m7                           MI   FA#4
 Ours is just a little sorrowed talk

SI                          FA#m7
  But I won't cry for yesterday

      SI    FA#m7       REadd9
Every world...... is my world
        LA/DO#      MI7
(I will learn to survive)
    SI    FA#m7       REadd9
Any world...... is my world

Any world...... is my world...
