DOm     SIb6      SIb       LAb6       LAb
Mine, immaculate dream made breath and skin
          SIb
I've been waiting for you
DOm           SIb6    SIb
Signed with a home tattoo,
      LAb6        LAb        SIb
Happy Birthday to You was created for you
DOm                               SIb4    SIb
Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams
LAb                                  SIb
Can't I believe you're taking my heart to pieces
DOm       SIb6          SIb
Oh, it'll take a little time,
      LAb6          LAb
Might take a little crime
   SIb
To come undone now
LAb   
We'll try to stay blind
SOL4            SOL
To the hope and fear outside
FAm7             SIb9   SOLm7
Hey, child, stay wilder than the wind
    SIb           DOm
And blow me in to cry

MIb              LAb
Who do you need, who do you love
SIb              DOm
 When you come undone?
MIb              LAb
Who do you need, who do you love
SIb              DOm
 When you come undone?

DOm            SIb6    SIb
Words, playing me deja vu
       LAb6   LAb   SIb
Like a radio tune I swear I've heard before
DOm       SIb6         SIb
Chill, is it something real
       LAb6       LAb    SIb
Or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers?
DOm                               SIb4      SIb
Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams
LAb                                SIb
Can I believe you're taking my heart to pieces?
DOm       SIb6        SIb
Lost in a snow filled sky,
      LAb6      LAb
We'll make it alright
   SIb
To come undone now
LAb
We'll try to stay blind
SOL4            SOL
To the hope and fear outside
FAm7             SIb9   SOLm
Hey, child, stay wilder than the wind
    SIb           DOm
And blow me in to cry...

MIb              LAb
Who do you need, who do you love
SIb              DOm
 When you come undone?
MIb              LAb
Who do you need, who do you love
SIb              DOm
 When you come undone?

(Can't ever keep from falling apart)
MIb              LAb
Who do you need, who do you love
SIb              DOm
 When you come undone?

(Can't ever keep from falling apart)
LAb            SIb          DOm
Who do you need, who do you love?
                                      MIb
(Can't ever keep from falling apart)
           LAb    SIb
Who do you love
                DOm
When you come undone?
