LAb
Why do they gotta front?
FAm                              MIb/SOL

LAb
I know that you need help
FAm                                      MIb/SOL
Your tongue is twisted, your eyes are slit
LAb
You need a guardian
REb              DOm      FAm

Bang, bang a knock on the door

Another big bang and you're down on the floor
LAb    FAm
Oh no! What do we do?

Don't look now but I lost my shoe
LAb             FAm
I can't run and I can't kick

What's the matter babe are you feeling sick?
LAb                                   FAm
What's the matter, what's the matter, what's the matter you?
