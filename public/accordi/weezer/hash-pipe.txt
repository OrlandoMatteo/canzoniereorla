LAm

LAm
I can't help my feelings

I'll go out of my mind

These players out to get me

'Cause they like my behind

I can't love my business

If I can't get a trick
                                           
Down on Santa Monica where tricks are for kids
RE5
Oh
                   LAm
Come on and kick me
RE5
Oh
                   FA
Come on and kick me (Whoa, whoa)
                   MI
Come on and kick me (Whoa, whoa)
                       RE5
You've got your problems (Whoa, whoa)
                     LAm
I've got my eyes wide

  LAm
I can't help my boogies

They get out of control

I know that you don't care

But I want you to know

The knee-stocking flavor is the favorite treat

Of men that don't bother with the taste of a teat
RE5
Oh
                   LAm
Come on and kick me
RE5
Oh

Come on and kick me (Whoa, whoa)
                   MI
Come on and kick me (Whoa, whoa)
                     RE5
You got your problems (Whoa, whoa)
                 DO
I got my eyes wide (Whoa, whoa)
                    SI
You've got your big Gs
                     LAm
I've got my hash pipe


RE5
Oh
                   LAm
Come on and kick me

I've got my eyes wide (Whoa, whoa)
                      SI
You've got your big Gs
                     LAm
I've got my hash pipe

Oh, I've got my hash pipe

Uh...

And I've got my hash pipe
