LA     RE LA    RE DO   SOL

LA     RE LA    RE 

LA
 I've looked under chairs

I've looked under tables

I've tried to find the key
                     
To fifty million fables
                 RE     DO RE
They call me The Seeker
                            LA    RE LA   
I've been searching low and high
DO
 I won't get to get what I'm after
SOL             LA     RE LA   
 Till the day I die

LA
 I asked Bobby Dylan
             
I asked The Beatles

I asked Timothy Leary

But he couldn't help me either
                 RE      DO RE
They call me The Seeker
                            LA     RE LA
I've been searching low and high
DO
 I won't get to get what I'm after
SOL               LA    RE LA    
 Till the day I die

RE
 People tend to hate me
                   
'Cause I never smile
     LA
As I ransack their homes
                            
They want to shake my hand
RE                   SOL
 Focusing on nowhere
  RE                 SOL
Investigating miles
      MI
I'm a seeker
 
LA    RE LA    RE LA     RE LA

RE       LA    RE LA     

DO
 I'm a really desperate man

I won't get to get what I'm after
SOL             LA    RE LA
 Till the day I die
RE                         SOL      RE
 I learned how to raise my voice in anger
          LA                     RE     LA
Yeah, but look at my face, ain't this a smile?
    RE                     SOL
I'm happy when life's good
    RE
And when it's bad I cry
         MI
I've got values but I don't know how or why

LA
 I'm looking for me
                       RE
You're looking for you
      LA
We're looking in at other
   
And we don't know what to do
                 RE      DO RE
They call me The Seeker
                            LA    RE LA
I've been searching low and high
DO
 I won't get to get what I'm after
SOL                LA    RE LA    
 Till the day I die
DO
 I won't get to get what I'm after
SOL               LA    RE DO  SOL  LA
 Till the day I die
