MIm                    SOL  
No one knows what it's like   
          RE     RE4
to be the bad man
          DOadd9 
to be the sad man
  LA2 
behind blue eyes

MIm                    SOL
No one knows what it's like  
      RE    RE4
to be hated
      DOadd9 
to be fated
   LA2 
to telling only lies

       DO     RE  
But my dreams  
               SOL
they aren't as empty
      DO         RE       MI
as my conscience seems to be   
       SI2         DO  
I have hours, only lonely     
              RE     RE4
my love is vengeance
            LA2 
thats never free

MIm                    SOL
No one knows what it's like   
              RE      RE4
to feel these feelings
       DOadd9 
like I do
            LA2 
and I blame you

MIm                  SOL
No one bites back as hard    
         RE    RE4
on their anger
           DOadd9 
none of my pain and woe
           LA2 
can show through

       DO     RE  
But my dreams  
               SOL
they aren't as empty
      DO         RE       MI
as my conscience seems to be   
       SI2         DO  
I have hours, only lonely     
              RE     RE4
my love is vengeance
            LA2 
thats never free

  When my fist clenches, crack it open  
MI         SIm        SOL      RE 
  Before I use it and loose my cool   
       SI2    LA           RE 
When I smile, tell me some bad news   
         SIm       LA         MI    SIm  LA
Before I laugh and act like a fool  
MI         SI2     LA       MI
  And if I swallow anything evil   
         SIm    SOL     RE
Put your finger down my throat  
         SI2            LA        RE
And if I shiver, please give me a blanket
        SIm          LA        MI
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat
