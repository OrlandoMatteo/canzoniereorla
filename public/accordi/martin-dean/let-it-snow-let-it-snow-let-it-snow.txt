Oh, the weather outside is frightful
        MIbm7   MIb7  LAb7
But the fire is so delightful
    SIb7                    MIbm7
And since we've no place to go
                    LAb7         REb
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

LAb7/6          REb
Man, It doesn't show signs of stopping
      FAm7        MIb7      MIbm7   LAb7
And I brought some corn for popping
    MIbm7      SIb7            MIbm7
The lights are turned way down low
       LAb7         REb
Let it snow, let it snow


        LAb                      LAdim
When we finally kiss good-night
    SIbm7           MIb7       LAb
How I'll hate going out in the storm
                          DOm7    FA7
But if you really hold me tight
SIb7        MIb7         LAb7  LAb7/6
All the way home I'll be warm


    REb
The fire is slowly dying
        MIbm7       MIb7       LAb
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing
       MIbm7       SIb7    MIbm7
But as long as you love me so
                    LAb7         REb
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
