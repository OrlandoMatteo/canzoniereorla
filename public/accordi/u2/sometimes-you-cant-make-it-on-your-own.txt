LA
Tough
    LA/SOL
You think you've got the stuff
       FA#m7          RE
You're telling me and anyone
       LA
You're hard enough
                             
You don't have to put up a fight
    LA/SOL
You don't have to always be right
FA#m7                    RE
 Let me take some of the punches
    LA
For you tonight

                   FA#m7
I need to let you know

You don't have to go it alone
         FA#m                     MI
And it's you when I look in the mirror
         RE7+                        
And it's you when I don't pick up the phone
FA#m7               MI              RE7+
Sometimes you can't make it on your own

   LA            LA/SOL
We fight all the time
        FA#m7       RE
You and I, that's alright
          LA
We're the same soul
                      LA/SOL
I don't need, I don't need to hear you say
           FA#m7       RE
That if we weren't so alike
               LA
You'd like me a whole lot more

You don't have to go it alone
         FA#m                     MI
And it's you when I look in the mirror
         RE7+            
And it's you when I don't pick up the phone
  FA#m              MI              RE7+
Sometimes you can't make it on your own

FA DO    LAm
     I'm sick of it all
FA DO    REm              
     Can you hear me 

       LA
when I sing?
       FA#m7
You're the reason I sing
RE                MI      LA
You're the reason why the opera is in me
REadd9
Hey now
                     LA
Still got to let you know
                       FA#m
A house doesn't make a home
                     REadd9
Don't leave me here alone
         FA#m7                    MI
And it's you when I look in the mirror
         RE
And it's you that makes it hard to let go
FA#m7               MI              RE
Sometimes you can't make it on your own
FA#m7               MI
Sometimes you can't make it
           RE            
Best you can do, is to fake it
FA#m7               MI        RE
Sometimes you can't make it on your own
