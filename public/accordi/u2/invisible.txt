 It's like the room just cleared of smoke
                                 LAb
I didn't even want the heart you broke

It's yours to keep
                       MIb
You just might need one
               
I finally found my real name
                               LAb
I won't be me when you see me again
    FAm7          LAb
No, I won't be my father's son

FAm7                LAb
 I'm more than you know
                       SOLm7
I'm more than you see here

More than you let me be
    MIb             FAm7
I'm more than you know
             LAb
A body in a soul
           SOLm7
You don't see me but you will
      LAb
I am not invisible

MIb
 I don't dream, not as such
                                  LAb
I don't even think about you that much
                              MIb
Unless I start to think at all
              
All those frozen days
                 LAb
And your frozen ways
              FAm7           LAb
They melt away your face like snow

FAm7                LAb
 I'm more than you know
                       SOLm7
I'm more than you see here

More than you let me be
    MIb             FAm7
I'm more than you know
             LAb
A body in a soul
           SOLm7
You don't see me but you will
      LAb
I am not invisible
      DOm  FA  MIb  SIb
I am here

            MIb
There is no them
            
There is no them
        FAm
There's only us
        
There's only us
            MIb
There is no them
            
There is no them
        FAm
There's only us
         
There's only us
            MIb
There is no them

There is no them
        FAm
There's only you
            
And there's only me
            MIb
There is no them
