Johnny take a walk with your sister the moon
        SIb              FA             
Let her pale light in to fill up your room
            SIb 
You've been living underground
 MIb
Eating from a can
            SIb
You've been running away
              FA       SIb
From what you don't understand...
      SIb
Love
             MIb
She's slippy
                    SIb
You're sliding down
                        MIb
She'll be there when you hit the ground
SIb                    MIb
 It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
REb             LAb             SIb
 She moves in mysterious ways
                       MIb
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
REb             LAb            SIb
 She moves in mysterious ways

SIb                          MIb
Johnny take a dive with your sister in the rain
        SIb                       FA
Let her talk about the things you can't explain
    SIb
To touch is to heal
    MIb
To hurt is to steal
       SIb
If you want to kiss the sky
       FA           SIb
Better learn how to kneel
                 
(on your knees boy)
                 MIb             
She's the wave
                   SIb
She turns the tide
                          MIb      SIb
She sees the man inside the child
                     MIb
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
REb             LAb            SIb
 She moves in mysterious ways
                      MIb
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
REb             LAb            SIb  
 She moves in mysterious ways
                     MIb
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
REb            LAb                 FAm
 Lift my days, light up my nights

SIb/FA   SIb/MIb  


REb6               MIb
 One day you will look...back
            REb
And you'll see...where
          LAb
You were held...how
         SIb
By this love...while
           MIb
You could stand...there
          REb
You could move on this moment
LAb                    SIb
Follow this feeling


                       MIb
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
REb             LAb           SIb

It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
REb             LAb           SIb
 She moves in mysterious ways
                      MIb
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
REb              LAb          SIb     MIb    
 We move through miracle days
REb              LAb
 Spirit moves in mysterious ways
SIb
 She moves with it
MIb
 She moves with it
REb            LAb                SIb
 Lift my days, light up my nights
