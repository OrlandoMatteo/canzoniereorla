                Oh, oh, magnificent

FA#m    DO#m  LA    MI       SI          SIm
  I was born,  I was born to be with you
                  FA#m        DO#m
In this space and time, after that
LA        MI              SI         SIm
 and ever after I haven't had a clue
              FA#m               DO#m
Only to break rhyme, this foolishness
LA           MI    SI             SIm
 can leave a heart black and blue

Oh, oh

FA#m   DO#m
  Only love
LA     MI      SI                SIm

  But only love
LA     MI      SI               SIm
 only love can heal such a scar

 I was born to sing for you
                FA#m               DO#m             
I didnâ€™t have a choice but to lift you up
LA           MI             SI           SIm
 and sing whatever song you wanted me to
                   FA#m            DO#m 
I give you back my voice, from the womb,  
LA            MI              SI     SIm
my first cry, it was a joyful noise   ...Oh, oh

FA#m   DO#m
  Only love
LA     MI      SI                SIm
 only love can leave such a mark

  But only love
LA     MI      SI               SIm
 only love can heal such a scar
FA#m   DO#m                      
  Justified till we die, you and 
LA              MI          SI        RE
I will magnify, oh-oh-oh, magnificent
