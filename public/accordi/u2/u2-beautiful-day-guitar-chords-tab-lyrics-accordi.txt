The heart is a bloom
SOL      RE               LA
  Shoots up through the stony ground
           LA  SIm RE
There's no room
SOL  RE                 LA
  No space to rent in this town
              LA  SIm RE
You're out of luck

You thought you'd found a friend
SOL           RE          LA
  To take you out of this place
        LA  SIm    RE
Someone you could lend
 SOL           RE       LA
a hand... in return for grace

You're on the road
SOL          RE          LA
  But you've got no destination
              LA SIm RE
You're in the mud
SOL      RE               LA
  In the maze of her imagination
