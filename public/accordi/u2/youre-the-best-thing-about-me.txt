FA                          REm
 I wish I found some better sounds

No one's ever heard
LAm
 I wish I had a better voice
    
That sang some better words
FA 
 I wish I found some chords
REm
In an order that is new
LAm
 I wish I didn't have to rhyme

Every time I sang
FA                     REm
 I was told when I get older

All my fears would shrink
    LAm
But now I'm insecure

And I care what people think
          FA             REm             LAm
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
          FA             REm             LAm
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

FA             MIm        
 Wish we could turn back time
LAm     MI         FA
 To the good old days
         SOL        DO
When our momma sang us to sleep
    MIm                 LAm
But now we're stressed out

                FA  REm  LAm
We're stressed out

LAm                       
 Sometimes a certain smell will
SOL
Take me back to when I was young
REm                          DO
 How come I'm never able to identify

Where it's coming from?
LAm
 I'd make a candle out of it
SOL
If I ever found it
       REm           
Try to sell it, never sell out of it
    DO
I'd probably only sell one
LAm                              SOL
 It'd be to my brother, cause we have the same nose
     REm
Same clothes, home grown
            DO
The stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
FA                     
 But it would remind us of when
REm
Nothing really mattered
       LAm                         
Out of student loans and tree house homes

We all would take the latter
          FA             REm             LAm
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
          FA             REm             LAm

LAm
Used to play pretend
          SOL
Give each other different names
         DO
We would build a rocket ship 
              MI
and then we'd fly it far away
        LAm
Used to dream of outer space
                SOL
But now they're laughing at our face singing
 DO
"Wake up, you need to make money", yeah
