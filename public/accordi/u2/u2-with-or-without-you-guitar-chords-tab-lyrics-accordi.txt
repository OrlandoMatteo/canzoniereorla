 See the stone set in your eyes         
        SOL                 RE
See the thorn twist in your side
         LA      SIm   SOL
And I'll wait for you
RE          LA                SIm
 Sleight of hand and twist of fate

With or without you, with or without you

 Through the storm we reach the shore
            SOL            RE
You give it all but I want more
        LA      SIm     SOL
And I'm waiting for you

SOL       RE   LA            SIm     SOL
  I can't live   with or without you

 My hands are tied,

nothing to win, and nothing left to lose
