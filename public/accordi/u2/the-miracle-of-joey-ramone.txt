      LAm              DO6      
I was chasing down the days of fear
SOL                            FA
Chasing down a dream before it disappeared
      LAm          DO6
I was aching to be somewhere near
     SOL             FA
Your voice was all I heard
      LAm            DO6
I was shaking from a storm in me
SOL                             FA
Haunted by the spectres that we had to see
        LAm              DO6
Yeah, I wanted to be the melody
          SOL              FA
Above the noise, above the hurt
      LAm        DO6
I was young, not dumb
     SOL           FA
Just wishing to be blinded
   LAm        DO6
By you, brand new
            RE                    LAm       
And we were pilgrims on our way


  SOL            RE
I woke up at the moment
         SIm      LA
When the miracle occurred
        SOL                 RE
Heard a song that made some sense
           LA
Out of the world
SOL          RE
Everything I ever lost
SIm            LA
Now has been returned
            SOL       RE             LA
In the most beautiful sound I'd ever heard

 
LA5  DO5  SOL5  FA5  LA5  DO5  SOL5    FA5

       LAm                    DO6
We got language so we can't communicate
  SOL             FA
Religion so I can love and hate
LAm             DO6          SOL   
Music so I can exaggerate my pain
    FA
And give it a name
      LAm        DO6
I was young, not dumb
     SOL           FA
Just wishing to be blinded
MI5 LAm        DO6
 By you, brand new
            RE                   LAm
And we were pilgrims on our way


  SOL            RE
I woke up at the moment
         SIm      LA
When the miracle occurred
        SOL                 RE
Heard a song that made some sense
           LA
Out of the world
SOL          RE
Everything I ever lost
SIm            LA
Now has been returned
            SOL       RE             LA
In the most beautiful sound I'd ever heard


       LAm       DO6      
We can hear you, hear you
       LAm  DO6    
We can year you
       LAm       DO6      SOL  FA
We can hear you, hear you

  SOL            RE     
I woke up at the moment
         SIm      LA
When the miracle occurred
  SOL         RE               LA
I get so many things I don't deserve
SOL            RE
All the stolen voices
     SIm          LA
Will someday be returned
         SOL       RE             LA
The most beautiful sound I'd ever heard


LA5  DO5  SOL5  

     FA5            LA5   DO5  SOL5
Your voices will be heard
            FA5     LA5      
Your voices will be heard...
