MI  LA  MI  MI4

MI       LA           MI   LA
Something is about to give
              MI     LA
I can feel it coming
                       MI    LA
I think I know what it means
                  MI   LA
I'm not afraid to die
                  MI    LA
I'm not afraid to live
             MI           LA
And when I'm flat on my back
                      MI   MI4
I hope to feel like I did
    LA          
And hardness, it sets in
                 DO#m
You need some protection
                LA
The thinner the skin

MI              LA
 I want you to know
     DO#m                  LAadd9
That you don't need me anymore
MI             LA
 I want you to know
               DO#m                  LAadd9
You don't need anyone or anything at all
MI                                    
Who's to say where the wind will take you?
SI
Who's to say what it is will break you?
LA                         
I don't know which way the wind will blow
MI                                
Who's to know when the time's come around?
SI                      LA
 Don't want to see you cry
                             MI  LA  MI  LA
I know that this is not goodbye

MI  LA  MI  MI4

   MI                      LA
In summer, I can taste the salt in the sea
          MI                     LA
There's a kite blowing out of control on a breeze
  MI                  LA
I wonder what's gonna happen to you
    MI                          MI4     
You wonder what has happened to me...

LA    DO#m  LA

      MI   SI           LA
I'm a ma---n, I'm not a child
  MI      SI
A man who sees
    LA           
The shadow behind your eyes
MI                               
Who's to say where the wind will take you?
SI                               
Who's to say what it is will break you?
LA            
I don't know where the wind will blow
MI
Who's to know when the time's come around
SI                      LA
 Don't want to see you cry
                              MI  LA  MI  LA
I know that this is not goodbye

      MI       LA
Did I waste it?
                       MI      LA
Not so much I couldn't taste it
               MI
Life should be fragrant
LA              LA
 Rooftop to the basement
                MI       LA
The last of the rockstars
                       MI      LA
When hip-hop drove the big cars
                     MI    LA
In the time when new media
            MI   LA
Was the big idea
                 MI  LA  MI  LA  MI
That was the big idea
