 We turn away to face the cold

Enduring chill

As the day begs the night

For mercy love

The sun so bright
             FA/DO
It leaves no shadows
            SIb/DO      FA/DO
Only scars, carved into stone
       DO
On the face of it
             
The moon is up

We see the sun go down

 And in the world, a heart of darkness

A fire zone
      SIb/DO            FA/DO
Where poets speak their heart
     DO
Then bleed for it
                      FA/DO
Jara sang, his song a weapon
                 
In the hands of one
           SIb         FA/DO
Though his blood still cries
         DO
From the ground

               SIb  FA
It runs like a river

 I don't believe in painted roses

Or bleeding hearts

While bullets rape the night
       DO
Of the merciful

I'll see you again when the stars

Fall from the sky

And the moon has turned red

To the sea

And when it's raining
       DO
Raining hard
                SIb      FA
That's when the rain will
