I have climbed the highest mountains

I have run through the fields
        SOLb
Only to be with you
           REb
Only to be with you
          
I have run I have crawled
                  SOLb
I have scaled these city walls
           REb
Only to be with you
      LAb             SOLb
But I still haven't found
            REb
What I'm looking for
      LAb             SOLb
But I still haven't found
            REb
What I'm looking for

       REb
I have kissed honey lips

Felt the healing in her fingertips
            SOLb
It burned like fire
            REb
This burning desire

I have spoke with the tongue of angels

I have held the hand of a devil
               SOLb
It was warm in the night
               REb
I was cold as a stone
      LAb             SOLb
But I still haven't found
            REb
What I'm looking for
      LAb             SOLb
But I still haven't found
            REb
What I'm looking for

    REb
I believe in the Kingdom Come
                                SOLb
Then all the colors will bleed into one
                 REb      
But yes I'm still running

You broke the bonds

You loosened the chains You carried the cross

And my shame
     SOLb
And my shame
             REb
You know I believed it
      LAb             SOLb
But I still haven't found
            REb
What I'm looking for
      LAb             SOLb
But I still haven't found
            REb
What I'm looking for
      LAb             SOLb
But I still haven't found
            REb
What I'm looking for
      LAb             SOLb
But I still haven't found
            REb
What I'm looking for
