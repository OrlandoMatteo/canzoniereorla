MI       MI/SOL#
I'm not afraid
   LA               MI/SOL#
Of anything in this world
        SI              DO#m7
There's nothing you can throw at me
       LA              MI
That I haven't already heard
                   MI/SOL#
I'm just trying to find
  LA         MI/SOL#
A decent melody
  SI              DO#m7
A song that I can sing
      LA       MI
In my own company
DO#m                        LA
 I never thought you were a fool
FA#m7                 LA
 But darling, look at you (Ooh)
DO#m                LA
 You gotta stand up straight, 
               DO#m
carry your own weight
                      SI
These tears are going nowhere baby

MI     MI/SOL# LA           MI/SOL#
 You've got to get yourself together
           SI         DO#m
You've got stuck in a moment
            LA        MI
And now you can't get out of it
     MI/SOL#   LA         MI/SOL#
Don't say that later will be better
           SOL#/DO    DO#m
Now you're stuck in a moment
        LA                   MI
And you can't get out of it

MI            MI/SOL#
I will not forsake
    LA              MI/SOL#
The colors that you bring
    SI                DO#m7
The nights you filled with fireworks
     LA            MI
They left you with nothing
             MI/SOL#
I am still enchanted
       LA                MI/SOL#
By the light you brought to me
  SI                  DO#m7
I listen through your ears
 LA               MI             
Through your eyes I can see
DO#m            LA
 You are such a fool
FA#                LA
 To worry like you do... Oh
DO#m          LA
 I know it's tough
                       DO#m
And you can never get enough
                         SI
Of what you don't really need now
 
My, oh my

MI     MI/SOL# LA           MI/SOL#
 You've got to get yourself together
           SI         DO#m
You've got stuck in a moment
            LA        MI

Oh love,  look at you now
                    SOL#/DO    DO#m
You've got yourself stuck in a moment
        LA        MI
And you can't get out of it
FA#m7             
 I was unconscious, half asleep
    LA                                  MI
The water is warm 'til you discover how deep
FA#m7               
I wasn't jumping, for me it was a fall
       LA                           RE  SI
It's a long way down, to nothing at a-----ll

MI     MI/SOL# LA           MI/SOL#
 You've got to get yourself together
           SI         DO#m
You've got stuck in a moment
            LA        MI
And now you can't get out of it
     MI/SOL#   LA         MI/SOL#
Don't say that later will be better
           SOL#/DO
Now you're stuck in a moment
        LA        MI
And you can't get out of it

    MI/SOL# LA        MI/SOL#
And if the night runs over
SI   DO#m7  LA        MI
 And if the day won't last
    MI/SOL#  LA        MI/SOL#  
And if your way should falter
SOL#/DO DO#m7    LA    MI
 A------long the stony paths
    MI/SOL# LA        MI/SOL#
And if the night runs over
SI   DO#m7  LA        MI
 And if the day won't last
    MI/SOL#  LA        MI/SOL#  
And if your way should falter
SOL#/DO DO#m7    LA  
 A------long the stony paths

It's just a moment
                MI
This time will pass
