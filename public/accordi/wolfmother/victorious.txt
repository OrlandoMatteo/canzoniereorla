MI  MI/RE  LA/DO#

   MI             MI/RE
It seems the competition
   LA/DO#        MI
is riding on her tail
                        MI/RE
It seems that they were hoping she
LA/DO#           MI
hoping she would fail
                     MI/RE
The time has come to raise
    LA/DO#           MI
our gauntlets to the sun
                      MI/RE
But she will prove herself worthy
LA/DO#          MI
She will be the one

MI       RE    LA/DO# MI
She will be victo--rious
           RE      LA        MI
Hate won't get the better of us
         RE/FA# LA  MI
Her ways are mysterious
                RE   LA/DO# MI   
'Cause she will be victo--rious

MI  MI/RE  LA/DO#  MI

   MI                  MI/RE
It seems that they are plotting now
LA/DO#       MI
all about destruction
                     MI/RE
With the things that they have made
 LA/DO#             MI
around their own construction
                       MI/RE
And can't you see that we are all
    LA/DO#         MI
the masters of our destiny?
                MI/RE
And she won't become the victim
 LA/DO#       MI
of your faded memory

MI       RE    LA/DO# MI
She will be victo--rious
           RE      LA        MI
Hate won't get the better of us
         RE/FA# LA  MI
Her ways are mysterious
                RE   LA/DO# MI   
'Cause she will be victo--rious

MI  MI/RE  LA  MI

MI                 RE/MI
Don't you ever get tired
    LA               MI
and feel like giving up?
               RE/MI
Don't you ever feel like
LA               MI
like you've had enough?
                   RE/MI
Don't you ever get tired
   LA                        MI
of wondering what's wrong or right?
                   RE/MI
Don't you ever get tired
    LA               MI
and feel like giving up?

   MI                MI/RE
It seems that others thought they could
LA/DO#               MI
take all their sweet time
                  MI/RE
Sippin' cocktails in the sun
  LA/DO#        MI
enjoying the sunshine
                  RE/FA#
She can't wait to unleash
LA/DO#          MI
unleash all her rage
            MI/RE
With an electric guitar
    LA/DO#            MI
and blow them off the stage

MI       RE    LA/DO# MI
She will be victo--rious
           RE      LA        MI
Hate won't get the better of us
         RE/FA# LA  MI
Her ways are mysterious
                RE   LA/DO# MI   
'Cause she will be victo--rious

MI  MI/RE  LA/DO#  MI

                RE   LA/DO#      MI   
'Cause she will be victo--rious
