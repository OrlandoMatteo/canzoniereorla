  Once I was a soldier
                       SOL7+
And I fought on foreign sands for you
RE             SOL7+    RE
  Once I was a hunter
                         SOL7+
And I brought home fresh meat for you
RE             SOL7+    RE
  Once I was a lover
                          SOL7+
And I searched behind your eyes for you
RE                      SOL7+    RE
  And soon there'll be another
               SOL7+          SIm
To tell you I was just a lie
                SOL
And sometimes I wonder
         LA        SIm
Just for a while
                       LA  LA4 SIm
Will you ever remember me

RE                      SOL7+
 And though you have forgotten
RE         SOL7+
 All of our rubbish dreams
RE             SOL7+
 I find myself searching
RE                     SOL7+
 Through the ashes of our ruins
RE                   SOL7+
 For the days when we smiled
RE                   SOL7+
 And the hours that ran wild
RE                   SOL7+
 With the magic of our eyes
RE                   SOL7+
 And the silence of our words
SIm              SOL
 And sometimes I wonder
         LA       SIm
Just for a while
                       LA  LA4 SIm
Will you ever remember me
LA                 SIm    RE
  ...Ever remember me...
