 I lit my purest candle close to my
LAb                   REb7+
 Window, hoping it would catch the eye
LAb                REb7+
 Of any vagabond who passed it by
SIbm7             REb      LAb
 And I waited in my fleeting house
                       REb7+
Before he came I felt him drawing near
LAb                      REb7+
 As he neared I felt the ancient fear
LAb                        REb7+
 That he had come to wound my door and jeer
SIbm7              REb       LAb
 And I waited in my fleeting house
MIb                  REbadd9  LAb/DO   REb7+
 "Tell me stories," I called  to   the Hobo
MIb                  REbadd9  LAb/DO  REb7+
 "Stories of cold," I smiled  at  the Hobo
MIb                  REbadd9 LAb/DO  REb7+
 "Stories of old," I knelt   to  the Hobo
SIbm7/4                 REb       LAb
 And he stood before my  fleeting house

LAb                        REb7+
 "No," said the Hobo, "No more tales of time
LAb                        REb7+
 Don't ask me now to wash away the grime
LAb                REb7+   
  I can't come in 'cause it's too high a climb"
SIbm7                     REb        LAb
 And he walked away from my fleeting house
MIb                    REbadd9    LAb/DO REb7+
 "Then you be damned!" I screamed to the Hobo
MIb                  REbadd9 LAb/DO REb7+
 "Leave me alone," I wept    to the Hobo
MIb                   REbadd9 LAb/DO REb7+
 "Turn into stone," I knelt   to the Hobo
SIbm7/4                    REb       LAb
 And he walked away from my  fleeting house
