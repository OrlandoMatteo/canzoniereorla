REb


I hold an image of the ashtray girl
FAm
 Of cigarette burns on my chest
REb
 I wrote a poem that described her world
FAm
 And put our friendship to the test
SIbm
 And late at night whilst on all fours
FAm
 She used to watch me kiss the floor
SOLb
 What's wrong with this picture?
