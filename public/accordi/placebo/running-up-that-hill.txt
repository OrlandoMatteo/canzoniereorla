It doesn't hurt me
                              
You want to feel how it feels?
                                       
You want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me?

You want to hear about the deal I'm making?
LAb   MIb  FAm
   You

(If I only could, be running up that hill)
LAb       MIb  FAm

(If I only could, be running up that hill)
    LAb
And if I only could
       SIb
Make a deal with God
    DOm
And get him to swap our places
                    LAb7+
Be running up that road
                    SIb
Be running up that hill
                    DOm
Be running up that building
           LAb7+  SIb   DOm
If I only could, ooh


You don't want to hurt me

But see how deep the bullet lies

Unaware that I'm tearing you asunder

And there's a thunder in our hearts, baby

There's so much hate for the ones we love

Tell me we both matter, don't we?
LAb  MIb  FAm
