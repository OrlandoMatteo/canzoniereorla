MI5  SOL6  DO7+  SI4

MI5     SOL6          DO7+
 I was alone, falling free
          SI4            MI5
Trying my best not to forget
                 SOL6                 DO7+
What happened to us, what happened to me
              SI4         MI5
What happened as I let it slip
         SOL6                     DO7+
I was confused by the powers that be
           SI4           MI5
Forgetting names and faces
        SOL6                DO7+
Passers by, were looking at me
           SI4           MI5
As if they could erase it
RE   DO7+        SI4              MIm
Baby, did you forget to take your meds?

       SOL6                   DO7+
I was alone, staring over the ledge
          SI4            MI5
Trying my best not to forget
              SOL6               DO7+
All manner of joy, all manner of glee
        SI4        MI5
And our one heroic pledge
                   SOL6                   DO7+
How it mattered to us, how it mattered to me
        SI4       MI5
And the consequences
         SOL6                        DO7+
I was confused, by the birds and the bees
           SI4          MI5
Forgetting if I meant it
