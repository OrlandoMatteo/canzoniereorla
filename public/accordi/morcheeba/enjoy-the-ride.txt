 Cutting with a knife, blood is spilling everywhere
               DO#5           RE#5
She will be my wife, secondary spine
                  DO#5                          RE#5
Incisions must be accurate, I know just what to do
                       DO#5                 
My hands are trembling I can't spare to slip up 
          LA#5
with this knife

RE#5            DO#5                          RE#5
 Her beauty so illogical, the beast come gliding in
           DO#5                     RE#5
Hideous chameleon stripped down to her skin
             DO#5                      RE#5
Dance to the burning flame, pleasure exhumes the pain
    DO#5              RE#5 MI5 DO#5 RE#5 SI5 DO#5
The night bursts into flame....

There's a spot on the floor 
                         SOL5
where your limbs used to be
      SIb5      FA5        SOL5
And I close the door on my fantasies...
