MIm7      LA         MIm7
 Flocking to the sea
                 LA
Crowds of people wait for me
MIm7           LA
 Sea gulls scavenge
                MIm7
Steal ice cream
           LA
Worries vanish
               
Within my dream


MI         LA6       SOL
 I left my soul there
     SIm       MI
Down by the sea
  LA               SOL
I lost control here
SIm         MI
Living free

LA9                           MIm7
Fishing boats sail past the shore
          LA9               MIm7
No singing may-day any more
               LA9
The sun is shining
                MIm7
The water's clear
               LA9                
Just you and I walk along the pier


MI         LA6      SOL

 A cool breeze flows but mind the wasp
                    LA7             MIm7
Some get stung it's worth the cost
                LA7
I'd love to stay
                  MIm7
The city calls me home
                      LA7 
More hassles fuss and lies on the phone


MI         LA6      SOL

By the sea...
