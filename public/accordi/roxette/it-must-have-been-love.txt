      DO
Lay a whisper on my pillow,
          FA            SOL
Leave the winter on the ground
          DO                     FA
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
       REm              SOL
In the bedroom and all around
         LAm             DO             FA    SOL
Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away

                   DO                 FA
It must have been love but it's over now
                   REm       LAm7        SOL
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
                   DO                 FA
It must have been love but it's over now
                   REm               LAm7         SOL
From the moment we touched, 'til the time had run out

       DO             
Make-believing we're together
         FA              SOL
That I'm sheltered by your heart
           DO                     FA
But in and outside I've turned to water
       REm             SOL
Like a teardrop in your palm
           LAm           DO           FA    SOL
And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away

                   DO                 FA
It must have been love but it's over now
                   REm            LAm7     SOL
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without

It must have been love but it's over now,
