In that big big house, there are fifty doors
    SOL7+
And one of them leads to your heart
       SIm                  
In the time of spring I passed your gate
    SOL7+
And tried to make a start
FA#m  MIm          FA#m             SIm
All I knew was the scent of sea and dew
LA                                       SI
 But I've been in love before, how about you?

A time to kill the pain in life

 Dream about the sun

You queen of rain

In that big old house there are fifty beds
    SOL7+
And one of them leads to your soul
       SIm
It's a bed of fear, a bed of threats
  SOL7+
Regrets and sheets so cold
FA#m  MIm       FA#m           SIm
All I knew your eyes so velvet blue
LA                                   SI
 I've been in love before, how about you?

 It's time to place your bets in life

I've played the loser's game of life
