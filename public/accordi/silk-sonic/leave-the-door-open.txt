RE  LA  MI  FA#m

RE    LA                      MI
 And another one bites the dust
    FA#m                    RE
But why can I not conquer love?
       LA                       MI
And I might've got to be with one
        FA#m                        RE
Why not fight this war without weapons?
              LA                 MI
And I want it and I wanted it bad
    FA#m                     RE
But there were so many red flags
      LA                    MI   
Now another one bites the dust
    FA#m                        RE
And let's be clear, I trust no one
        LA          MI  FA#m  RE
You did not break me
          LA            MI  FA#m  
I'm still fighting for peace

     RE              LA                   MI      
Well I've got thick skin and an elastic heart
     FA#m                       
But your blade it might be too sharp
    RE             LA                      MI
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
    FA#m                    
But I may snap when I move close
    RE            LA       MI   FA#m
But you won't see me fall apart
       RE            LA     MI   FA#m
'Cause I've got an elastic heart
RE           LA       MI   FA#m

      RE            LA     MI   FA#m

RE   LA                           MI
 And I will stay up through the night
FA#m                              RE
Let's be clear, I won't close my eyes
    LA                    MI 
And I know that I can survive
  FA#m                            RE
I walked through fire to save my life
      LA                         MI
And I want it, I want my life so bad
        FA#m                RE
And I'm doing everything I can
       LA                   MI
Then another one bites the dust
     FA#m                   RE
It's hard to lose a chosen one
        LA         MI    FA#m  RE
