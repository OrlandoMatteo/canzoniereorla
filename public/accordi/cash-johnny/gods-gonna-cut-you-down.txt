Well my goodness gracious let me tell you the news

My head's been wet with the midnight dew
                        
I've been down on bended knee
                          
Talkin' to the man from Galilee
                               
He spoke to me in the voice so sweet
                                             
I thought I heard the shuffle of the angel's feet
                               
He called my name and my heart stood still
                              
When he said, "John, go do my will!"

Well you may throw your rock and hide your hand
                                
Workin' in the dark against your fellow man
      
But as sure as God made black and white
                                                
What's down in the dark will be brought to the light
