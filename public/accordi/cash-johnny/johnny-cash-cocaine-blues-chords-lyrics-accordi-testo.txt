We fell in love
       LAb/SOLb
On the first night that we met
  FAm7
Together we've been happy
       SIbm7
I have very few regrets
    SOLm7/5- DO7  
The ordinary problems
     FAm
Have not been hard to face
    SIbm7         MIb7
But lately little changes
          MIbm7         LAb
Have been slowly taking place
       FA7            SIbm
You're always finding something
   SOLb            REb
Is wrong in what I do
    FAm7         SIbm7
But you can't rearrange my life
  MIbm7            LAb7/4
Because it pleases you

SOLb/LAb      REb         LAb/DO
You've got to love me for what I am
    SIbm7
For simply being me
      MIbm7
Don't love me for what you intend
   LAb7/4           LAb
Or hope that I will be
    FAm7
And if you're only using me
   DOm7/4         FA7
To feed your fantasy
       SIbm7         MIb9
You're really not in love
      MIbm7  LAb7/4     REb   SOLb/REb  REb
So let me go, I must be free

            SOLbadd9
If what you want
      LAb/SOLb
Isn't natural for me
  FAm7
I won't pretend to keep you
       SIbm
What I am I have to be
    SOLm7/5-      DO7
The picture of perfection
   FAm          
Is only in your mind
    SIbm7         MIb7
For all your expectations
         MIbm7      LAb
Love can never be designed
   FA7              SIbm
We either take each other
    SOLb7+        REb
For everything we are
   FAm7                 SIbm
Or leave the life we've made behind
    MIbm7        LAb7
And make another start

SOLb/LAb      REb         LAb/DO
You've got to love me for what I am
    SIbm7
For simply being me
      MIbm7
Don't love me for what you intend
   LAb7/4           LAb
Or hope that I will be
    FAm7
And if you're only using me
   DOm7/4         FA7
To feed your fantasy
       SIbm7         MIb9
You're really not in love
      MIbm7  LAb7/4     
So let me go, I must be free...

REb  LAb/DO  SIbm7     MIbm7    LAb7/4  LAb

    FAm7
And if you're only using me
   DOm7/4         FA7
To feed your fantasy
       SIbm7         MIb9
You're really not in love
      MIbm7  LAb7/4    SOLm7/5-
So let me go, I must be free...

REb/LAb   FA7

       SIbm7         MIb9
You're really not in love
          MIbm7  LAb7/4
So let me go, 
          REb  SOLb/REb  REb
I must be free...
