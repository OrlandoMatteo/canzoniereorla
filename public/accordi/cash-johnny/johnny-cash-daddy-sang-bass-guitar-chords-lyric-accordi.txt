I remember when I was a Lad
           SIb		        FA
Times were Hard and things were Bad

But there's a Silver Linin' Behind Every Cloud

Just poor People that's all we Were
 	         SIb                     FA
Try'n' to make a Livin' outta blackland Dirt

Daddy sang bass
           
Momma sang Tenor

Mama would call in all of us
