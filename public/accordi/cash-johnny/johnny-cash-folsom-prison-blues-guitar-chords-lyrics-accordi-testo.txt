I hear the train a-coming, it's rolling round the bend
                                                 MI7  
and I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
    LA                                              MI   
I'm stuck at Folsom Prison, and time keeps draggin' on
         SI7
But that train keeps a-rollin' on
              MI
down to San Antone

     MI
When I was just a baby, my Mama told me 'Son,
                                           MI7
always be a good boy; don't ever play with guns.'
      LA                                    MI
But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die
       SI7
when I hear that whistle blowin'
                   MI
I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dining car
                                                   MI7
They're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars
      LA                                      MI
But I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
          SI7
But those people keep a moving
                         MI
and that's what tortures me

Strumentale:
MI   MI7   LA   MI   SI7   MI

              MI
Well, if they freed me from this prison

if that railroad train was mine
                                               MI7
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
LA                                             MI
Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay
        SI7
And I'd let that lonesome whistle
               MI
blow my blues away
