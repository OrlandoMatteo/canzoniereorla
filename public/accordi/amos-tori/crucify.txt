
SOL#5                LA#5
 Every finger in the room
   FA#5        SOL#5
Is pointing at me
                      LA#5
I wanna spit in their faces
FA#5
 Then I get afraid of what that could bring
        SOL#5              LA#5
I got a bowling ball in my stomach
        FA#5         SOL#5
I got a desert in my mouth
                LA#5
Figures that my courage would choose to 
FA#5
 sell out now

I've been raising up my hands
              SOL#m
Drive another nail in

Just what God needs

One more victim

 Got a kick for a dog
FA#5         SOL#5
Beggin' for love

I gotta have my suffering
      FA#5
So that I can have my cross
        SOL#5       LA#5
I know a cat named Easter
       FA#5              SOL#5
He says, "Will you ever learn?
                      LA#5
You're just an empty cage, girl,
      FA#5    
If you kill the bird"
