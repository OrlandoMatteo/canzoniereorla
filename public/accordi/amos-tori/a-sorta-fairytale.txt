On my way   up north, up on the Ventura
 SIbm   FAm       MIb
I pulled back the hood and I was talking to you
     SIbm  FAm            MIb
And I knew  then it would be a life long thing
            SIbm  FAm   MIb
But I didn't know  that we, 
         MIb7
we could break a silver lining

      FAm  REb    
And I'm  so   sad
FAm7             MIb             FAm  REb
 Like a good book I can't put this day back
FAm7  MIb                FAm
 A sorta fairytale with you
       REb               FAm7
(A sorta fairytale with you)
        MIb            FAm REb   LAb MIb
A sorta fairytale with you

           SIbm FAm    MIb
Things you said  that day up on the one-oh-one
  SIbm     FAm      MIb
The girl had come undone, I tried to downplay it
      SIbm FAm     MIb
With a bet   about us, you said that you'd take it
  SIbm FAm     MIb                 MIb7
As long  as I could, I could not erase it

      FAm  REb    
And I'm  so   sad
FAm7             MIb             FAm  REb
 Like a good book I can't put this day back
FAm7  MIb                FAm
 A sorta fairytale with you
       REb               FAm7
(A sorta fairytale with you)
        MIb            FAm REb   LAb MIb
A sorta fairytale with you

      FAm        REb
And I ride along side
      FAm        MIb
And I rode along side you then
      FAm        REb
And I rode along side
         FAm            MIb
Till you lost me there in the open road
      FAm        REb
And I rode along side
         LAb          MIb
Till the honey spread itself so thin
      SIbm
For me to break your bread
     REbadd9            MIb    
For me to take your word
     FAm      REb  LAb MIb
I had to steal it

FAm         REb/FA
Way up north I took my day
MIb              SIbm
All in all was a pretty nice day
     FAm           REb/FA
And I put the hood right back where
MIb              SIbm
 You could taste heaven perfectly
FAm           REb/FA
 Feel out the summer breeze
MIb              SIbm
Didn't know when we'd be back
      FAm       REb/FA
And I, I don't, didn't think
     MIb        LAb MIb
We'd end up like,   ...like this

      FAm  REb    
And I'm  so   sad
FAm7             MIb             FAm  REb
 Like a good book I can't put this day back
FAm7  MIb                FAm
 A sorta fairytale with you
       REb               FAm7
(A sorta fairytale with you)
        MIb            FAm REb  FAm7
A sorta fairytale with you
        MIb            FAm REb  FAm7  MIb
A sorta fairytale with you...
