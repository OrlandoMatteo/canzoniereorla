
        FA
I wanna smash your fears
        REm
And get drunken off your tears
          SIb
Don't you share your smile 
                     FA
with anyone else but me

I wanna touch your heart
        REm
I wanna crush it in my hands
         SIb
Make you plead and cry
                       FA
As you give up all the lies
          
We're not lovers
              REm7
But more than friends
      SIb                            FA
Put a flame to every single word you ever said

No more crying
          REm7
To get me through
          SIb             
I'll keep dancing 'til the morning 
         FA
with somebody new
 
                         FA
Tonight I'm getting over you
                         REm
Tonight I'm getting over you
                         SIb
Tonight I'm getting over you

Tonight I'm getting over you
                 FA   REm   SIb   FA
Over you  Over you...

           REm
Stuck in a real bad dream

And man it feels so new to me
          SIb
Should be in your arms
                        FA
But I'm begging at your feet
            
It's been a real hard night
           REm
And I just hold my pillow tight
         SIb
It won't love me back, no
                 FA
It's not you and I

We're not lovers
              REm7
But more than friends
      SIb                            FA
Put a flame to every single word you ever said

No more crying
          REm7
To get me through
          SIb       
I'll keep dancing 'til the morning 
         FA
with somebody new

We're not lovers
