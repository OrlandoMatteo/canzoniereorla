SOL7
 Reflections in my mind
SOL7/4
 Thoughts I can't define
SOL7                        FA         DO/MI
 My heart is racing and the night goes on
SOL7
I can almost hear a laugh
SOL7/4
Coming from your photograph
SOL7                          FA       DO/MI
 Funny how a look can share a thousand meanings
SOL7
 Well-intended lies
SOL7/4
Contemplating alibis
SOL7                       FA     DO/MI
 Is it really you or is it me I'm blaming?
SOL7
 A distant memory
SOL7/4
 Flashes over me
SOL7                                DO/MI   FA/LA
 Even though you're gone I feel you deep inside...

SOL7
There's a window in the heart
     SOL7/4
I've tried to look through from the start
SOL7
 You're never really sure 
             FA      DO/MI
what someone else is thinking
SOL7
Someone's broken something new
 SOL7/4
Another altered point of view
SOL7                      FA         DO/MI
 Just a certain someone's conscience playing
SOL7
 I held it in my hand
SOL7/4
 I did not understand
SOL7                             FA        DO/MI
 What lives inside the wind that cries her name
SOL7
Trying to catch a shooting star
     SOL7/4
What seems so close can't be that far
SOL7                           DO/MI   FA/LA
 I'm living in a dream that's never ending
