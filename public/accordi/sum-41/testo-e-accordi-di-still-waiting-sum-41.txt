 Drop dead a bullet to my head
MIm                    SOL
 Your words are like a gun in hand
MIm                   SIb5
 You can't change the state of the nation
SOL           SIm
 We just need some motivation
MIm           SIb5
Since I have seen no conviction
MIm            SOL
 Just lies and more contradiction
MIm         SIb5
 So tell me what would you say
SOL          SIm
 I'd say its up, to me

 We're the first ones to jump in line
MIm              SIb5
 Out of step for what we believe in
SOL                SIm
 But whos left? To start the pleading
MIm      SIb5
 How far will we take this
MIm               SOL
 It's not hard to see through the thickness
