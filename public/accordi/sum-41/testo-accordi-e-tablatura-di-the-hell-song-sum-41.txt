 Everybody's got their problems
SI                  FA#
 Everybody says the same things to you
SOL#m                          MI
 It's just a matter of how you solve them
SI
 And knowing how to change
    FA#
the things you've been through
SOL#m        MI
 I feel I've come to realize
SI             FA#
 how fast life can be compromised
SOL#m         MI
 Step back to see what's going on
SI         FA#
 I can't believe this happened to
SOL#m   MI   SI   FA#
You...         .....this happened to
SOL#m   MI   SI   FA#
You...

 Complications ended first in this line
SI                              FA#
 with all this pictures running through my mind
SOL#m            MI
 knowing endless.. consequences
SI         FA#
 I feel so useless in this
SOL#m          MI
 Get back step back and as
    SI           FA#
for me I can't believe

        SOL#m     MI
Part of me won't agree
              SI               FA#
cause I don't know if it's for sure
      SOL#m    MI
Suddenly suddenly
        SI          FA#
I don't feel so insecure
