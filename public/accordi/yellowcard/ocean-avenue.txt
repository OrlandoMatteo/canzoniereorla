 There's a place off Ocean Avenue
                                    MI5
Where I used to sit and talk with you
              FA#5             RE5
We were both 16 and it felt so right
                               MI  FA#m7  RE
Sleeping all day staying up all (Night)
              MI  FA#m7  RE
Staying up all (Night)
MI5                     FA#5             RE5
 There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street
                                          MI5
We would walk on the beach in our bare feet
              FA#5              RE5
We were both 18 and it felt so right
                               MI  FA#m7  RE

If I could find you now things would get better
         MI          FA#m7         RE
We could leave this town and run forever
         MI           FA#m7         RE
Let your waves crash down on me and take me away

MI5                FA#5                RE5
There's a piece of you thats here with me

It's everywhere I go its everything I see
MI5            FA#5                  RE5
When I sleep I dream and it gets me by
                                    MI  FA#m7  RE
I can make believe that you're here (Tonight)
                 MI  FA#m7  RE
That you're here (Tonight)

           MI        FA#m7               RE

           MI         FA#m7         RE
I know somewhere somehow we'll be together
         MI           FA#m7         RE
Let your waves crash down on me and take me away

LAadd9    FA#m7    MI4    REadd9

LAadd9
 I remember the look in your eyes
FA#m7
 When I told you that this was goodbye
MI4
 You were begging me not tonight
    REadd9
Not here, not now
LAadd9
 We're looking up at the same night sky
FA#m7
 And keep pretending the sun will not rise
MI4
 Well be together 
                       REadd9
for one more night somewhere somehow
