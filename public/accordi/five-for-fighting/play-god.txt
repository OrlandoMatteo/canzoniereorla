
SIbm
 You were cracking all your fingers

With your eyes fixed to the floor

Sound had echoed down the street
                    SIbm
By the monument you hear

Man is screaming through a megaphone
                               
"Get your hands off the Middle East"

Every word would herd the cynical
                          SOLb
Every word would cut your teeth
         MIb5    SIbm    SOLb
And he will play God
         MIb5    SIbm
And he will play God

SIbm
 It's all the same down in the capital

All the suits and cladded feet
                            
Sewer rats will shower the underground
                     SOLb
In a race to make ends meet
         MIb5    SIbm    SOLb
And he will play God
         MIb5    SIbm  LAb
And he will play God

SOLb
 Am I mistaken
MIbm
 Or are we breaking
  SIbm                          LAb
Under weight from the long time
                   SOLb
That he played God?

Am I mistaken
MIbm
 Or are we breaking
  SIbm                          LAb
Under weight from the long time
                   SOLb
That he played God?
       MIb5       SIbm
And he will play God

SIbm
 No matter who you are or where you've been

He is watching from a screen

Keeps a keen eye on the in-between
                       SOLb
From the people to the Queen
         MIb5    SIbm   LAb
And he will play God
SOLb   MIb5    SIbm   LAb
  He will play God

SOLb
 Am I mistaken
MIbm
 Or are we breaking
  SIbm                         LAb
Under weight from the long time
                   SOLb
That he played God?

Am I mistaken
MIbm
 Or are we breaking
  SIbm                         LAb
Under weight from the long time
                   SOLb
That he played God?
    MIb5     SIbm  LAb  SOLb
He will play God
    MIb5     SIbm  LAb  SOLb
He will play God
   MIb5      SIbm  LAb  SOLb
He will play God
   MIb5      SIbm  LAb  SOLb  MIb5
He will play God...
