                         RE#m7   DO#
I've been thinking about you, my love
    LA#m7                     SIadd9     DO#
And all the crazy things that you put me through
        RE#m7          DO#               LA#m7 SIadd9
Now I'm coming around, Throwing it back to  you
         DO#         RE#m7       DO#
Were you thinking of me when you kissed him
          LA#m7             SIadd9     DO#
Could you taste me when you licked his skin
RE#m7           DO#               LA#m7          SIadd9 DO#
All the while I showered you with trust and promises
         SOL#m7              LA#m7/4
What I'm needing now is some sweet revenge
   SIadd9            DO#
To get back all that I lost then
  SOL#m7         LA#m7/4     
I gave you all I had to give, 
    SIadd9        DO#        DO#4 DO#
but I could never reach you...

 RE#m7 DO#  LA#m7     SIadd9   DO#
Adrienne, I thought I knew you
 RE#m7 DO#      LA#m7    SIadd9 DO#
Once again, you used me, used me
 RE#m7 DO#  LA#m7       SIadd9  DO#
Adrienne, I should have left you
 RE#m7  DO#     LA#m7    SIadd9 DO# RE#m7 DO#  LA#m7
Long before you used me, Used   me  up

SI DO#      RE#m7           DO#
   Spent my money, drove my car
  LA#m7              SIadd9   DO#
I treated you like a shining star
    RE#m7     DO#           LA#m7  SIadd9 
But in my sky all burnt out you are
    DO#           REm7 DO#
And I'll have the last laugh, 
       LA#m7        
when I see you walking with
     SIadd9  DO#
some other guy
         RE#m7            DO#         LA#m7 SIadd9 DO#
'Cause I know you're gone end up all alone
   SOL#m7                 LA#m7/4
So take these words, some good advice
SI                    DO#
All you've done gonna come back twice
    SOL#m7          LA#m7/4    
You never cared how much it hurt, 
  SIadd9         DO#       DO#4 DO#
