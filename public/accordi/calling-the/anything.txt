I will be there

Always waiting

Waiting for you

To let me inside
                MIb
Where your fire burns

In a city of angels

And as you sleep
            LAb
Eyes to the window
                 MIb
I'm watching you dream
                       LAb
Well are you dreaming of me?
             MIb
So why can't you see
                LAb
You're all that matters

You know if this earth should crack

I'll be your solid ground
          DOm                SIb           LAb
I will be there to catch you when you fall down

             MIb
Whatever you want
             LAb
Whatever you need
            DOm         SIb   LAb
Whatever it takes, I'll do anything
             MIb     
If I have to crawl
               LAb
Get down on my knees
            DOm          SIb   LAb
Whatever it takes, I'll do anything
