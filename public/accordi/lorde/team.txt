
SOLb
Wait 'til you're announced

We've not yet lost all our graces

The hounds will stay in chains

Look upon Your Greatness and she'll send the call out

(Send the call out...)

SOLb
 Call all the ladies out
                       MIbm
They're in their finery
                            REb
A hundred jewels on throats
                             SOLb
A hundred jewels between teeth

Now bring my boys in
                                 MIbm
Their skin in craters like the moon
                            REb
The moon we love like a brother, 
                            
while he glows through the room
SOLb
Dancin' around the lies we tell
                                MIbm
Dancin' around big eyes as well
                 REb
Even the comatose they don't dance and tell

SI               MIbm                  REb
 We live in cities you'll never see on screen
                                         MIbm
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
SI             MIbm                    REb
 Living in ruins of a palace within my dreams
                    MIbm            SI  
And you know, we're on each other's team

            MIbm    
I'm kind of over getting told to 
         REb                           SOLb
throw my hands up in the air, so there
                                              MIbm
So all the cups got broke shards beneath our feet 
                        REb    SOLb
but it wasn't my fault
                                                   MIbm
And everyone's competing for a love they won't receive
                        REb
'Cause what this palace wants is release

So there
          MIbm                      REb
I'm kinda older than I was when I revelled without a care
