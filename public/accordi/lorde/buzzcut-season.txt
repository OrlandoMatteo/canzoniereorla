 I remember when your head caught flame
FAm                                        LAb
 It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
                                      
(I remember when your head caught flame)
FAm                               LAb
 Well, you laughed, baby, it's okay
FAm                       LAb
 It's buzzcut season anyway

Explosions on TV
            MIb        FAm         MIb FAm      
And all the girls with heads inside a  dream
       MIb REb
So now we  live beside the pool
           MIb      FAm     MIb FAm     MIb
Where everything is good

FAm              MIb      FAm       
 We ride the bus with the knees 
     MIb LAb   MIb LAb   MIb
pulled in
FAm            MIb FAm         MIb LAb
 People should see how we're living
                 MIb      LAb           MIb
(We ride the bus with the knees pulled in)
FAm           MIb    FAm     
 Shut my eyes to the song 
       MIb LAb   MIb LAb   MIb 
that plays
FAm             MIb   FAm         MIb LAb
 Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste
              MIb    LAb          MIb
(Shut my eyes to the song that plays)
    REb
The men up on the news
            MIb     FAm        MIb   FAm  
They try to tell us all that we will lose
            MIb
But it's so easy in this blue
                    FAm    MIb FAm
Where everything is good

               MIb REb
And I'll never go  home again
                         MIb
(Place the call, feel it start)

(And nothing's wrong, when nothing's true)
                     LAb  FAm    MIb FAm
I live in a hologram with you
                          MIb REb
We're all the things that we  do for fun
                          MIb
(And I'll breathe, and it goes)
FAm        MIb
Play along
 FAm                       MIb
(Make-believe it's hyper real)
                              FAm    MIb FAm
But I live in a hologram with you

Cola with the burnt-out taste
                          MIb
I'm the one you tell your fears to
                            FAm
There'll never be enough of us
