 I do my make-up in somebody else's car
FA#m                LA                  RE
 We order different drinks at the same bars
FA#m                   LA                          RE

Thought you said that you would always be in love 
                           RE    
But you're not in love, no more

Did it frighten you
                                             MI
How we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?
