There's a stranger in my bed,
          SOL#m7
There's a pounding in my head
            RE#m7
Glitter all over the room
        DO#
Pink flamingos in the pool
        SI
I smell like a mini-bar
    SOL#m7
DJs passed out in the yard
        RE#m7
Barbies on the barbecue
       DO#

Last Friday night

Last Friday night

Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
                          RE#m7
And got kicked out of the bar
                   DO#
So we hit the boulevard
            SI
Last Friday night
                         SOL#m7
We went streaking in the park
                      RE#m7
Skinny dipping in the dark
                    DO#
Then had a ménage à trois
            SI

Don't know what to tell my boss

Think the city towed my car
      DO#
Chandelier is on the floor
          SI
Ripped my favorite party dress
         SOL#m7
Warrants out for my arrest
        RE#m7
