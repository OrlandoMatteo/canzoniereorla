My girl, she ain't the one that I saw coming
    MI               LA                 REadd9
And sometimes I don't know which way to go
      MI             LA
And I tried to run before
            REadd9
But I'm not running anymore
           MI               LA               REadd9
Cause I've fought against it hard enough to know

That you love, who you love
        REadd9

My boy, he ain't the one that I saw coming
    MI                LA               REadd9
And some have said his heart's too hard to hold
       MI             LA
And it takes a little time
               REadd9
But you should see him when he shines
          MI          LA            REadd9
Cause you never wanna let that feeling go
