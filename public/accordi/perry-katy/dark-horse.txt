Of anything and everything

Make me your one and only

Mark my words

This love will make you levitate

Like a bird

Like a bird without a cage

But down to earth

If you choose to walk away, don’t walk away
                       
It’s in the palm of your hand now baby

It’s a yes or no, no maybe

I call her Karma (come back)

She eats your heart out

Like Jeffrey Dahmer (woo)

Be careful

Try not to lead her on

Shorty’s heart is on steroids

Cause her love is so strong

You may fall in love

When you meet her

If you get the chance you better keep her

She's sweet as pie but if you break her heart

She'll turn cold as a freezer

That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor

She can be my Sleeping Beauty

I’m gon’ put her in a coma

Woo!
