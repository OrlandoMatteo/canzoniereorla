MI    SOL#m   

MI                            
I never thought that You would be 
                   SOL#m
the one to hold my heart
    MI
But you came around
                   
And you knocked me off the ground 
         SOL#m
from the start
LA           SI          LA
You put your arms around me
        SI              MI
And I believe that it's easier 
           SI     LA     SI
for you to let me go
    LA             SI               MI
You put your arms around me and I'm home
                         
How many times will let you me 
                         SOL#m
change my mind and turn around
MI     
I can't decide if I'll let you 
                        SOL#m
save my life or if I'll drown

DO#m             SI        MI          LA
 I hope that you see right through my walls
DO#m             SI
 I hope that you catch me, 
           MI       LA
'cause I'm already falling
DO#m        SI     MI          LA 
 I'll never let a love get so close
                   SI                MI
You put your arms around me and I'm home

SOL#m    MI    SOL#m

    MI                       
The world is coming down on me
                                SOL#m
And I can't find a reason to be loved
  MI
I never wanna leave you
                                   SOL#m
But I can't make you bleed if I'm alone

You put your arms around me

in to see the truth

And I've never opened up
           SOL#m             LA
I've never truly loved 'till you 
         SI          LA
put your arms around me
