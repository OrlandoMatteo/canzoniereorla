 I’m losing my self control
                      MIb          REb  MIb
Yeah, you start and I trickle back in
LAb                MIb           REb         MIb
 But I don’t wanna fall down the rabbit hole
LAb                      MIb    REb       
 Cross my heart, I won’t do it again
  FAm7                                    MIb      REb
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, “Draw the line”
            MIb
And I do, I do
    FAm7                              MIb       REb
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
             MIb   LAb
And think of you

                    MIb   REb
Two years, and just like that
                    MIb FAm7
My head still takes me back
                     DOm7 REb
Thought it was done, but I
                 MIb        LAb
Guess it’s never really over
                 MIb REb
Oh, we were such a   mess
              MIb  FAm7
But wasn’t it the best?
                     DOm7 REb
Thought it was done, but I
                        
Guess it’s never really over

LAb                                             MIb
Just because it’s over doesn’t mean it’s really over
     REb                                       MIb   FAm7
And if I think it over, maybe you’ll be coming over again
                                        REbadd9  MIb
And I’ll have to get over you all over again
LAb                       
Just because it’s over doesn’t mean it’s really over
     REb                                       MIb   FAm7

                                  DOm7   REbadd9  MIb
And I’ll have to get over you all over again

LAb              MIb      REb      MIb
 I guess I could try hypnotherapy
LAb        MIb       REb    MIb LAb
 I gotta rewire this brain
                    MIb       REb      MIb
‘Cause I can’t even go on the internet
LAb           MIb           REb   MIb
 Without even checking your name
  FAm7                                    MIb      REb
I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, “Draw the line”
            MIb
And I do, I do
    FAm7                              MIb       REb
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line

LAb                MIb    REbadd9
 Thought we kissed goodbye
                  MIb   FAm7
Thought we meant this time was the last
DOm7  REbadd9                MIb   LAb
But I guess it’s never really over
                MIb  REbadd9                  MIb
Thought we drew the line right through you and I
FAm7               DOm7
 Can’t keep going back
 REb                       LAb MIb REb
I guess it’s never really over,    yeah
