LAb         DOm      FAm
 I will not make the same mistakes that you did
MIb        DOm
I will not let myself
FAm                          MIb LAb
Cause my heart so much misery
           DOm       FAm
I will not break the way you did
            MIb  LAb
You fell so hard
                 DOm
I've learned the hard way
   FAm                   MIb
To never let it get that far

           FAm
Because of you
         REb                   MIb
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
           FAm
Because of you
                         REb
I learned to play on the safe side 
     MIb
so I don't get hurt
DO7         SIbm7
 Because of you
                  LAb/DO         MIb
I find it hard to trust not only me, 
              DO7
but everyone around me
           REb7+
Because of you
      MIb
I am afraid

LAb        DOm
 I lose my way
         FAm                     MIb       LAb
And it's not too long before you point it out
         DOm
I cannot cry
  FAm                          MIb     LAb
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
              DOm
I'm forced to fake
  FAm                  MIb      LAb    
A smile, a laugh everyday of my life
               DOm
My heart can't possibly break
        FAm                  MIb
When it wasn't even whole to start with

           FAm
Because of you

but everyone around me
           REb7+
Because of you
      MIb
I am afraid
              DOm
I watched you die
            FAm                MIb
I heard you cry every night in your sleep
         DOm
I was so young
                FAm                  MIb
You should have known better than to lean on me
          DOm               FAm
You never thought of anyone else
             MIb
You just saw your pain
          DOm                      FAm
And now I cry in the middle of the night
        MIb              
For the same damn thing

           FAm
Because of you

I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
